# MIT807 Mini Thesis - The Power of Metadata in Bibliometrics

Topical bibliometric studies within the Technology Management research area.

Technology and innovation management (TIM) is a rapidly growing research area.  Qualitative research reviews in the TIM research area fail to capture the advancements in the field because it is too time-consuming and reviews only a small sample of the research body population.  Digital libraries of academic publications have enabled quantitative statistical analysis of large corpora of digital publications.  Topical bibliometric studies of these textual documents help to identify emerging trends and map the importance of various topics in the TIM research area through the use of natural language processing.  However, most approaches only consider latent topics from the titles or abstract text of publications.  They fail to capture the impact of metadata on the classification task â€“ like the author, journal name and the number of citations.  This study proposes the use of structural topic modelling in topical bibliometric analysis.  Metadata is used to refine the topic classification in the TIM research area.
