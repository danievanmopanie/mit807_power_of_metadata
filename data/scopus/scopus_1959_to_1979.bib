abstract={Successful innovation in industrial products can be carried out by means of a carefully planned innovation process. This paper describes such a process carried out in a company that faced heavy financial losses due to an obsolete product mix. The total process took about two years, during which a new industrial product was acquired, the organization was adapted, the market introduction was started, and financial resources from outside the company were successfully obtained. The innovation process can be divided in different steps: objective formulation, potential product search, licence search or product development, negotiation, and finally market introduction. The first two steps were carried out in order to direct product development and licence search efforts as effectively as possible. As a result potential product licences were traced, on which none or only little furtner product development was needed. All this was fairly simple and took only a few months. During the negotiation (the next step), a very strong internal promotion of the most promising potential product licence was carried out at all decision levels, whilst at the same time the acquisition of this product licence was negotiated. Altogether this period lasted more than one year. Finally, a licence for a new product was acquired, after which the market introduction was started, resulting in a multimillion guiders turnover within less than two years after the start of the innovation process. The success of this product innovation resulted from careful planning and management of the whole process by an innovation manager, in cooperation with a task force, and from the considerable effort spent on internal company promotion. At the same time, pulling the selected new product through problem areas, and turning it into a commercial success, was the most creative part of this product innovation process. © 1979.},

abstract={At least half of Nigeria's urban dwellers live in slum conditions as a result of massive rural-urban migration, the 'quality' of the migrants and the slow rate at which they are assimilated into the urban economy. Rapid population growth leads to areal expansion of the city and suburban settlements become incorporated as urban slums. Much of the pre-industrial housing technology is obsolescent and inferior. There is a lack of commitment to the wellbeing of the urban area and the ineffectiveness of the planning and management agencies intensifies slum conditions. The 'bulldozer' approach to the problem gives inadequate recognition to the human factors involved in slum development and more attention must be given to the provision of employment and to the creation of a sense of urban belonging and commitment.-D.Hilling rural urban migration population growth pre industrial housing technology management agencies bulldozer approach Nigeria},

abstract={This survey at {A figure is presented} shed light on the potential contribution of industrialization based on resource processing to efficient growth, employment creation, greater equity and economic independence. The use of capital-intensive methods to reduce raw material costs appears to confer comparative advantage on countries with cheap capital. Lower transport costs due to substantial weight reduction in processing may counter this advantage for some stages of processing, but does not universally favor LDC exporters. Most major producers export sufficient quantities to achieve scale economies typical of resource processing, but economies of scale are a barrier in processing for the domestic market in all except the largest LDCs. External economies of industrialization are also thought to favor processing in the industrial countries, but potential linkages could stimulate some complementary investments in LDCs. Because resource-based industries are not impressive contributors to direct or indirect employment creation, they are likely to perpetuate the pattern of dualism and inequality present in typical resource-rich countries. Third-world exporters may be barred from entry into resource processing by the dominance of multinational firms in the metals and petroleum industries; by shipping conference freight rates that discriminate against processed commodities; and by importing country tariff structures that provide substantial effective protection against many LDC semi-processed exports. Processing of natural resources for export tends to continue the broad pattern of trade, financial and technical dependence of developing countries, although market dependence may decrease at some stage of processing. Home-oriented processing avoids market dependence, but cannot escape outside dependency on technology, management and finance. © 1979.},

abstract={While demographic characteristics vary among programs, competencies and content emphasized in graduate study in instructional systems are common to a number of programs. For example, the master's degree is intended to prepare students for employment as instructional developers in business and industry. There is a noticeable lack of emphasis on preparation for employment in public or private elementary or secondary school settings, which is uncharacteristic of the typical master's degree program in education. Doctoral programs in instructional systems exhibit more variability in the areas of content, competencies, and the emphasis of competencies in an ideal program than do master's degree programs. Each program, along with an individual emphasis in a particular component of instructional systems, stresses research methodology. Thus, the faculties within the various programs and their respective graduates can pursue knowledge in instructional systems on a range of concerns. The most significant characteristic of the instructional systems programs surveyed is the nature of the curriculum and course offerings. Instructional development courses overwhelmingly outnumber all other courses, with secondary areas of emphasis being instructional psychology, visual technology, management, and research. The emphasis placed on content and competencies other than media is an indication of the present direction of instructional systems. Although many of the programs evolved from an earlier audiovisual orientation, present programs now represent a concern with process rather than product and show a healthy diversity of content emphases within instructional systems. © 1978 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

abstract={This survey was developed to determine the nature of the programs and courses in technology transfer now in existence in the United States. A pilot study approach was used, without operationalizing a definition, to avoid excluding possible technology transfer activities. Results indicate twenty colleges and universities offering courses in a wide range of academic settings including engineering, business, psychology, sociology, political science, environmental studies and agriculture. With the majority of respondents, technology transfer is studied as a combination of the history of science and technology, management, information science, and communication. In this sense, it appears to be an interdisciplinary study with a strong direction toward communication protocols, and management skills as primary outcomes. © 1978 Technology Transfer Society.},

In an effort to help management answer these and other related questions, the Babcock & Wilcox Company developed a systematic procedure to identify and assess current and future technology needs expected from the R&D division by the operating divisions. The procedure is equally applicable for assessing the same requirements of the operating divisions.},

abstract={The development of up-to-date industrial technology and improving efficiency can be achieved by operational control and management and by research and design. These three problems and the corresponding subproblems can be formulated, investigated, and solved on the basis of problem-oriented mathematical models. The general approach to the development of the problem-oriented models has several particular features that depend on the problems to be solved-knowledge and data about the systems to be modeled, demand for model accuracy, type of model solution (off-line or on-line), computer type, and so on. The results of implementing problem-oriented models to improve the efficiency of industrial technology is considered for the case of steelmaking in basic oxygen furnaces (BOF), which is the most widely used technology in the world. The problems that were formulated, the approaches to the development of the mathematical models, and the processes that occur in BOF technology are typical for other different kinds of industrial technology, such as chemicals, the cement industry, atomic reactors, and the glass industry. © 1978.},

At the outset a central servicing station should be established in backward areas not far from the market. The aim of the Scheme is to make the rural people conscious of the vast potentialities of the rural ceramic project. Any attempt to make the organization a showcase should be carefully avoided. It should be under the direct control of Govt. agencies preferably under the small-scale industries Directorate with representatives of financial institutions, elected representatives of the cottage unit holders, and representatives from All India Handi-craft Board, Khadi Board etc.},

The EFTS switch permits financial institutions to share customer terminal devices (for example, point-of-sale terminals in a supermarket) by transmitting messages generated at the terminal to the financial institutions holding the customer (and merchant) account. The switch, in addition to message routing, must maintain information for settlement among the financial institutions involved, and generate accounting, audit trial and operational reports. Specifically addressed in the paper are: the financial transactions and terminal devices involved; switch message processing and accounting functions; hardware, software, and network components and alternatives; and security and backup considerations. The material presented is based on EFTS project work performed by Technology Management Incorporated (TMI) for the Federal Home Loan Bank System. © 1976 ACM.},

abstract={Salinity as a mineral pollutant is receiving increased attention in the Western United States in terms of economic impacts. The salinity control problem on the Colorado River is examined in relation to the Federal Water Quality Act, PL 92-500. As such, it is concluded that even basinwide, salinity controls as presently envisioned will not be able to meet anticipated salinity standards and the 'zero discharge' goals of the Act. A new planning strategy of total water management is suggested to identify and evaluate water needs, water resources, physical technology, and other nonphysical constraints. Thus, the specific economic limitations and institutional constraints identified under the various management options will assist in setting attainable salinity levels within a river basin in lieu of meeting rigid zero discharge limitations for each water user.

Because of the increasing complexity, the higher standards, and the rising costs for medical equipment and facilities, the passive 'fix it if it is broken' approach must be replaced by an active 'prevent it from breaking' policy. Hospitals will need to make an active commitment to the management of rather than reaction to technology. A key person in this new approach will be the hospital engineer, who will move into 'management row' as a manager of technology. This article considers the forces behind the coming changes in the approach to technology, and the responsibilities of and the qualifications for the hospital engineer of the future.},

abstract={The innovation process is not homogeneous, but highly variable according to industrial sector and the level of abstraction of the innovation itself. This level of abstraction from existing products while not precisely measurable, can be graded, thus giving some guidance as to the probability of success according to the size of investment and the risk involved. The complexity of the new product and its technological level (the monograph confines the argument to product innovation) will also determine how the innovating organisation handles the innovation. Much research has now been done into the innovation process, and some of the leading projects and their findings are analysed. Supporting the basic argument there are two case histories, one of a successful scientific instrument, together with reference to an unsuccessful attempt to launch it, and one of a failure with a new material, in spite of highly successful technology. © 1974, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={At each successive stage in the R&D cycle leading to the commercialization of a new technology, management in any industry must reevaluate prospects and make decisions accordingly. However, for the steel industry the difficulties of this kind of decision-making throughout the usually lengthy R&D cycle are heightened by the very nature of the industry. For example, the large scale of its processes and the high capital costs for plants for new processes mean that the progressive scale-ups during a given development may themselves cost millions. From Bethlehem Steel's experience the author cites one new product and two major process developments to illustrate technical and economic considerations that enter into decision-making as R&D moves step by step toward the commercialization of new technology. © 1974.},

In order to develop an effective training program for the internal audit staff, the training program goals should be formally stated and presented to the internal audit staff. The goals should be stated in such a manner that staff members will adopt them as their own. Examples of goals are discussed. The funds and time devoted to internal audit training will yield a high return to management in the form of a competent internal audit staff which produces effective recommendations and a store of talent that can be called upon for special assignments and added responsibilities.},

abstract={Since 1966, the Indian Government has progressively restricted imports of technology. Together with constraints on the growth of big business houses and of foreign firms, the next consequence of the Government's policies has been that it takes 3-5 years for a large firm to get a sanction for the import of technology and its utilization; this entails advance planning of technology imports, and advance action for the generation of alternatives within the country, should the imports not be allowed. The restrictions on technology imports accentuated the need for internal research and development; at the same time, the recession that began in 1966, and whose effects still continue to be felt in some sectors, squeezed industrial profits and limited the resources that could be allocated to R & D. Hence large Indian firms have felt the need for methods of rational allocation of R & D resources among competing projects, and a number of them have been feeling their way towards general criteria of allocation. Some of their efforts are described here. They are essentially exploratory; but since R & D management is still a problematic area even in industrial countries, an analysis of Indian practices is perhaps of more general interest. © 1972.},

abstract={Engineers usually start their careers with intense technological training and as time goes on many of them move towards management, or marketing, or both. These three- technology, management and marketing- can be regarded as the three extremes, the work of most engineers lying somewhere between them. This suggests that the geography of engineering careers can be represented in a rough and ready manner by a triangle having technology, management and marketing as its three apexes.},

The ultimate fate of the steel industry is likely to depend largely on its success in evolving a total systems concept. This kind of approach is beginning to be used but it needs to be carried much farther, for the total system includes technology, management itself, organization of all parts of the enterprise and the financial aspects of the business.},
