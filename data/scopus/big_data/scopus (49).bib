abstract={Driven by the significant improvement of technologies and applications into smart manufacturing, this paper describes a way of analyzing and evaluating the quality of real-world industrial data. More precisely, it focuses on developing a method for determining the quality of production data and performing analysis of quality in terms of KPIs, such as OEE index and its sub-indicators, i.e. availability, quality rate and efficiency. The main purpose of the work is to propose a method that allows determine the quality of the data used to calculate production efficiency scores. In addition to the requirements imposed upon properly selected measures, we discuss possibilities of verifying the validity and reliability of these sub-indicators in relation to major production losses. The method for data quality assessment, developed in terms of the provided real data gathered from the factory shop-floor monitoring and management systems, was tested for its correctness. Our research has shown that an analysis of the quality of production data can reveal strengths and weaknesses in the production process. Finally, based on our single-unit intrinsic case study results, we discuss results learned on data quality assessment from an industry perspective and provide recommendations in this area. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to create applications to improve people’s quality of life using novel protocols, sensor networks, cloud computing, middlewares and other technologies. These applications can be used in several contexts such as industry, agriculture or smart cities. On university campuses, applications based on IoT can also be implemented. The applications can be focused on monitoring people’s behavior, smart buildings, or sustainable environments. Generally, IoT applications are not designed and developed in a standardized way. Besides that, university campuses do not have a platform to manage and deploy these applications easily. This work presents Smart UTB, an IoT platform designed by using the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) and focused in the management and deployment of IoT applications towards sustainability in a smart campus. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Currently, the seafood industry demands strict quality standards for the acceptance of products in international markets. In this context, rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is a pressing need in the fishing industry. In this sense, this work integrates the advances of information and communications technologies to facilitate the management of information on the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in sea products that reach a fishing port. For this, the proposed system integrates a series of low-cost biosensors with a distributed information architecture based on microservices. To achieve the results, initially, several pathogen bacteria detection systems were analyzed. Subsequently, both the relevant information variables were defined from a biogenic amines biosensor selected as the modes of operation of the proposed system. Then, the structure of the online information system and the characteristics of the interfaces were defined considering different types of users. To follow, a dynamic model was generated to show the evolution of the states of the system. Finally, the proposals were evaluated, showing the advantages from the functional, economic, and use potential uses. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The aging of the worldwide population has led to a growing prevalence of vascular diseases, negatively impacting national healthcare systems and patients. The application of information technologies in the health sector has the potential to allow the remote monitoring of patients and the personalization of healthcare. This work proposes the architecture for a remote monitoring platform that supports the self-management of vascular diseases in the context of the Inno4Health project, with the goal of stimulating the innovation in the continuous monitoring of the patients’ health. The platform aims to support health professionals and patients with vascular diseases through the continuous monitoring of their health condition and presentation of monitoring reports. Self-management tools will be provided to patients through the presentation of personalized recommendations adapted to their current health condition. By doing so, we believe it will be possible to improve the patients’ self-management of their disease as well as decrease the risk of disease-related complications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Electricity markets are complex and dynamic environments with very particular characteristics. Ambitious goals, including those set by the European Union, foster the increased use of distributed generation, essentially based on renewable energy sources. This requires major changes in electricity markets and energy systems, namely through the adoption of the smart grid paradigm. The use of simulation tools and the study of different market mechanisms and the relationships between their stakeholders are essential. One of the main challenges in this area is developing decision support tools to address the problem as a whole. This work contributes to increasing interoperability between heterogeneous systems, namely agent-based, directed to the study of electricity markets, the operation of smart grid, and energy management. To this end, this work proposes the use of ontologies to ease the interaction between entities of different natures and the use of semantic web technologies to develop more intelligent and flexible tools. A multiagent systems society, composed of several heterogeneous multiagent systems, which interact using the proposed ontologies, is presented as a proof-of-concept. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Society 5.0 seeks to resolve social and economic imbalances through the integration of the virtual world and the physical world. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic the need and possibilities hereof has become so much clearer. This paper aims to shed light on the factors affecting the adoption of virtual team collaboration within innovation driven companies, as their primary mode of knowledge transfer. By getting insight into these factors, we will be on our way to enable individuals, companies and governments to promote effective adoption of virtual team collaboration. This in turn can reduce the knowledge gap that exists in developing post-colonial countries, by enabling knowledge to be better transferred between industries within the country and from outside the country. This paper provides an in-depth coverage of the existing literature starting by looking into knowledge transfer as a management principle, then looking at the innovation of virtual team collaboration itself and finally at the social system, an innovation driven organisation, into which the innovation will be adopted. The findings are then applied to the Diffusion of Innovation theory’s Innovation-Decision Process. By understanding these key determinants, organisations may utilise this guidance in the application of virtual team collaboration (VTC) as a mode of knowledge transfer when considering innovation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={While interest in understanding the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real world has been growing, there is limited research on what digital transformation means in the banking sector. The present paper aims to address this gap in the literature by means of a field study based on 11 interviews with wealth managers from across front, middle and back offices in a large Swiss bank. Our analyses suggest bank employees have relatively positive attitudes toward the adoption of new technologies. According to the research, the top three advantages for adopting AI in wealth management are: efficiency, enhanced clients’ experience and better customer insight. Yet, AI also brings new challenges to banking. Obstacles identified include process complexity, greater maintenance effort, and increased regulatory requirements. Still, AI is expected to change the banking model to an integrated, hybrid and leaner operation with digital processes that offer front-to-back solutions. With respect to the future of the bank workforce, hiring tech-savvy talent will be crucial. AI will be able to free bank employees from repetitive jobs for more interesting and creative tasks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={An accounting course today has become an essential syllabus for social sciences students, particularly, in business, management, and entrepreneurship. Since social sciences students are not purely accounting students, learning accounting is proven to be more challenging for them and innovations for the course, including the methods used in teaching the accounting course. This study aims to develop a Future Ready Accounting Course (FRAC) for non-accounting students by using simple augmented reality technology, embedded into the course’s teaching and learning method. This study examines the non-accounting students’ experiences of applying FRAC in their accounting courses. By using a mixed method approach, questionnaire surveys were conducted to examine the students’ experiences towards FRAC revolving three elements of the course, lecturers, and infrastructures or facilities. Since the lecturer teaching FRAC composed one member of the research team, a field observation also carried out to monitor the FRAC’s implementation. The results of the study reveal an evidence that an accounting course can indeed be taught in more innovative and attractive ways. In other words, accounting departments would do well to consider the novel contribution made by this study by adopting FRAC to replace the old-fashioned conventional accounting courses. It is noted that the non-accounting students employed in this study were able to feel a new experience in learning an accounting course with the adoption of FRAC. This significantly concludes that FRAC can successfully attract and help non-accounting students to excel in their accounting courses to fulfil the requirements of their degrees. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The increasing complexity of modern production processes necessitates the use of artificial intelligence technologies that use formalized knowledge to develop effective management tools. It is proposed to use the well-known Balance Score Card System to describe production processes based on the concepts of risks. The key performance indicators of the Balanced Scorecard are organized in a tree graph. The root of the tree graph is an event that causes a security violation. The rest of the graph vertices are unfavourable events. The branches of the tree describe the causal mechanisms between these events. A mathematical model is proposed to describe action and reaction in the form of a matrix. Its cells are functions that describe interactions at the nodes of the tree. If the result of the interaction contributes to the occurrence of an event that should be considered as unfavourable, then the sign of the event is positive. If the interaction led to the elimination of the adverse event, then the event result is zero. It is assumed that interactions can backfire and facilitate processes to prevent adverse events. The probability of realization of each combination depends on the result of interactions at the vertices of the graph, which are described by status functions. Status functions can be viewed as an extended analogy to probabilities. To develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of production processes, improve the quality and safety of food products, a system of linear differential equations of Kolmogorov-Chapman is used. The described results are obtained by solving linear differential equations. They allow you to develop scenarios and predict the dynamics of production processes when solving automation problems to improve the quality and safety of the food industry. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The dialectical approach to the knowledge representation in general form consists in the possibility of synthesizing new knowledge based on the explication of meaningful contradictions in the antinomic poles of dichotomies. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the fact that the dialectical approach is combined with new information technologies. This is how the “bridge” of reasoning is thrown from the concept of “knowledge management” to machine learning based on large, expertly labeled data. This is the basis of the synthesis carried out in the expert-metric approach, which is a special case of the dialectical approach. Now, with the development of the Internet, big data, there is a technological opportunity to use the creative potential of dialectics more fully. The basis of the synthesis depth is the representation of the management decision-making process by a set of decision trees. In this case, the metric approach is the use of a small number of decision trees, often presented explicitly, and the expert approach is the use of a very large number of trees that exist only in the head of an expert in an implicit, non-reflected form. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the introduction of Federal Law No. 187 [1], methodological issues of ensuring information security of processes, systems, and technologies were updated. The introduced regulatory documents regulate these issues without taking into account a systematic approach. In addition, the assessment of information security (IS) of the subject of critical information infrastructure (SCII) does not take into account infrastructure destructive, the appearance of which is possible due to inter-object systems of relationships and interactions at the level of the subject of CII. SCII is a complex multi-component dynamic system. In a number of works, cognitive modeling and a scenario approach were used to justify and implement a comprehensive assessment of information security. To ensure its safety, it is necessary to make management decisions. For the development of the information security management system, it is proposed to use proactive modeling. As one of the indicators of the effectiveness of proactive management at the level of ensuring the safety of SCII, we can consider the coefficient of structural functionality of the SCII. To evaluate this indicator, we propose a developed model and a methodology for working with it. Expected indicators of the competitive advantages of the using of proactive security management of the SCII: stabilization of the processes of ensuring the security of the SCII at all stages of the life cycle, reduction of the costs of ensuring the security of the components of the SCII, including in the dynamic model. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper describes self-evaluation of online course of “Introduction to cultural studies” during quarantine period in public university of Mongolia. Due to the Covid-19, pandemic situation, and the teaching style had to switch from traditional classroom teaching to online teaching without any preparation. This action happened in many countries and the teaching faculties met with challenges which had to be solved. The Mongolian University of Science and Technology has its own learning management system Unimis for e-learning, but due to the massive access of all students and professors to system some weaknesses of the system were found. The Unimis was not able to handle all requests from teaching faculties therefore professors heeded to use other software for teaching, such as Zoom, Microsoft Team, Moodle and others for instance. Issues of online teaching are divided into three main parts. First is the teaching environment like learning management system, different software for preparation of digital content; second is readiness of professors and last not least is readiness of students for e-learning. The self-evaluation of “Introduction to cultural studies” online course is aimed to figure out second and third issues of e-learning during pandemic. Findings from evaluation will apply for improvement of online course for further teaching. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The article deals with the synthesis of tools for optimizing the process of training specialists in an intellectual educational environment. The complex of tools is being developed in a hyper-converged computing ecosystem to support open personalized learning technologies. The complex is necessary to update the training programs for specialists and content in accordance with the changing requirements of federal educational standards and the requirements of employers in labor markets. The developed tools search, collect, consolidate and intelligent analyze the requirements for specialists, which can be found in Internet sources, for example, on the websites of enterprises or recruiting agencies, as well as in the corresponding sections of social networks and messengers. At the next stage, the process of setting up and synchronizing educational programs is implemented, taking into account the consolidated information and predicted data on the required competencies in the short and medium term in the region. Setting up the educational process in the information environment takes place in a convergent learning model by updating educational programs and personalizing the trajectories of training specialists. The convergent model determines the convergence of educational programs and content for different specialties in accordance with the processes of digitalization of all spheres of human life, which is reflected in the requirements for competencies in professional and educational standards on the part of employers. The processes of actualization and personalization make it possible to increase the efficiency and quality of training specialists by reducing the risks of obtaining a low-quality and morally outdated education.

abstract={Online teaching is gradually spreading widely, but there are problems in online teaching evaluation, such as lack of reference index, students’ learning state feedback being hard to get in real-time. To improve online teaching quality and evaluation, a classroom behavior analysis and evaluation system based on deep learning face recognition technology is proposed. This system conducts the model training and tests on the deep learning development framework (TensorFlow). It implements the frame image processing through the Mask R-CNN network, extracts the skeleton and the angle direction information to establish the vector, thus carries out the classroom behavior recognition and analysis, and serves as the appraisal important index. The behavior analysis is made and the results show that the recognition rate is high and the learning situation feedback is given in real time. The experiment shows that the system has certain robustness and high accuracy in the real scene. It is convenient for classroom teaching management and implementation, and is helpful to improve the teaching quality. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the continuous development of network technology, the number of streaming media videos is growing rapidly. More and more users are watching videos through the Internet, which leads to the increasing huge server load and the increasing transmission cost across ISP domains. A feasible scheme to reduce transmission cost across ISP domains and alleviate the server load is to cache some popular videos in a large number of terminal users. Therefore, in this paper, in order to utilize the idle resources of the terminal peers, some peers with good performance were selected from the fixed peers as the super peers, which were aggregated into a super peer set (SPS). In addition, with the supply and demand relation of streaming videos among ISP domains, a mathematical model was formulated to optimize the service utility of ISP. Then, a collaborative cache strategy was proposed based on the utility optimization. The simulation results show that the strategy proposed can effectively improve the user playback fluency and hit rate while ensuring the optimal service utility. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the closer integration of database and machine learning, machine learning task in database can reduce the data transmission, thus dramatically boosting the runtime performance of the whole task. Moreover, if there is a chance of storing machine learning models involved in similar tasks in the system intelligently, the computation resource and time cost of repeated training will be greatly reduced. However, the intelligent storage system of machine learning model has not been developed yet. In order to achieve this goal, a method is proposed to measure the similarity of machine learning tasks. Second, the intelligent storage system of machine learning model was designed to manage models. Finally, it introduced the overall architecture and key technologies of intelligent storage system of machine learning model based on task similarity (ISSMLM), and describe three demonstration scenarios of the system. The results show the validity of the proposed method. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={During the last decade, blockchain technology has gained massive attention due to its decentralized, transparent, and verifiable features. However, data stored on the blockchain is publicly available, immutable, and may link to the data owner, thus making privacy management and data modification major challenges. In this paper, we present a RESTful decentralized storage framework that provides data privacy and mutability. To do so, it combines blockchain with distributed hash table, role-based access control, ring signature, and multiple encryption mechanisms. We designed a protocol that exploits metadata and pointers stored on the blockchain, while corresponding encrypted data are stored off-chain, so that data owners are able to control their data. Each peer in our framework offers RESTful APIs to operate, thus ensuring interoperability over the Web. In this paper, we present the operation of our framework and its components that enable data protection at run-time. We also evaluate its performance with time measurements from our proof-of-concept implementation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Remote health monitoring is a trend for better health management which necessitates the need for secure monitoring and privacy-preservation of patient data. Moreover, accurate and continuous monitoring of personal health status may require expert validation in an active learning strategy. As a result, this paper proposes a Federated Interactive Learning IoT-based Health Monitoring Platform (FIL-IoT-HMP) which incorporates multi-expert feedback as ‘Human-in-the-loop’ in an active learning strategy in order to improve the clients’ Machine Learning (ML) models. The authors have proposed an architecture and conducted an experiment as a proof of concept. Federated learning approach has been preferred in this context given that it strengthens privacy by allowing the global model to be trained while sensitive data is retained at the local edge nodes. Also, each model’s accuracy is improved while privacy and security of data has been upheld. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This research investigates software engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the lessons learned and predictions for future software engineering work. Four themes are explored: Remote work, Team management, Work/Life balance, and Technology/Software Engineering Methods. Our research has demonstrated that software companies will derive tangible benefits from supporting their employees during this uncertain time through ergonomic home offices, listening to their concerns, as well as encouraging breaks and hard stops to boost long term well-being and productivity. It shows that communication and collaboration tools, critical to project success, have been utilised. The hiring of new talent has been reimagined, with managers playing a vital role in the process. The insights gained are significant as they will assuage some pre-existing concerns regarding remote work, creating a new understanding of its role in the future. Looking to a post-COVID-19 future, we envision the rise of hybrid software development working arrangements, with a focus on the Working-From-Home to Not-Working-From-Home ratio - WFH: NWFH - perhaps colloquialised as Home: Not Home (HNH). For many this ratio will be neither 100:0 or 0:100, the former would lead to team breakdowns, developer isolation, difficulties onboarding and too many communication gaps, the latter would lead to disaffected employees. We identify plausible future software engineering working arrangements, noting that there are challenging times ahead for employers and employees as they navigate this HNH future, but there are benefits for both parties in getting the balance right. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to introduce new competencies at the interface between corporate strategy and managing innovation in the automotive industry as strategic perspectives shift from a one-dimensional thinking in technology to a two-dimensional thinking in systems and business designs. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the trends in business designs and the way to get there. This requires an innovation agent with the competencies to translate the findings into suitable actions. We extend the principles of the SPI manifesto in the context of a learning organization, dynamic models, and focus. The question of how to strategically evaluate innovation projects of an automotive tier 1 supplier is addressed by the analysis of qualitative interviews in a single case organization. For this purpose, the model of the Innovation Landscape Map is used, which represents the initial situation of the innovation projects of a company on its technical competencies and the business model. This internal view is then extended by an external perspective of megatrends and external interviewees to counteract purely corporate thinking and provide a more holistic view. The results show gaps between the desired allocation and the actual allocation, as well as internal and external views. Finally, in a self-reflection it is determined which possible competencies are necessary for an innovation agent in the implementation of a new tool in innovation management. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In modern economic conditions, the issue of development and stable activity of each company is relevant. Many companies interact with clients on the sale of goods, products, services. To increase the customer base and its retention, it is necessary to use modern digital technologies. The most popular and affordable for small companies are network and mobile technologies. In this work, a preliminary project has been developed for automating the business process of interacting with clients of the company for the development and implementation of software. A preliminary analysis of the company’s activities and the automated business process showed that the implementation of a Bitrix24-based CRM system is required. In this regard, a description of the project for the implementation of a CRM system has been prepared, reflecting the advantages of automating interaction with customers. Also, a preliminary calendar plan has been developed, consisting of four stages and a complex of subtasks. A preliminary assessment of the amount of investment for the implementation of the project has been carried out. The implementation of the proposed project will optimize the work of client managers, reduce the number of errors, make the interaction between clients more transparent, and optimize the interaction between employees and departments. Automation of interaction with customers of the company will allow in the future to reduce current costs and increase net profit. The proposed project is universal for different companies and, after making the necessary adjustments, can be used with other initial data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and related new technologies have been widely discussed in recent years, especially on its benefits and threats to society. This study aims to explore the impact of AI on work and human value at different levels of AI capability. Adopting a qualitative approach, we conducted a focus group discussion with six scholars who have AI research experience in different social disciplines and in various global regions. Four main topics were discussed in the focus group, which are: (1) attitude toward AI, (2) types of businesses, industries, or workers that benefit or are threatened the most by AI, (3) willingness to work with a robot with different levels of intelligence, and (4) how to find human’s value and get prepared for future workplace. The discussion was recorded under the consent of participants and transcribed verbatim. ATLAS.ti version 8 software was used for the textual data analysis. The findings reveal that scholars: (1) are optimistic toward AI in general, (2) believe that most industries will benefit from AI, (3) are divided in attitude toward robots with empathetic intelligence, (4) argue that humans need to get prepared for the future workplace.

abstract={Quality tools allow improving health attention processes. Benchmarking is an effective tool because allows recognize success key factors to be replied in a specific sector. The sterilization department is the area in charge of reprocessing the necessary supplies for the care of patients in the institutions providing health services, hence good practices are important in this sector to guarantee patient safety and efficiency in the hospital service provision. This investigation pretends to identify success key factors and high quality in eight sterilization departments in Colombia, from a comparative study. A multiple case study was carried out in recognized sterilization departments, with the application of a comparative evaluation tool based on AAMI and adjusted to the objectives, highlighting quality management, human talent management, information management and technology and process management. Results show the sterilization departments adaptation in quality management, human talent management, information and technology management and process management. Sterilization departments in Colombia are adapting to the quality requirements of the environment, adjusting the operation to be cost-effective and consistent with the reality of the country. Leaders have a challenge to manage with quality and efficiency, although there is still progress in technological development and provide greater resources to the sector, the quality of the process and patient safety are guaranteed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The participation of citizens to solve public challenges is a driver to implement public innovation. Addressing new mechanisms and arenas that facilitate citizen participation is one of the challenges on the governments’ agenda, especially under changing, complex and social distancing scenarios such as those caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Therefore, digital platforms that promote co-creation between citizens, governments, and other actors in the countries’ innovation ecosystems, are becoming more and more necessary, but at the same time, there is a need to study their scope and contributions to generate transparent, equitable, inclusive and people-centered citizen participation processes. Indeed, the research aim was to make a trend analysis on the field integrating two methods: a literature review about concepts related to public innovation platforms: co-creation and citizen participation; and finally, a web content analysis on three platforms that generated co-creation exercises to solve challenges in the Covid-19 Pandemic. The main results show the need to study the challenges and contributions of digital platforms to make public innovation the result of a collaborative effort that goes beyond the ideation stages to implement solutions and generate public value. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Augmented Reality is an emerging technology and gains in importance. With AR, the physical world can be extended with virtual content. Especially AR-applications for industrial maintenance are experiencing an upswing. AR-technologies for maintenance aim to improve human performance by providing relevant information for a specific task. This information can be provided by sensor data from machines, software systems, or human experts. Currently, there are not many industry-ready AR-applications on the market. This lack raises the question if AR-applications can effectively support service staff in the field. An experimental investigation was carried out to explore this field. Two industrial maintenance cases with different levels of difficulty were simulated, whereby service staff had to solve these real-life problems. Support from an expert was provided via an AR-application. In addition, the Affinity for Technology Interaction score was assessed in order to identify the target group for AR-applications. The results clearly show that AR-applications can effectively support service staff in the field. The research also reveals that a high Affinity for Technology Interaction score of the service technician leads to a higher acceptance of the AR-application. The application offers many potentials, but there are still some limitations concerning the user interface and technological aspects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper aims at clarifying actors, associations and treatment flow that patient, caregiver and healthcare professional undergo; at identifying shared contexts (“ba”) and their overlap for self-transcendence; at looking at the actors and associations as activity systems to understand the activities and actions executed, and expected to be executed, by the actors (division of labor) to visualize boundaries for transformation. Qualitative data was gathered through open-ended questionnaires distributed to healthcare professionals and caregivers in Japan, Singapore and Brazil. Hermeneutic analysis and interpretation of the answers were conducted to draw findings and implications; data generated from these went through framework method of analysis in three levels: Actor-Network Theory to identify actors, associations and treatment flow; Knowledge-Creation Theory’s shared context; as activity systems to clarify the division of labor. Three actors were found: patient, healthcare professional, and caregiver. The consultation is central to treatment flow as it is when one shared context emerges among actors, assessment is conducted, and tasks are assigned. This is a preliminary study which lays the foundation for our ongoing research, so the implications are targeted at the researchers: necessity to clarify what sort of negotiations and translations usually take and the role of technology in it; identify where and how actors become attuned to focus on where and how self-transcendence happens; understand actions to visualize boundaries for transformation. This is a first attempt to analyze patient-healthcare professional-caregiver relationship combining the Actor-Network Theory, “ba” and Activity Theory’s division of labor. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Innovation ability is the core competitiveness of science and technology enterprises. Regular monitoring and evaluation of enterprise innovation capabilities can help management departments accurately grasp the enterprise’s research and development (R&D) and market expansion capabilities, and help enterprises understand their own development potential. Referring to relevant national science and technology innovation enterprise evaluation standards, an innovation index evaluation system was established for science and technology innovation enterprises. In this paper, the innovation capability of science and technology enterprises was modeled and evaluated from the point of view of medical device companies. It made use of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation on enterprise innovation capability, used relatively objective entropy method to determine weight, and applied weighted geometric mean method to further optimize the weight value of wide-ranging data. Thus, it ensured the scientificity and stability of the weight value. In order to verify the rationality and correntness of our model, 218 representative science and technology enterprises in the medical machinery industry were selected as evaluation samples. Based on entropy method, their respective index weights were determined, while their innovation capabilities in the industry were evaluated comprehensively. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The last decade has seen an uptake of Artificial Intelligence technology in many fields. In particular, we have witnessed the proliferation of so-called Expert Systems (i.e., algorithm-based recommender engines), which are increasingly used to support decision making processes. To this end, trust in technology plays a significant role, as without such people are unwilling to rely on this type of tool support. The goal of the research presented in this paper was thus to investigate said trust in ‘expert system advice’ when received in the context of a business ethics audit. We report on the results of a scenario-focused survey aimed at understanding people’s preference for an advice giver, and whether such is connected to their general trust behavior, as well as their affinity for technology. Results show that participants’ willingness to depend on machine advice is approximately similar to their willingness to depend on human advice, the trust they put into the artificial advice giver, however, increases with their affinity for technology. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The level of overcrowding of hospitals and health care centers in Colombia and especially in the cities far away from the main capitals has had an increase in recent years, this problem generates a constant and growing discomfort in the Colombian population due to the delayed or lack of provision of various medical services and access difficulties, especially in remote areas. With the aim of providing health centers with tools to make virtual appointments and avoid overcrowding of patients who do not need to go to hospitals due the characteristics of their illness and also to improve the implementation of technologies in the Colombian health system, we propose a framework to develop telemonitoring platforms with dynamic processing capabilities. The tests are carried out using cloud computing and free programming tools. Through the tests carried out on the proposed modeling, we determined that it can be implemented in a simple, fast and easy way. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In Japan, esco business has been attracting attention rapidly since 1996, and it has been adopted by companies in various fields and has achieved great results. In order to guarantee energy-saving effects, esco business enters into performance agreements (success compensation agreements) between ESCO operators and customers; Hitachi’s HDRIVE is a high-efficiency motor, high-voltage inverter, and monitoring sys-tem.equipment to the customer’s factory for free, and the energy saving benefits obtained by operating the equipment at a certain rate, It is a solution business to collect as HDRIVE usage fee. Unlike the conventional idea of product sales business, it is to sell the energy saving of the product in the form of a service. Because it is a payment from the merit amount by the energy effect, Monthly payments vary.Customers can introduce new equipment withno initial costs, and can save energy and reduce costs.

abstract={Knowledge is important to the extent it is used. This knowledge use assumes that people know about findings resulting from the investigations that generate it. Production and mobilization of knowledge are not new, nevertheless, such production and mobilization have occurred in developed countries from works and products research. In Colombia, in accordance with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, 5.772 groups of investigation are recognized by different institutions, and 16.799 researchers. The purpose of this article is to determine what are the means used by researchers in Colombia, to disseminate the results of their investigations. The methodology incorporates primary data, through a validated instrument by experts. Those results confirm that Colombian researchers still use traditional means to spread out such results. Very few of them use the emerging Information and Communication Technology for that purpose. Thus, an opportunity emerges for Researchers regarding the use of ICT in knowledge mobilization. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Colombian Swine Industry (CSI) has a global importance in agriculture as a sustainable objective worldwide, and it is very attractive for farmers for its short productive cycle, if it is compared to other business lines. Thus, the CSI seeks to encourage profitability, to minimize production cost, to open new markets, and to supply local demand. Therefore, they need to search tools for measuring its key indicators. They have important constrains, for instance the lack of technology, economic benefits, and human resources training. With the above, the article objective is to identify pig producers’ key indicators which could carry to create and share knowledge management. Pig industry key indicators were extracted from the literature. After that, those indicators were contrasted by 19 companies using a Likert scale; then, those were analyzed and grouped according to the Balance Scorecard perspectives using the main component analysis. Finally, a measuring instrument was designed, it was validated by 15 CSI experts, who then applied it to a representative sample of 62 companies in the agricultural sector. Among the most outstanding results were the list of pig industry key indicators and its validation, its importance and measurement level; CSI sustainable indexes inclusion from literature; knowledge creation in pig farmers using indexes for measuring and making decisions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The current business environment is dynamic, and organizations’ learning capability is critical. In order to gain sustainable competitive advantage, a company’s organizational knowledge base must be well protected and cultivated, and it must be shared among its employees. Knowledge management (KM) has become critical for the success of every organization. Importantly, KM is more than information technology and is not just a technical concept. Building on previous studies of KM and organizational performance, the paper provides a framework for investigating the relationship between a company’s KM strategy and its business sustainability. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Currently, data quality is in the spotlight of research and organizations. It derives from new technological developments, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which provides unprecedented amounts of data and enables new ways of creating knowledge. The interim value is hidden in the flood of data and has already received many industries such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. These organizations adopt data applications to extract critical information to understandits purpose better, leading to a competitive advantage. In parallel to gain these positive effects based on struggling around with the data, the quality of data and the decisions are neglected very often. Decisions must be made quickly in response to changing requirements. Thereby, agile methods and approaches can be successfully and profitably applied. The decisive factor for success is the holistic view of architecture, organization, technology, and adapted process models. Due to the given ideas, research on data quality combined with agile companies is still in its infancy. This paper presents categories for data quality in combination agility based on literature and expert interviews to close this gap and establish a foundation for future research. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and related new technologies have received a lot of attention from the public. In Taiwan, the government and enterprises are also making efforts to develop these technologies. Against this backdrop, and with the massive unemployment that resulted from automation in the third industrial revolution, human workers are anxious about their jobs being replaced by smart robots. On the contrary, many scholars hold a positive view and suggest that technologies augment and enhance human capabilities. Therefore, in order to better understand the present situation in Taiwan, this research was designed to explore the relationship of AI and jobs by adopting a qualitative approach for data collection. Two sessions of focus group discussion were conducted with eight practitioners from different industries, in addition to three in-depth interviews with executive-level managers. All participants have rich knowledge and experience in AI development or implementation. The discussions mainly focused on: (1) examples of the impact of AI and related new technologies on the labor market, (2) the competency of future talents, and (3) suggestions for policymakers. The discussions were recorded with the consent of the participants and transcribed into textual data for further analysis. The research adopted ATLAS.ti version 8 for data analysis. The findings revealed: (1) most practitioners consider AI as a tool; (2) task replacement does happen but workers gain more benefits; (3) new jobs are created as technologies are being developed and utilized. Most participants hold an affirmative attitude toward AI and new technologies. Suggestions for the government and organizations have also been discussed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={At present, more and more vocational colleges set up the etiquette course. In traditional etiquette education, due to the shortage of teachers, it is not practicable to effectively manage students. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a method based on posture recognition technology and using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the similarity of etiquette action. This method can be used in action video teaching, used for individual teaching. The student can carry out real-time learning or evaluation of the etiquette action, and be given guidance, thus his resources can be accumulated in the process, so that the teacher can scientifically manage students’ knowledge. The research found that the proposed method can automatically match standard and test keyframe, and can calculate similarity for skeletons of different body sizes. By comparing the similarity of different postures, the consequence shows that the method is more feasible than the European distance. This method can be used not only for etiquette action teaching, but also for the other field of action teaching. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In recent years, Guangdong Province has made remarkable achievements in implementing the work of openness in government affairs, which has been rated as excellent in the evaluation. The digital government reform and construction of Guangdong Province also promotes the deep integration of government affairs openness and government services. However, for people from overseas, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and foreign nationals or enterprises, there is no perfect service system and mechanism, which undoubtedly becomes one of the obstacles to the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and is not conducive to the efficient development of the Greater Bay Area. At present, there is a gap in the bibliometric analysis of this topic. In this paper, 908 articles were retrieved from the Web of Science database, and the cited literatures on “e-government”, “management”, “social Science”, “business economy”, “Science and technology” were reviewed. With the use of big data analysis technology and visualization software, the author’s key words, major research institutions, countries and sources of publications are analyzed in detail, revealing the current situation related to the work of government affairs openness, so as to provide a more complete picture. To a certain extent, it will promote the improvement of the government service level and ability of Guangdong Province as a first-tier city and region with close exchanges with overseas compatriots and foreign friends, and encourage it to absorb more talents. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Service-learning conjoins academic study with community service and provides a richer, more practical experience for students, while benefitting the community. Students are required to transform their prior knowledge or generate new knowledge through experience into competencies and operational know-how. However, current research indicates concerns such as transfer of homogenous, theoretical-based knowledge only and a low adoption of project-based learning activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to design a knowledge operationalisation model for service learning in community projects at a higher education institution (HEI). We applied the model in a service-learning module from an HEI using the elements of the model as guide to identify knowledge operationalisation mechanisms. By using the knowledge operationalisation model, service learning may support the effective transformation of knowledge that students can access and apply. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Handover management has been considered major factors showing the effectiveness of each wireless network technology. In this paper, the research has considered the role of fuzzy-logic tactics and Q-learning in decision making for handover margin. The optimization technique PSO has to provide an optimized solution during HOM. The optimized HOM performance, A3-based traditional scheme, and A2-A4-RSRQ handover algorithm are discussed based on user speed and traffic load parameters. An issue is that traditional researches have not focused on optimization mechanism to optimize user speed and traffic load. Such models were unable to optimize variable user speeds as well as dynamic traffic loads. An efficient optimizer is required to reduce the call drop rates and increase system throughputs. It is required to integrate a PSO mechanism during HOM to optimize performance to reduce the call drop rate. The research work also concludes the best approach for handover in LTE Network. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Optimising the public procurement process through digitalisation has many benefits. In this regard, text mining and emerging technologies used to create intelligent indicators could potentially be applied throughout the public procurement process. Research is showing that these technologies are not yet firmly established in the public procurement process. However, as presented in this paper, they have the potential to transform this process in various ways, and there is a considerable scope as to how this could be achieved. This paper provides insight into the research and corresponding activities of research teams to establish a prototype of a national public procurement monitoring system that can be used as support for policy makers and for educational purposes, to provide best practices, and/or to improve transparency. As part of our research, we created a system that uses text mining techniques to analyse collected data for more than 60.000 cases over 5 years and use that data sample to identify a total of 56 indicator rules. As addition, lessons learned during the research process were used to propose phase-based development system guidelines and infrastructure planning and management. In the final part, several interesting results are presented as showcases that represent potential usability and the ease of use of the system. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays scientific data should be FAIR that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Reference implementation of FAIR data management principles proposed recently considers RDF as unifying data model and RDF Mapping Language (RML) as the basic language for data integration. This paper is aimed at development of methods and tools for scalable data integration in the frame of this architecture. A mapping from RML into a high-level data analysis language Pig Latin that runs on Hadoop is considered. The mapping is implemented using model transformation technologies. These allows to execute RML programs in the Hadoop distributed computing environment. According to the experimental evaluation RML implementation developed scales w.r.t. data volume and outperforms related implementations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of a set of indicators to measure knowledge management in the process research mission to the University; which attempt to demonstrate continuous improvement. From the exploratory method is able to determine the theoretical foundations and case studies to have a view of the applicability of knowledge management in the evaluation of research in the University, with emphasis on establishing the state of maturity of this process. The target population was selected to evaluate the indicators and is composed by a group of active members of the academic community, including teachers, Researchers, students, members of seed research and administrative staff Who are Involved in the area of research. Obtained results describe the external and the internal facilitators, achieved by indicators and measurement as a basis for evaluating creating a model of knowledge management processes for storage, processing and transfer of knowledge in research at the university. Importantly, do not need a large investment in resources (technology, infrastructure, etc.), for the implementation of the indicators, due to the existence of established techniques in the research. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Modern digital artefacts not only affect the way we work but increasingly also the way we learn and teach. The Internet, smart devices, as well as innovative forms of human-content interaction open up new pathways for successful knowledge transfer. The work presented in this paper aims to explore one of these recent developments, i.e. the use of Augmented Reality in school learning. We report on an experimental study in which two cohorts of secondary school students used a smartphone-based AR mobile-app to learn about astronomy and the solar system. The goal of the experiment was to evaluate the app’s perceived usability and task load associated with a set of particular learning exercises. Results point to an average perceived usability and moderate task load, independent of the students’ gender. Further, we found a negative correlation between the perceived usability and task load, even though this was only significant for male students. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Pragmatic interoperability between platforms and service-oriented architectures exists whenever there is an agreement on the roles of participants and components as well as minimum standards for good practice. In this work, it is argued that open platforms require pragmatic interoperability, complementing syntactic interoperability (e.g., through common file formats), and semantic interoperability by ontologies that provide agreed definitions for entities and relations. For consistent data management and the provision of services in computational molecular engineering, community-governed agreements on pragmatics need to be established and formalized. For this purpose, if ontology-based semantic interoperability is already present, the same ontologies can be used. This is illustrated here by the role of the “translator” and procedural definitions for the process of “translation” in materials modelling, which refers to mapping industrial research and development problems onto solutions by modelling and simulation. For associated roles and processes, substantial previous standardization efforts have been carried out by the European Materials Modelling Council (EMMC ASBL). In the present work, the Materials Modelling Translation Ontology (MMTO) is introduced, and it is discussed how the MMTO can contribute to formalizing the pragmatic interoperability standards developed by EMMC ASBL. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={For thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) ensured the health of the Chinese people in the most convenient way and at the lowest cost. TCM has formed a set of health management methods for preventing and controlling diseases. Contents of TCM health management include body constitution (BC) identification, disease prevention and treatment of TCM. The TCM health management system is a system that uses TCM’s theory to intelligently identify health status and provide intervention suggestions. The TCM health management system cannot fully reflect the concepts and methods of TCM health management. This study designed a framework of TCM health management system. This system framework is designed from the perspective of TCM logic rather than technology. The designed system integrates BC identification, disease prevention and treatment of TCM, forming a logical chain of TCM health management. In China, TCM is an important part of the medical system. Therefore, the TCM health management system in line with the logic of TCM is expected to become a valuable supplement to the modern medical health management system. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Stress-related diseases such as depression, anxiety and cardiovascular diseases are one of the main causes for sick leaves in older employees, aged 55+, in Europe. Mental disorders and work-related depression cost up to € 620 billion annually. mHealthINX seeks to alleviate these problems by providing a user-friendly solution that supports older employees in promoting and strengthening their mental health. It consists of (a) a hand-held stress-measurement device, (b) a mobile app that provides personalized interventions and enables the user to assess and elaborate the personal stress level via questionnaires and self-reported assessments and, (c) Virtual Reality (VR) glasses that offer immersive interventions where the user can blank out the stressful work-environment. VR is a promising technology that can offer innovative and immersive mental health interventions within a relaxing virtual environment. Users can choose their own relaxing surrounding to walk around and learn to cope with stressful situations via interventions like mindful relaxations and relaxing games. This provides an innovative way to support the user in coping with occupational stress. The provided interventions can be performed both during the work time and within a more private setting at home. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The elderly population in need of long-term care is rising, adding to the workload of healthcare workers in nursing homes. Throughout a work day health workers often must perform the time consuming process of collecting various types of health data from the residents. A recent study has revealed that frontline nurses and caregivers spend over half of their time accessing and updating patient records instead of providing care. New technology could enhance these data-oriented operations, and free up time so that staff can care for patients in other ways. Intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms can enhance data retrieval, visualization, and communication processes efficiently in a way to improve the overall productivity during work. In this study, we present an intelligent holographic mixed reality (MR) system that leverages Microsoft Hololens for work practices of healthcare work in nursing homes. Supported by computer vision, this system provides automatic data retrieval, in addition to interactive data visualization and mid-air data entry mechanism. Using face recognition through the Hololens’ visual sensors, the system recognizes individual patients, and automatically retrieves relevant health data and supports data entry. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={At the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 was wreaking havoc around the world, exposing a serious imbalance in the distribution of healthcare resources. In addition, the proportion of people with sub-health and chronic diseases is increasing, the population aging is serious, and the low utilization rate of public medical resources is also a topic of increasing attention in recent years. Most countries and regions have realized the importance of disease prevention. Smart medical system relies on artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, cloud computing, virtual reality and many other modern technologies. The development of 5G technology has laid a foundation for the rapid development of these technologies. As part of smart medicine based on 5G technology, smart health management emphasizes helping people build a healthy lifestyle before they get sick. This kind of health management is based on a variety of modern science and technology, the collection of user information, the establishment of information database, data mining and analysis, the establishment of the user’s personal health file, and for different users to provide thousands of health advice. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Organizations have found a great ally in information technologies to achieve success in their management processes. For universities, for example, information systems and platforms are essential to support the academic and administrative management of their institutional mission. These platforms, whether proprietary or licensed, serve institutions not only as a data repository but also as a scenario for managing and systematizing processes and procedures. The Pascual Bravo University Institution in Medellín, Colombia, has articulated its academic management processes through the University Academic Information and Control System or SICAU (in its Spanish acronym) platform, a proprietary development that perhaps has not achieved a coherent integration between information architecture and interface design. That is, the information experience specified in the backend (data architecture) is not integrated or reflected in the experience of the different users in the frontend (interface design). The objective of this case study is to propose the design of the interface level interaction (graphic elements and feedback) for the SICAU platform in the teaching module at the Pascual Bravo University Institution. It is concluded that the analysis on action maps allows to identify gaps on the information architecture. The interaction analysis model proposed in this research facilitated the design of interactions with the purpose of improving the user experience (UX) and attributes in the platform’s backend. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={As a result of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, museums around the world have closed their physical doors, but some of them have opened digital windows to be able to visit them through virtual tours. Through them, interactive and sensory experiences are created developing educational and training spaces, which constitute pedagogical mediators that help teachers make their virtual classes more innovative, creating the interest of their students. This article describes the interactive museums as pedagogical mediators that propose a fusion of knowledge and new experiences, which transport the student to a cultural environment fostering the interest of interacting, knowing and visiting museums; in this way they can renew and create new interactive and innovative experiences. Through interactive museums, it is intended to promote a different learning dynamic, and at the same time improve the student’s disposition to receive new knowledge. This proposal contributes to the teaching-learning process with the use of innovative, interactive teaching resources that are at the same time consistent with the current environment in which children grow up. It is relevant to be able to encourage teachers to apply new educational strategies supported by technology, and thereby enrich their teaching management, achieve better teaching results with their students and seek other interrelationships. The study is also consistent and timely with current times, as teachers and students continue to interact in a virtual mode. The study delves into interactive museums and investigates the type of digital resources that can support the teaching-learning process in the area of Sciences. These ideas are intended to contribute to the design of innovative teaching resources that are based on the experiences of virtual visits to interactive museums, through which it is possible to take advantage of all the advantages and benefits they offer. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The use of Mixed Reality (MR) technologies is expected to address the current challenges in mining engineering education. Including hands-on experience often conflicts with limited resources for field trips and excursions. Various studies report that MR can support students in fostering knowledge transfer and enhancing the development of professional skills. However, the success of MR technologies in teaching depends significantly on the teachers, who are rarely supported in the introduction and selection of MR technologies. In order to support teachers in the selection of suitable media and technologies, we present a multidimensional matrix to support the decision towards the usage of three different MR experiences in mining engineering education: Augmented Reality (AR), 360°, and Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. This matrix was built based on the result of several conducted interviews with the technology developers and users. The decision matrix differentiates between methodological aspects of teaching, infrastructural factors, individual prerequisites and knowledge of the teacher, all of which play a role in the selection of the right MR technology. In addition, examples of the use of the respective technology in teaching are discussed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={COVID-19 has radically changed society as we know it. To reduce the spread of the virus, millions across the globe have been forced to work remotely, often in make-shift home offices, and using a plethora of new, unfamiliar digital technologies. In this article, we critically analyse cyber security and privacy concerns arising due to remote working during the coronavirus pandemic. Through our work, we discover a series of security risks emerging because of the realities of this period. For instance, lack of remote-working security training, heightened stress and anxiety, rushed technology deployment, and the presence of untrusted individuals in a remote-working environment (e.g., in flatshares), can result in new cyber-risk. Simultaneously, we find that as organisations look to manage these and other risks posed by their remote workforces, employee’s privacy (including personal information and activities) is often compromised. This is apparent in the significant adoption of remote workplace monitoring, management and surveillance technologies. Such technologies raise several privacy and ethical questions, and further highlight the tension between security and privacy going forward. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Digital technologies have been widely utilized to assist with disease detection and management throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. The prevalence of smartphone usage amongst populations has assisted the provision of mobile applications that citizens can use to manage their health. Covid-19 symptom checker smartphone apps enable users to enter their health characteristics and receive validated advice related to self-isolation, testing and whether to seek clinical care. Moreover, the collection of symptom data can assist healthcare providers with disease surveillance and resource allocation. However, the adoption of symptom checker apps can be influenced by several factors including the functionality of the app, and data privacy and protection policies. In this study, we reviewed nine symptom checker apps that were available on the Android and iOS platforms. We analyzed characteristics related to the functionality and accessibility of the apps, and factors that related to privacy, transparency and trust. We found that most of the apps were multifunctional and several (n = 4) combined contact tracing and symptom checking functionalities. Moreover, there was variation in the quantity of personal data collected and symptom checking questions. For all the apps reviewed information related to privacy and data protection was available, however, there was variability in the content and readability of this material. Information regarding the technical profile of the apps was also inconsistent. For several of the apps, access to the symptom checking functionality was restricted by location. This review suggests that symptom checker apps provide an effective tool for public health management during the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Work has an important role in terms of promoting wellbeing. However, it can also have negative effects on our physical and mental wellbeing leading to stress, fatigue, poor teamwork and engagement, and burnout. Many companies treat workers in terms of enterprise resources. Operations management often overlooks the ‘human factor’ and specifically, the relationship between worker wellbeing and performance, and the design of work management processes and associated technologies to support this. The impact of new work and workforce practices/trends such as the blended and flexible workforce along with new automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies enabling business process, performance/work, and workforce management, presents both risks and opportunities. This paper introduces a new work management concept – namely, ‘intelligent work’. Intelligent work is defined in relation to work that is smart, health, ethical and safe. Critically, it is underpinned by concepts of workplace health protection and promotion, along with progress in automation and AI technologies. This concept has been advanced a part of a human factors action research program addressing responsible business, sponsored by the Irish government. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={We tackle the digital divide issue from the user experience point of view. Our study aim at obtaining information on the impact of UI/UX design choices on the participants’ achievement strategies. In that prospect, we asked voluntary participants receiving social benefits at a social action center to perform typical account management tasks on two French administration websites. Then we analyzed their visual exploration strategies. The results of this preliminary study suggest that highly symbolic pictographic representations are ignored by users in a situation of digital precariousness. They spend a large amount of time looking through the textual content to find indications, submenus or links to navigate rather than exploiting the shorthand access provided through the abstract icon system. These ergonomic choices constitute an additional barrier to the use of these technologies by fragile users. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Relying on the characteristics of decentralized, tamper-proof, and traceable, blockchain technology has begun to be widely used in permission management. It can be used for access control by using smart contracts to distribute tokens. But also because of the immutability of the blockchain, it cannot dynamically revoke permission. This paper proposed an on-chain user permission management mechanism that could support automatic and active permission revocation. This model proposed an extended CP-ABE chain user permission management model, which realized the permission grant based on user attributes by smart contracts. Furthermore, on this basis, an extended CP-ABE permission revocation mechanism was proposed. The timestamp technology was used to realize the automatic revocation of permission, and the subset coverage algorithm was used to realize the active revocation of permission. A blockchain-based permission distribution model was built, and the permission revocation scheme was introduced into it to conduct experiments. Its performance was tested and analyzed. The experimental results showed that when the number of permission distributions is 1000, the delay is about 5 s. At the same time, the permission change is above 130TPS, which met actual application requirements. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Blockchain has attracted widespread attention since its inception and one of the special technologies is smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs on blockchain that act as trusted intermediary between the users and are widely used in variety of industry (e.g., IoT, supply chain management). Smart contracts can store or manipulate valuable assets which may cause huge economic losses. Unlike traditional computer programs, the code of a smart contract cannot be modified after it is deployed on the blockchain. Hence, the security analysis and vulnerability detection of the smart contract must be performed before its deployment. In this survey, we considered 15 security vulnerabilities in smart contracts and introduced the vulnerable areas and the causes of vulnerabilities. According to the methods used, we introduced the existing smart contract analysis methods and vulnerability detection tools from three aspects of static analysis, dynamic analysis and formal verification. Finally, by considering the analysis tools and security vulnerabilities, we found that a new attack cannot be detected by existing detection tools if the vulnerability without pre-defined. We recommend using machine learning methods to analyze smart contracts in combination with traditional program vulnerabilities, and find vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered in smart contracts. In addition, many detection tools require too much resources or are too complex, so it is necessary to introduce new detection methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={E-government is a gradual system engineering, which needs to integrate new information technology. In e-government application scenarios, a large number of data (i.e. text, audio, video, graphics and animation) are managed by platforms maintained by data providers, which usually adopt centralized architecture design. However, this centralized architecture may lead to a single point of failure and data ownership disputes. It is difficult to ensure the integrity of the data and track the trusted traceability of data usage. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a cost-effective blockchain data storage framework for e-government data management. Generally speaking, in the field of e-government data management, the application trend of blockchain can be summarized into two aspects: one is to lay the foundation for the development of public services and government management through the establishment of identity authentication system based on blockchain; the other is to make use of the characteristics of blockchain, which can not be tampered with and has full historical records, so that the information resources of different institutions can be connected, which can achieve the goal Now the definition of data ownership and the traceability of data access. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays, large-scale IoT (Internet of Things) devices are connected to the network. However, due to the simplicity, limited memory and poor computing power of most IoT devices, it is difficult to apply complex security authentication protocols to these devices. Many attackers use this loophole, impersonating legitimate devices to launch malicious attacks on the network, threatening the security of other legitimate devices. Therefore, in order to strengthen the identification and management of devices, the existing device fingerprint identification technology based on machine learning is to extract device traffic at the access gateway and generate device fingerprinting to realize the identification of IoT devices. However, to achieve high recognition accuracy, existing device fingerprint algorithms need to extract a large number of fingerprint features from network traffic for machine learning, which increases the complexity of implementation and delay of device identification. Also, it is not suitable for the current large-scale access environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid feature selection method to preprocess features for the optimal feature subset, which can not only reduce the feature dimension, but also improve the accuracy of device recognition. Firstly, the method filters the irrelevant features according to the characteristic fluctuation and the entropy of correlation information between the feature and the target. Then, based on the classification accuracy of the learning algorithm, a random search method—forest optimization algorithm is used to further optimize the filtered feature subsets under the evaluation criteria. Experiments show that this method can reduce feature dimension by 81.0% and improve classification accuracy from 86.4% to 93.1%. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={System Wide Information Management (SWIM), as an advanced civil aeronautical information management method, aims to solve the problems of global civil aeronautical information systems such as difficulty in obtaining common data in a timely manner and high information exchange costs. SWIM was first proposed by Europe and the United States and was recognized and valued by the International Civil Aviation Organization. It is to ensure the correct information transmission at the correct time. In order for the consistent information in the “virtual information pool” to be efficiently, accurately and securely transmitted, the information and data in the SWIM environment need to be defined in detail and standardized, so the two sides of data interaction can maintain the consistency in syntax and semantics. The Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) is a core standard model for data transmission and format conversion, which mainly involves information in the aeronautical intelligence field. It covers multiple thematic elements such as airspace, airports and air routes, and provides a standardized description for data conversion and transmission in this field. The article analyzes the model composition of AIXM in the SWIM information exchange model, the modeling process, and the key technologies involved in model establishment, and preliminary design and implementation of AIXM. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nuclear reactor computing software need to process and maintain complex and massive data sets. In order to meet the requirement of mass data storage and processing in software, the data storage model and I/O method and programming interface of HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format v5) are deeply studied. According to the data storage and processing requirement of typical nuclear reactor computing data such as assembly or core neutronics computing data and core thermal-hydraulic computing data, RCDF-H5 (Reactor Compute Data Framework based on HDF5) is proposed. KYMRES (KYlin-2 Main RESults databank) and COMRES (COre Main RESults databank) are designed and implemented based on RCDF-H5. The performance tests show that RCDF-H5 has a higher I/O efficiency than conventional storage solutions. A new data storage and management solution for nuclear reactor computing software is provided. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Users can access shared data warehouses using a cloud infrastructure. It is important to verify the data successfully to ensure mutual data integrity. The accuracy checking of the shared data is carried out by an examination system that encourages Group members to alter data, but this method leads to complicated estimates as per the Group members. The monitoring method of the assigned agent estimates the group members lightly, but lacks the safety threats among the group members and their agents. With the implementation of Hash graph technology and the development of a management Third Party Medium (TPM) approach, a Lightweight Safe Cloud Storage Audition System (LSSA) is suggested, achieving group security protection and a lightweight group measurement. In the meantime, the TCP Sliding Fan Technology incorporates a simulated TPM pool with interconnected features to enhance support for the handler. We test our method in numerical analysis and tests, which prove that our system provides the groups with lightweight computing and ensures the safety data evaluation process. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The supply chain is essentially a network of businesses and people, who are involved in manufacturing or delivering products and services. As businesses have enlarged, the supply chains have become more complex, making them difficult to manage and optimize. In this scenario, “Blockchain” has emerged as a technology that helps in the efficient management of these complicated supply chains. In this research work, the block chain assisted “Supply Chain Management (SCM)” is introduced. With the intention of enhancing the security of the proposed SCM, a new privacy preservation approach is adopted, where the “Data Sanitization and Data Restoration” takes place with the optimally selected key. More importantly, in both the processes, the optimal key is generated via a standard “Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO)”. The proposed secures blockchain based PSCM model is validated by comparing it over the traditional models in terms of attack analysis. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Currently used automatic control systems for electric drives of ventilation systems do not fully meet the requirements for the quality of performance of heat engineering production processes. It is necessary to develop new management systems through the use of intelligent technologies. The mathematical description of the control object is obtained by the methods of the classical theory of automatic control. Optimization of control loops is performed using fuzzy algorithm synthesis methods. A model of a ventilation system using a fuzzy controller is considered. Methods for developing intelligent control systems for electric drives of ventilation and air conditioning systems are proposed. It is established that the developed intelligent methods of control of electric drives of ventilation systems can be used under strict requirements to the microclimate in the room to ensure comfortable conditions. The developed fuzzy model was applied in a university sport complex, and the results showed the effectiveness of the proposed model when comparing traditional systems. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Business process management has become the most widely-used and reliable approach to organizational management over the last decades. It is also considered as a part of quality management system in an organization. Business process modeling is the core of business process management, which is used for visualization, analysis, and improvement of organizational activities. Moreover, business process modeling plays an important role in the context of business process management maturity of an overall enterprise. Therefore, this paper is focused on the problem of business process model quality evaluation. Existing approaches based on business process modeling guidelines, measures, and their thresholds are considered. Refined business process modeling rules, measures, quality criteria of numerical and linguistic values, and a method for evaluation of business process model quality are proposed. The corresponding information technology is designed and implemented, and results of its usage are outlined. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Efficient human resource management needs accurate assessment and representation of available competencies as well as effective mapping of required competencies for specific jobs and positions. Thus, the definition and identification of competence gaps express differences between acquired and required competencies using a mathematical approach to support accurate competence analytics. Lack of skills and insufficient qualifications of employees are cited as major barriers to the adoption of new technologies in the context of Industry 4.0. These changes require skills for data analytics tasks. The purpose of this paper is to investigate gaps in the preparation of a business analyst between the requirements of the labor market and the standards of study programs. For the IT and other industries, the most important competencies from the study program of Ukrainian High Educational Institutes, which correspond to labor market requirements, were revealed using RStudio. Formation of business analysts’ competencies required in the labor market is created both higher education (47%) and experience of applicants on the labor market (53%). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={For management of massive data and centralized network, the data security research team has become a central issue. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a common practice to control access to sensitive data. This article uses Flex and C# to develop an RBAC model, which can make data management more flexible. Concentrating on data security, this article presents the layer structure and model design for standardized management of security access. This article also implements detailed approaches for data security by verifying parameters and codes, access control, preventing illegal users and using oracle parameters and stored procedures for database security technology. In addition, an empirical study was conducted to assess effectiveness and usefulness. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Modern educational complexes using information technology (IT) should form a controlled environment with the ability to systematically collect and process information about the educational process. A permanent analysis of information about students, as well as educational materials, will allow us to identify the classes of students and educational content that are most suitable for each other in terms of time and success in learning. In the architecture of the educational system using IT, technological solutions have been identified that provide the formation of a database and a knowledge base required to solve this problem. On the basis of the specific features of the educational process implementation, it is possible to use various sets of technologies to solve certain didactic tasks, but it is the integrated application of the technologies described in the article that reveals the potential in the field of the education management quality. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The education system always reflects technological changes taking place in society. On the one hand, education reacts to such changes, on the other hand, in the bowels of the education system new members of the society that affect technologicalization are trained. Currently, about half of the world’s population is of an age characterized by the widespread use of information technology. For this part of global society, the use of modern technology in education is natural. This article discusses the process of technological societal development, characterized by a sequence of industrial revolutions. It shows that, arising from the development of informatization tools, information revolutions are superimposed on such revolutions. The characteristic features of the taking place right now fourth industrial revolution, which are significant from the point of view of the educational system development, are discussed. A well-reasoned forecasting of a new information revolution related to the emergence of automated translation systems is carried out. For each of the aspects of such revolutions, the set of proposed recommendations for improving the content, methods, tools and other components of educational systems is described. The article also considers the negative consequences for society and its educational system that can entail new information and industrial revolutions. The approaches by which the education system can reduce the negative aspects of the transition of society to a new informational and technological stage of its development are discussed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Social media systems have become a primary platform to consume and exchange information nowadays. The systems usually have three main components: media sources, content distributors (social media services), and content consumers, which we call social media content delivery ecosystem. A content distributor has social algorithms, as a black box, that were designed and trained to pick up, filter, and rank the most relevant and desired content to be delivered to each individual one of us. However, these modern social algorithms were typically complicated, so we do not really know how these social algorithms work such that we are unsure about the quality of the delivered content. Most researchers have worried about user side and investigated how fair of the contents that were delivered from social algorithms to users. On the other hand, no one focuses on impact of social algorithms on publisher side. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to understand how social algorithms have an impact on content publishers in social media ecosystem. From our SINCERE data, we firstly illustrate time series of all posts in each of global and local news media Facebook pages, including CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, and The Sacramento Bee, which were plotted in timeline during 2008 to early 2018 to see how they changed in terms of publishing times. We found that global news media changed their publish time. Our hypothesis was that they changed because social algorithms were changed. If they got better user reaction after changing publishing time somehow, we could assume social algorithms might deliver more contents to users at that time. We evaluated user reactions by the number of participants and user response time. We found that content most publishers got better reactions from users after changing publishing time. Therefore, we conclude that news media changed their time periods to published their post in order to make their content be more visible to users because social algorithms were changed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Data storage has been a problem as technology advances, there are more devices capable of capturing images, sounds, videos, etc. On the security side, many people choose to use security cameras that are available 24 h a day to capture anomalous events and maintain the security of the area, however, storing all captured videos generates high costs, as well as the prolonged analysis that this type of videos implies. For this reason, we propose a method that allows selecting only the important events captured by a video surveillance camera and then classifying them among the types of most constant criminal acts in Peru. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Billions of ads are displayed on a daily basis, making it a multi-billion industry. Most of web pages contain multiple ads, which are largely served in real time using a bidding process where buyers (advertisers) offer a price tag to the seller (publishers) for each given possible ad on the page. There are multiple factors that impact an ad price, one of the primary ones is the ad-location’s viewability likelihood. Due to the length of many web pages, certain ad locations are invisible to the visiting user, as he may not scroll far enough on the page to where the ads are placed. According to recent industry metrics, less than 60% of ads are viewable. This poses a challenge to both: buyers and sellers. Buyers want to optimize the likelihood they buy an ad that will be viewed, while sellers want to maximize ad prices (by setting higher floor prices) by providing as many possible ad placements with high viewability probability. This paper addresses the viewability prediction from the publisher’s side, and proposes a novel algorithm based on cascading gradient boosting. The algorithm enables sellers to predict an accurate viewability probability for ad impressions, which is optimized to match the actual viewability rate that will be measured for the served ads. Unlike other algorithms that optimize these problems to an average minimal difference from a central mean error, we propose an algorithm that increases the amount of extreme cases - which are the most valuable ones, thus expanding the premium ad inventory. We evaluate the algorithm on two datasets with a total of over 500 million impressions. We found that the algorithm outperforms other viewability prediction algorithms, works well for publishers while providing a measurable fairness metric to advertisers. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Work design is being constantly transformed by technology and requirements for polyvalent workers piloting the work system instead of operating it. Performance no longer depends exclusively on working hours, but in multiple aspects that balance the vision of production systems results. The purpose of this paper is to investigate self-management teams’ implementation and its effects on performance. A Brazilian cosmetics company case study of team development was used as a guidance for this investigation and company performance reports were the data source for descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis. Boxplot performance analysis was applied over team building stages along with One-way Variance Analysis to test average performance differences among stages’ transitions. Tukey test was sequentially applied to identify its statistic differences in pairs. Results revealed team development reached the expected performance over team stages. Forming to storming, though, was the only transition with no performance average gains. Storming to norming was the highest improvement, which meets literature principles. The present research is limited to a single sociotechnical environment and performance measurement is based on average data. Therefore, specific conclusions imply further research to extend findings to other contexts. However, the present study identified empowerment best practices to achieve superior performance. The originality of this paper consists on providing consistent connection between team development theory and practice, exploring sociotechnical approach benefits through practices into performance. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Solar radiation and wind data play an important role in renewable energy projects to produce electricity. In Ecuador, these data are not always available for locations of interest due to absences of meteorological stations. In the scope of this paper, a low-cost automatic meteorological station prototype based on Raspberry technology was developed to measure the aforementioned variables. The objective of this paper is twofold: a) to present a proposal for the design of a low-cost automatic weather station using the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, showing the feasibility of this technology as an alternative for the construction of automatic meteorological station and; b) to use Forecasting with neural networks to predict solar radiation in Manta, Ecuador, based on the historical data collected: solar radiation, wind speed and wind direction. We proved that both technology feasibility and Machine learning has a high potential as a tool to use in this field of study. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The smart meter is one of the indispensable devices in the Smart Grid (SG). A smart meter is an advanced energy meter that collects user power consumption data and provides information. Several sensors and control units coordinately work in the smart meter. In this research paper, a novel Smart Meter design is proposed for power measurement data collection to assist end-users for energy savings. The proposed system is a wireless monitoring system to measure the power consumption of electrical appliances at home. The system comprises of Node-stations, which are electrical meters at the customer’s house, and central data collection system that communicates via RF channel. The software at the master station helps store power in memory ICs and displays them graphically in real-time. The Node stations are built using Atmega328P microprocessor and current-voltage sensors, communicating with the Main station via the NRF24L01 module. The Main station uses the Arduino Mega module and stores information on 24C32 ROM chip and performs real-time management using RTC DS1307 IC. The proposed system operates within a distance of 100 m, a delay of 100 ms, and an accuracy of up to 96%. With the proposed system, users can track how much energy is used as well as the associated cost. Moreover, the Management software provides instructions and recommendations to optimize the time and duration of household electrical appliances. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Currently, vehicle to vehicle communication is an important application and thrust area of research. In this paper the author highlighted the workings, executions, implementations and the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in transport management and vehicle to vehicle communication systems. The main advantage of this Industry 4.0 based IoT technology is that it helps us to reduce road traffic and accidents. The limitations of GPS like accuracy, precision, effective analysis, etc. has led to the evolution of Mobile based V2V communication which is more effective, error proof, result oriented and smart. For proper analysis of traffic vehicle to vehicle communication is established. Random Data from vehicles taken by numerous sensors. Any car coming in its variety could effortlessly share the data by either of two cars nearby. With the help of vehicle to vehicle communication we can provide a path of emergency vehicles to reach the destination quickly. Based on the V2V application, Red and Green signals can be marked on the path as per traffic density and the emergency vehicle can take the shortest, fastest and low density route. Similar such examples are elaborated in the current research manuscript that will help the researcher in effectively finding the research gap for further advancement, analysis, innovation and optimization. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Today’s Internet backbone network offers enhanced performance to overcome loss, delay, and unavailability. In the occurence of failure of a component, the network becomes susceptible to problems like link faults, path faults, and router failure. Link failure causes looping, packet dropping, loss of data and unreliable network communication. So an efficient fault management implementation is vital to handle multiple link failures. Fault management is vital to get the network back to normal.To properly operate and maintain a complex network, the system as a whole, and each of its essential individual components, must work in tandem. In this proposed approach On-demand Link State (OLS) routing, with shared bandwidth technology is implemented for fault management, for handling multiple link failures. It guarantees the forwarding of loop free data to destinations in case of any number of network failures. The core idea of OLS routing is a blacklist, which carries information on downgraded links identified along the path that are to be avoided. This ensures uninterrupted data packet forwarding without packets getting dropped. Also, the shortest path to the destination is located, based on the state and cost of the link (Robertson and Nelakuditi 2012). © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The manufacturing industry is undergoing a major transformation based on the emerging industry 4.0 technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, internet of things and cyber-physical systems. These novelty technologies aim at providing central management for the user’s flexible manufacturing requirements and information. Also, the advent of these technologies has transformed the process planning and became crucial for the building of knowledge-based process planning environments. However, current praxis cannot deal with all semantic issues within this new paradigm, as requirements must be clear, consistent, measurable, stand-alone, testable, unambiguous, unique and verifiable. In this context, multicriteria decision analysis models have gained focus of the scientific and industrial communities as a support tool for the decision-making process in the product development and advanced manufacturing as these processes excel in environments with numerous and conflicting alternatives, providing the optimal alternative. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to highlight the current issues and research tendencies regarding ontology-based interoperability systems, multicriteria decision analysis and their integration. To achieve this goal, it will be applied a literature review on the targeted technologies, discussing the current tendencies of the field and the main issues regarding their implementation and integration. Finally, the paper points themes for further research and indicates viable concepts that can compose a solution for the gaps in a systematic manner. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Knowledge graphs (KGs) are developing rapidly and has a wide range of applications in various fields. But there have been relatively few Chinese encyclopedias with the scholar knowledge graph so far. Therefore, we rely on the academic social network-SCHOLAT to complete the construction of scholar KG. The purpose of this scholar KG is to solve the problems that the information of scholars is not updated in time and scattered in the organizations’ websites. This paper introduces in detail the key technologies for constructing scholar KG, such as knowledge extraction, organization and management of scholar KG. At the same time, we take advantages of KG in semantic expression into account. We apply the scholar KG to the scholar encyclopedia system. Based on the scholar KG, we completed the scholar recommendation on the Scholar Encyclopedia. On the other hand, the scholar KG will also provide the basis for more intelligent applications of SCHOLAT in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={I have participated for about 40 years in the most astonishing technical development of Geographic Information Systems and seen the inclusion of spatial information technology in nearly all forms of it: spatial database technology, GPS, the web, mobile smart phones. Ubiquitous computing and connectivity became possible. The article will firstly reviews the history of GIS use and divides the development of the enabling technology for GIS use approximately in decades. The development can be broken in roughly decades characterized by the technology which enabled the then dominant GIS use. The article will then includes some tentative ideas for developments which could occur in the next decade. I will try to draw some conclusions from the review: why did some technologies become successful in the marketplace and while some other did not? What makes a technology to become a smashing commercial success? Google maps might be the most spectacular, but by far not the only example. My experience leads me to believe that commercial success is the result of the combination of three conditions: a fundamental human need is at the core - e.g. people need to navigate in the world and must avoid to get lost,a cost-effective technical means to satisfy this need is available - e.g. widely available smartphones, and,a business-opportunity is identified - e.g. selling advertisement. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Geospatial tools such as GIS (Geographic Information Systems) serve as a popular technology to assess and evaluate spatial dimensions of the food environment. While local-level policy decisions can be aided using GIS analysis and GIS data, little work has been invested in the holistic understanding of the data on which these decisions are made. In this paper, we address what entails high-quality geospatial data, challenges and opportunities that exist in the field of geospatial data development as applied to local-scale food environment research. We further explored factors of geospatial data quality assessment and quality control (QA/QC) for a commercially available business (CAB) database typically used in high-scale geospatial data analysis of the food environment. Factors related to the physical location of all food sources such as grocery stores and farmers markets and individualized vehicular transportation (roads) rated highest. They outweighed those related to land cover, utilities and zoning, which are more important in medium and low-scale (national level) analysis. When ranking various dimensions of data quality, subject matter experts found positional accuracy and attribute accuracy to be the most important in data development. However, errors related to temporal accuracy (age of data) exhibited the greatest number of errors within a CAB database. This schism serves as the impetus of this project and further addresses challenges between conceptual and practical geospatial data development policies and procedures. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Technology development projects are constantly subject to risks and uncertainties and their performance are key to deliver the organizational value. Failing to meet project goals and objectives is critical, therefore, projects must be able to cope with an environment of complexity and pressure. This paper aims to assess and improve project resilience by using the Functional Resonance Analysis Model (FRAM) to look at project review process, a stage-gate milestone typical to Systems Engineering process. FRAM is supported by the Resilience Engineering perspective that things go wrong by the same reasons they go right, and everyday work is subject to variability and small adjustments, which is key to address such project environments. After assessing sources of variability and aggregating them, means to manage variability are proposed order to increase process resilience. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In recent years, with the increasing importance of education and the development of technology such as the internet and big data, more and more researchers have applied big data research to the field of education. Although big data contains high value, it can easily lead to information overload. Therefore, researchers have developed an education recommendation system that combines education with big data to find valuable information from massive data. Based on the user's historical behavior, the recommendation system can find out the user's interest characteristics, analyze the user's needs and interests, and thereby recommend content that the user is interested in. But when it comes to new users or new products, the recommendation system can not find information about their preferences, which can easily cause data sparseness and cold start problem. In this paper, we propose a cold-start recommendation model for interests, which can enhance the usability of user-related data. The model first uses the Pearson coefficient to calculate the learning interest perception relationship between users with temporal context. Second, based on this model, we use neural network to analyze the semantics of relevant data. In order to find suitable relevant data for recommendation, we use the KNN algorithm by reducing the number of neural network outputs. Finally, the experimental results are proved from the real data of Douban book, experiments show that cold-start recommendation model for learning interests solves the problem of data sparseness and cold start to a certain extent that is compared with the traditional recommendation model based on collaborative filtering algorithm. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The evolution of information technology is accompanied by a comprehensive modification of the service sector, including microfinancing. This part of the Russian financial market shows stabilize growth annually. However, the availability of loans for Russians in a symbiosis with low financial literacy and high debt burden led to a large number of debts to MFOs. This, together with the tendency to an increase in the number of cases of license withdrawal from MFOs, leads to the relevance of developing a scoring model that could identify borrowers with high profitability and low probability of default at the stage of applying for a microloan and “cut off” potentially insolvent applicants. Within the framework of this work, a methodology for clustering MFO clients is proposed based on the fuzzy criterion “level of financial responsibility”, which is the basis for assessing the effectiveness of microfinance. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Blockchain is an effective means to store data securely. Existing blockchain systems mostly adopt the equal mining mode, and all bookkeepers (entities) record ledger books on a single main chain, resulting in random data storage in the whole blockchain. Moreover, in complex or classification scenarios, data in a single main chain cannot be correlated or regularly stored, resulting in low storage efficiency. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a composite chain structure blockchain storage method based on blockchain technology. This method firstly proposes the blockchain model of composite chain structure, then constructs the private chain and alliance chain respectively, and finally realizes the adaptive data association storage in complex or classified scenarios. The experimental results show that a composite chain structure blockchain storage method based on blockchain technology proposed in this paper has great advantages in storage efficiency, storage overhead, security performance, availability and other aspects. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising technology capable of interconnecting billions of devices over the Internet. Many challenges in IoT arise due to the increase in the number and diversity of connected devices. The heterogeneity in IoT by the presence of a variety of technologies, protocols, and data representation formats, added to the massive connection of devices, makes the administration, performance adjustments and network configuration a task that requires scalability. Technologies such as software-defined networks (SDN) help to mitigate these problems. SDNs allow simplified network administration, offer programmability, flexibility, and agility, through the SDN controller that provides a global vision of the network topology allowing to create a fully programmable scalable architecture for the management of different IoT devices. This document provides a review of the architecture of SDN and IoT, focusing on managing IoT with SDN. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The emerging technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are exponentially changing the work performance and showing transformation in various fields such as companies, shedding its light on medical, financial affairs, logistics, retail market, education, and human resource. The prevailing AI data-driven substantial IQ interactivity is moving towards the deeply challenged human traits, including emotional skills, establishing and maintaining interpersonal relationships, detecting the severity of anxiety as well as stress in mental health care, implanting empathy. The emerging bond between the physical world and digital technologies leads to a powerful creation of Emotion AI or affective computing agents that contribute to sensing, adapting, and interpreting the human emotions wellbeing at the workplace. The paper presents the proposed framework for the evolutionary stages of artificial intelligence in the business domain, specifically human resource management. The methodology attempts to examine the role of artificial Intelligence technologies in human resources practices. The statistical computation of proposed methodology is measured using T and Anova Test respectively. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Information technologies (IT) promise great benefits. However, companies have business alignment problems, affecting investment, performance and agility. To achieve alignment, enterprise architecture (EA) reference models called Frameworks have been developed. These proposals were born in large companies and their design has a traditional approach to these realities. However, in Peru most companies are micro-enterprises, i.e. small organizations (SOs), with their own characteristics. SOs have a low Networked Readiness Index (NRI), generating little impact on Peru’s development. Therefore, this paper proposes a new business architecture methodology conceived for the reality of small Peruvian and Latin American organizations. A general method based on EA and SO criteria was developed, thus generating a metamodel, from which the elements of the methodology are instantiated, which integrates four approaches to IT management. The methodology developed was validated in a Peruvian SO and by experts. The preliminary results show that its use generates benefits with respect to the competition. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In recent decades, knowledge graph plays an increasingly significant role in intelligent information services. However, for some domains, knowledge graphs are constructed for special purposes and disconnected with each other, which fails to take advantage of knowledge from different knowledge graphs. To this end, we are motivated to propose the concept of knowledge graph federation. In this keynote, we first discuss the issues about knowledge graph federation, and then we introduce two technologies of automatic knowledge graph construction, i.e., relation extraction and entity alignment. The issues in this keynote will provide guidelines for the development of knowledge graph technology. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The lack of usability of automated medical record management systems holds back the quality of health care services in health institutions. This situation is especially critical with the increase of the number of patients because of the pandemic of COVID-19. In the present work, a web-based medical records management system was developed with an easy-to-use interface for digital immigrant users. For the management and development of the project, the XP (eXtreme Programming) methodology of the software life cycle was successfully applied. The system was developed using open source technologies: PHP as programming language and the Bootstrap framework for the design of user interfaces. The result was an elegant and modern user interface that provides ease of use to digital immigrant users. The system was validated through an experimental evaluation carried out at the medical center of “La Concordia”, in Ecuador. This evaluation was based on Jakob Nielsen usability principles and the software product quality norms of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. The heuristic validation of the proposal resulted in a 93% of acceptance whilst function tests where successful in 96% of times. Besides, the result of a SUS test with the participation of five digital immigrants turn out in a 91.5% of system usability. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this software is now in exploitation in a local medical center with successful results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Clinics, medical centers, other healthcare institutions are faced with a large amount of personal data of both employees and patients. Many documents fall into the category of medical confidentiality. Medical institutions are switching to electronic document management, electronic records or medical records of patients are being automated. Problems of optimizing registries and securing databases have become actual for healthcare. With the development of information technology, the transition of medical institutions to a new level of processing and storage of personal data has accelerated. Hacking the information infrastructure of a medical institution can cause colossal financial damage to medical institutions and companies, and, more importantly, pose a real threat to the health and life of patients. This work describes the process of assessing the security of the information infrastructure of healthcare institutions. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Smart waste management is one of the most important services in smart cities. An efficient waste collection system based on IoT technologies allows having the streets clean and reducing resource consumption by optimizing garbage collecting trucks’ routes. In this situation, the present work proposes a smart management system based on LoRaWAN. This solution seeks to mitigate the presence of containers that are at their maximum storage capacity. This solution will contribute to mitigate the spread of diseases due to it avoids having waste in the open air. Different tests of the proposed solution (i.e. communication distance, speed, and energy consumption) were performed to determinate the possibility of real implementations. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The term «Internet of Medical Things» (IoMT) refers to a set of devices and technologies for remote monitoring of patients’ health using wearable devices. One primary problem with patient’s data is ensuring privacy when it is transmitted over open communication channels and stored in cloud systems. A whole range of different approaches to these issues are available. However, when it comes to millions of IoT devices, technologies that have already become classic for Internet resources are not suitable in many aspects at once. The aim of this work is to develop methods and protocols for secure interaction between portable diagnostic devices and cloud services for the analysis and processing of medical data in the Internet of Medical Things networks. The work considered existing technologies and solutions for ensuring security in IoMT networks and personalized medicine systems; also, it focused on secure machine learning methods. Previous studies have emphasized attribute-based encryption (ABE) as a prospective method for data privacy and security. These algorithms solve many problems for IoMT applications: patient’s data confidentiality, flexible key management, fine-grained access control mechanisms, and user control over data. We have proposed a framework for processing patient data from portable diagnostic devices using ABE methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In 2015, CSCS and the Swiss national weather and climate service (a.k.a. MeteoSwiss) have deployed the first GPU accelerated HPC system for numerical weather prediction (NWP), which has been in operation since Spring of 2016. As part of the lifecycle management, an eighttimes more performant system that can support an upgraded model had to be developed, but at constant cost. This new system is scheduled to go into operation later in 2020. The performance of viable GPUs at a given price has not been sufficiently increasing in recent years. With a fixed budget envelope, the traditional design for operational NWP with two, fully redundant and self-contained systems, was no longer viable to support operations of the 2020–2024 model. We have solved the challenge with a software defined infrastructure concept from cloud infrastructure technologies, and designed a single system with builtin redundancies that would meet reliability requirements with only 1.5 x the number of (expensive) compute nodes needed for the operational NWP. Specifically, concept of network tenants is introduced to define a production, a failover/research-and-development (R&D) and a system test-anddevelopment tenant. Moreover, operational resiliency metrics are ensured via transparent migration of components, similar to cloud environments but with subtle differences to ensure bare-metal performance and scaling of MeteoSwiss simulations. In the paper, we will describe the process for designing and operating a cloud-technology driven, high-availability operational HPC service in a cost-effective manner. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Recent technological advances in medical informatics led to the adoption of new technologies in pathology clinical area. Digital pathology is allowing the acquisition, storage, and distribution of pathological digital samples, which are gathered by scanners and displayed in network workstations. This paper discusses the opportunities and challenges of digital pathology, and how it is changing education, training, and medical practice nowadays. A new paradigm of collaborative telepathology is proposed through a cloud-based architecture, fully compliant with the DICOM standard, that integrates a cross-platform pathology viewer, collaborative tools, virtual work-spaces, and personal storage areas. Data management and privacy are ensured through the implementation of a role-based access control mechanism. The solution was designed to serve distinct use cases, including telepathology and e-academy. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Critical thinking (CT) helps us to distinguish between good and bad arguments, to recognize information that has value from that which is essential, to find well-founded conclusions, to create alternatives, to improve communication and, finally, to have our own thinking and acting accordingly. Mathematics makes it possible to reinforce CT as it develops a constant search for truth through precise and exact techniques. Besides the active, collaborative and participative methodologies of learning, the uses of information and communication technologies enhance a set of advantages at the pedagogical level, namely the GeoGebra and Socrative at CT. The participants in this study were undergraduate students of Business Management and postgraduate students of Pre-service Teachers from two Portuguese public higher education institutions. The aim of the study is to investigate students in problem solving on sequences and geometry reasoning and the CT skills and dispositions (truth seeking, creativity, inquisitiveness) developed or not. Qualitative data findings have suggested that students exhibit CT skills and dispositions for arithmetic and geometric sequences. Another result, the study identified issues dealing with geometric constructions through a dynamic geometry system (DGS), they found it was easier to solve problems with “pencil and paper” instead of using DGS. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In recent years, software defined networking (SDN) has been a promising tool for achieving flexible satellite networks, exploiting the advantage that it follows the idea of “renewing switch functions without changing hardware”. Southbound interfaces (SBIs) are recognized as pivotal technologies in SDN for flexible network management and control, though, are faced with tough challenges posed by satellite networks. The OpenFlow, a representative and pervasive protocol in existing SBIs, only applies to wired communication systems such as Ethernet. However, satellite networks have unique characteristics in structure and service types distinguished from terrestrial wired networks, which means the unmodified implementation of existing SBIs cannot satisfy the needs of satellite networks. Based on the problem above, this paper aims to redesign a SBI well fitting to heterogeneous software defined satellite networks. Firstly, this paper analyzes the applicability of existing SBIs in a heterogeneous scenario comprising remote sensing satellites and relay satellites. Secondly, a SBI design framework is proposed, in which a scheme of building an intermediate layer on top of the OpenFlow is presented for reducing the protocol complexity. This framework gives a paradigm of the OpenFlow extension and serves as a exploratory work for achieving unified resource management in software-defined satellite networks. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This paper proposes an integrated system for vehicle-related services and records management using blockchain technology, where various stakeholders (vehicle owners, regional transport offices, insurance issuers, pollution control test centers, traffic police) can avail or provide various services (vehicle’s registration, driving license issuance, insurance and pollution-under-control certificates issuance, automated insurance claim, auditable trail of vehicle’s documents access and verification) in a hassle-free manner without any untrusted intermediaries. While the use of blockchain technology increases accountability, transparency, and trust in the system, this allows a cohesive integration of the proposed system with other smart city digital infrastructures easily. We develop a prototype of our proposal as a proof of concept using Hyperledger Fabric, adopting Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policy, and we present an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the system. To the best of our knowledge, this proposal is the first of its kind to provide a common blockchain-based platform for all vehicle-related services and records management. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The complexity of managing cloud applications’ life-cycle increases with the widening of the cloud landscape, as new IT players gain market share. Cloud orchestration frameworks promise to handle such complexity offering user-friendly management tools that help customers to transparently deal with portability and interoperability issues, by hiding away the heterogeneity of the cloud providers’ proprietary interfaces. Regarding the provisioning of cloud-enabled applications, the containerisation paradigm, along with the related micro-services technology, has managed to deliver the portability promise. While most of cloud orchestration frameworks support container-based cluster technologies, a standard-based approach to describe containerised applications still lacks. In this work, we propose TORCH, a TOSCA-based cloud orchestrator capable of interfacing to theoretically any container run-time software by leveraging a standard-aligned and easy-to-use language to describe application requirements. Validation tests run on a small-scale test-bed prove the viability of the proposed solution. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Process mining is a research discipline that offers methods and tools for analyzing various processes. There are a variety of process mining techniques that have in common the use of an event log as a starting point for research. In most cases, it is a flat event log (for example, in the form of a text file) containing prepared information about events. Most information systems that work with large data use the technology of relational database management systems (RDBMS) for their effective storage and processing. Recently, there has been a trend towards greater integration of RDBMSs with process mining tools. With the direct interaction of a process mining tool with a database, it becomes possible to transfer part of the “costly” data preparation operations directly to the RDBMS level. This work represents an approach in which an arbitrary database is considered as a direct data source for process mining; that is, data are extracted without using intermediate flat logs and processed directly by process mining algorithms. An approach is proposed for translating event logs represented using RDBs into their abstract representation. There is described a novel method for embedding translation schemes inside a database in the form of so-called configurations, each of which corresponds to one data perspective/process view. This allows getting instrumented self-described DB event logs and switching between different embedded perspectives without rebuilding the logs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The edge or edge computing refers to the computational infrastructure between sensors and Internet-of-Things world on the one side and centralised cloud data centres on the other. Edge clusters could consist of small single-board devices, which are widely used in different applications. This includes microcontrollers regulating an industrial process or controllers monitoring and managing traffic roadside. Although generally hardware capabilities of devices are growing, resources at the edge are often still limited, requiring an intelligent resource management. This can done through self-adaptive scaling mechanisms in these clusters allowing to scale components of the application in the cluster. We introduce here an auto-scalable cluster architecture for lightweight container-based edge devices. A serverless architecture forms the core of this architecture. The auto-scaling component is based on fuzzy logic in order to better manage uncertainty problems arising in such contexts. Our evaluations show that our platform architecture and the auto-scaling functionality satisfy the need of lightweightness in edge architecture. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the traditional supply chain traceability model, a centralized management method is prevalent in supply chain traceability system. Problems such as falsification of production data, difficulty in information sharing, and opaque data have become more and more prominent. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, openness, transparency and traceability, and can overcome many shortcomings of centralized traceability systems. Building supply chain traceability system based on blockchain technology provides an effective way solving the problems arousing in the supply chain safety domain. We propose SCT-CC, a supply chain traceability system based on cross-chain technology of blockchain. First, we use cross-chain technology to design a multi-chain architecture. Then, we design smart contracts for different agencies in the supply chain. Finally, we use Hyperledger fabric as a development framework and built an experimental environment using Docker technology. We also test the query interface and the write interface. Through the analysis of the test results, the system can meet the needs of actual applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Scare water resources necessitates technological involvement in irrigation scheduling, that can help to manage water according to the weather condition of different seasons, crop growth stage and landscape information. The proposed method calculates actual water required using machine learning model and Evapotranspiration. The model is trained using real time weather data to predict actual water requirement. Reference Evapotranspiration is calculated with the help of Penman-Monteith Method. Before starting with this real time system proposed model is implemented with the help of past 10 years web scraped weather data. Proposed algorithms of water requirement and Irrigation scheduling is executed on scrapped data. After successful results system is implemented for real time use. Furthermore, system consists of eight Arduino nodes that acting as a slave to read weather, soil landscape and rain data. In addition, three Raspberry-pi equipped with the Wi-Fi module, acting as server to send collected data to a remote web server. These databases are used as input for machine learning algorithm. As per the observations of proposed system water usage is getting reduced in large quantity as compared to the traditional irrigation system used for irrigation. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of economic globalization, a product usually involves different organizations from the origin to retail. These organizations form a supply chain to collaborate to provide products to end-users. The arrival of the digital age offers excellent convenience for the supply chain management. However, it is difficult for existing supply chain management systems to share credit, which leads to end-users’ concerns about the quality of products. The blockchain technology, characterized by tamper-proof, traceability, and distributed sharing, is expected to solve the it. Also, supply chain management also increasingly depends on the use of the Internet of things. However, the throughput limitation of current blockchain systems significantly constrains their applications to IoT data storage and management. In this paper, we propose a cross-chain solution based on IOTA and Fabric for supply chain data management. We design and implement a supply chain data management system based on a cross-chain gateway of blockchain. The system has three layers, including blockchain layer, business layer, and application layer, which provide essential logistics functions in supply chain management. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the implemented system. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Stability control system (SCS) plays a very important role in the operation of power systems, so it is correspondingly essential to ensure the reliability of the SCS during its experimental and verification process. However, there are numerous problems in the management of the paper form based experiment mode of SCS today, such as long circulation cycle caused by low work efficiency, insecure and diseconomy on storage. More importantly, it is difficult to query and review historical records quickly, and it may even lead to the loss of records for various reasons. In this paper, taking advantage of blockchain technology, all the information of each experimental stage of SCS, including the approval information, experimental environment information, experimental equipment information of each manufacturer, experimental test reports and conclusions, are packaged and distributed managed. And then, a blockchain based experimental management system framework with the unified data form and module interface is proposed, in which the whole process of process record can be traced and cannot be tampered with. The experimental management system can be applied in the whole process of the SCS, including the experiment scheme making, experiment environment constructing, experiment processing, result evaluating, and results storage, etc. The blockchain based mechanism and system framework is expect to take many advantage to experiment management of SCS. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to highlight the advantages of Climate-Smart Agriculture and the progress accomplished by implementing information technology to make agriculture intelligent. The research article also includes the circumstances for policy and investment to succeed under climate change in sustainable agricultural growth for food security. It also involves a cropping calendar that differs for males, females, and kids to classify the gender division of labor and access and resource control. Climate information is taken from various tools such as the Department of Meteorology, Satellite Images, WSN, and IoT Tool Kit. Accordingly, tree cultivating, preservation agriculture, minimum tillage, and natural resource management are accumulated under the single umbrella of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA). The aim of this paper is to have a glance of relationships between CSA and its application. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The continuous demand for low latency, high reliability, and context-aware content has pushed the existing computational models to their limit. The cloud with its infinite resources can accommodate many of the existing scenarios, however, as new scenarios emerge in the IoT area, the cloud falls short. In this context, the Edge Computing model emerged as an extension to the cloud in support of low latency and high-performance applications, by placing part of cloud resources at the edge of the network, in close proximity to the data sources and applications. The goal of Edge Computing is to provide the same level of abstraction at the cloud but in a local context. However, since Edge Computing inherits many of the benefits provided by the cloud, it also inherits some of its drawbacks. One such limitation is the management overhead needed to set-up and continuously configure the Edge Computing applications. In the cloud space, this problem has been addressed using a new paradigm called serverless technology. Similarly, in the Edge Computing, few attempts are being developed to bring the concept of Serverless Computing at the edge. In this paper, we survey the main edge computing platforms that provide support for serverless computing comparing their characteristics and identifying issues and research directions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Critical infrastructure is becoming dependent on Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. These sensors measure various physical values and send them via a communication network in the form of electronic data. Data is then used by a management center for detailed analysis and system control. This technology can be used in various scenarios, from smart grid networks to autonomous vehicles. All these scenarios require innovative technologies in order to stay productive, efficient and resource friendly. These technologies include software-defined networks, which support network programmability. This allows rapid deployment of innovative applications, which can be dynamically adjusted as needs of the network change. The adjustment requires only a software modification which provides scalability of the solution. The key part of such a solution is quality of the control software application and the system configuration. Currently, there is no unified methodology which would summarize the best practices for developing such a system. This paper provides a list of system requirements for software-defined IoT networks for critical infrastructure. This list is one of the key phases in every system development process. Use of the list can help with development of high quality, scalable, efficient, and secure SDN systems, which can be deployed in critical infrastructure scenarios. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Smart and sustainable solid waste management systems (SWMS) are of major interest in the development of smart sustainable cities (SSC). Selective waste collection and transportation are known to be major expenditures of city waste management systems. In this paper, we investigate a waste management system for domestic waste in a Norwegian municipality as a case study. Different scenarios for route planning are considered to improve cost and time usage. The study provides an auxiliary management system for multi-objective TSP using Google Maps and operation research (OR) tools for optimal domestic waste collection. Additionally, a prediction model for scheduling future waste collection trips is provided, whereby challenges such as road conditions, road traffic, CO2 and other gases emissions, and fuel consumption are considered. The proposed prediction model considers the hazards associated with food waste bins that need to be emptied more frequently than bins containing other waste types such as plastic and paper. Both proposed models signify consistency and correctness. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Computing resources are being moved towards the edge of the network, in the form of so-called fog nodes, providing benefits in terms of reduced latency, increased processing speed, data locality, and energy savings. Data produced in end devices like smartphones, sensors or IoT devices can be stored, processed and analysed across a continuum of computing resources, from end devices via fog nodes to cloud services. Data related to critical domains, such as healthcare, public surveillance or home automation, requires tailored data protection mechanisms, spanning the whole computing continuum. The FogProtect project aims to provide novel advanced technologies and methodologies to ensure end-to-end protection of such sensitive data. Our generic solutions facilitate the provisioning and usage of applications and services in the computing continuum, by combining four technology innovations: (1) secure data container technology for data portability and mobility, (2) data-protection-aware adaptive service and resource management, (3) advanced data protection policy management, (4) dynamic data protection risk management models and tools. The applicability and impact of those solutions is evaluated and demonstrated on three complementary real-world use cases in the area of (1) smart cities, (2) smart manufacturing, and (3) smart media. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={An advancement in Hyperspectral Imaging (HI) technology is creating important attraction among the researchers to develop better classification techniques. This technology is well known for its high spatial and spectral information due to which the discrimination of materials is much more accurate and efficient. The useful information is extracted in Hyperspectral Imaging technology after applying it in agriculture, biomedical, and disaster management studies. A review comparison has been carried out for air borne images using hyperspectral acquisition hardware for classification as well as segmentation purpose. Numerous approaches that have been focused for implementation namely semi-supervised technique used for hyperspectral imaging using active learning and multinomial logistic regression, Generalized Composite Kernels (GCKs) classification framework, classification of spectral-spatial based data on loopy belief propagation (LBP), multiple feature learning of HI classification, and semi-supervised GCKs with classification accuracy on AVIRIS dataset (59.97%, 92.89%, 81.45%, 75.84%, and 95.50) and segmentation accuracies using α-expansion method as (73.27%, 93.57%, 92.86%, 91.73% and 98.31), respectively. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Internet of Things consists of several interconnected physical devices through the internet, whereas fog and cloud technologies are hosting tasks responsible for device controlling and management. Such an environment is significantly scalable, and its capacity to handle a large volume of data is proven. For this reason, we propose an IoT architecture featuring necessary technologies to cope with robot orchestration and monitoring. At the fog level, an IoT platform is deployed with all required features to monitor robots remotely. The modeled system in BIP has been wholly instantiated in a real infrastructure after formally checking and simulation against requirements by applying classical code simulation and statistical model checking. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Automated face and age recognition is becoming an important technology due to the huge amount of biometric transactions will be carried and processed daily by Authorization agencies. Now a days Estimation of human age is a very significant characteristic in terms of identity authentication. In order to assess one’s individual age, selection of features from the human face is significant and vital with the perspective of experimental accuracy. Some of the Real world Age estimation applications are Biometrics, Security management, 3D face construction and cosmetology. Statistical and regression based are the traditional and earlier techniques commonly used age estimation technique which works on results of interrelationship and correlation among the different values of age for face images. The current work is an enhancement of existing techniques used previously for feature extraction using Local binary patterns with regional features of 2D Wavelet transformation image and age estimation can be accomplished by using SVM Classifier. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The adoption of mobile technologies in education are evolving like in the business and health sectors. The design of user-centric platform to enable individuals participate in the activities of learning and teaching is currently area of research. The Learning Management Systems (LMS) area assists learners and academic activities but, it continues to fall short of desired impact due to huge demands of the application. More importantly, the mobile applications offer enormous convenience not without the possibility of eavesdropping and maliciously exploiting data about users. The original structure of mobile learning requires that data and processing heads have centralized entity, which is not possible in wireless application arrangements due to communication overhead of transmitting raw data to central learning processor. This led to the use of distributed mobile learning structure, which preserve privacy of learners. This study discusses the challenges, current trends, methodology, opportunities and future direction of privacy preservation in mobile-based learning systems. The study highlighted the use of learners’ private data and behavioral activities by LMS especially in understanding the needs of learners as well as improvement of their experiences. But, it raises concerns about the risks of learners’ privacy on LMS due the mining processes of learners, which were not considered in existing related studies in literature. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming research through analysis of massive datasets and accelerating simulations by factors of up to a billion. Such acceleration eclipses the speedups that were made possible though improvements in CPU process and design and other kinds of algorithmic advances. It sets the stage for a new era of discovery in which previously intractable challenges will become surmountable, with applications in fields such as discovering the causes of cancer and rare diseases, developing effective, affordable drugs, improving food sustainability, developing detailed understanding of environmental factors to support protection of biodiversity, and developing alternative energy sources as a step toward reversing climate change. To succeed, the research community requires a high-performance computational ecosystem that seamlessly and efficiently brings together scalable AI, general-purpose computing, and large-scale data management. The authors, at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), launched a second-generation computational ecosystem to enable AI-enabled research, bringing together carefully designed systems and groundbreaking technologies to provide at no cost a uniquely capable platform to the research community. It consists of two major systems: Neocortex and Bridges-2. Neocortex embodies a revolutionary processor architecture to vastly shorten the time required for deep learning training, foster greater integration of artificial deep learning with scientific workflows, and accelerate graph analytics. Bridges-2 integrates additional scalable AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and high-performance parallel file systems for simulation, data pre- and post-processing, visualization, and Big Data as a Service. Neocortex and Bridges-2 are integrated to form a tightly coupled and highly flexible ecosystem for AI- and data-driven research. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={It has been predicted that there will be an influx in the number of adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients over the next five years. This increase will add further strain to the currently overworked system. Patients with CF are required to meet with their Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) approximately every four months. If a patient has any health-related concerns in-between these appointments, they need to undergo a phone evaluation. These phone calls can be sporadic and require a member of the MDT to be on hand causing a strain on resources and time. The Virtual Doctor project aims to reduce this effect by creating an online evaluation service, where patients interact with the Virtual Doctor using speech recognition and speech synthesis technologies within their own web browser. The Virtual Doctor will work by generating a report from the patient’s visit which is then evaluated and sent to the MDT to action. The patient will also be given feedback from the visit which outlines when the team will be in contact. This paper will discuss the design requirements that need to be met for both the CF patient and the MDT, as well as the implementation of the Virtual Doctor tool. The tool has also been placed under a pilot study with 12 participants, where their experience using the tool was rated. The overall results were positive which shows that this tool may benefit both patients and medical staff allowing patients to learn about their own condition and health status while improving time and resource management. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) applied solutions are changing the way the world perceives technology. IoT devices are now being used in a wide range of applications to transfer or share relevant information, hence reducing human interventions. With such widespread IoT solutions, security becomes a significant concern. Many of the IoT devices are vulnerable due to several reasons, including in-secure implementations, poor life cycle management, and inappropriate configurations, leading to an increase in the risk of these devices getting exposed and attacked. However, the current security approaches for detecting compromised IoT devices are inefficient, especially for zero-day attacks. Since no one knows how a new attack would look like, it will be useful to monitor and detect anomalies using accurate detection techniques. This work probes the possibility of detecting IoT network traffic anomalies using novelty detection techniques; thus, it can detect compromised IoT devices. One of this work’s main contributions is developing an IoT anomaly detection system named Behavioural Novelty Detection for IoT Infrastructure (BND-IoT). BND-IoT trains a neural network with novel selected behavioural features extracted from benign traffic only and then uses the novelty techniques to detect any unusual traffic patterns. We show that the presented approach effectively detects anomalies within IoT devices’ network traffic with a robust average F1-score of 96.7% and a low false rejection rate of 7%. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Vehicular cyber physical systems (VCPS), by leveraging on advancements in sensing, wireless technologies and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) have improved driving experience and birthed systems like cooperative adaptive cruise control, and have formed the foundation for autonomous and platooned vehicles. However, its deployment is adversely affected by security concerns even as attackers continue to improve their attacks methods. In recent years, machine learning has become an invaluable tool for research, and investigations into its application in CPS security is increasingly active. Although, supervised learning techniques were used for most tasks initially, reinforcement learning due to the excellent results obtained in peculiar cases like the environment in which vehicles operate have become popular. Trust management systems are also very useful in identifying adversaries in a vehicular network. In this paper, a data-oriented trust-based method for improving the resiliency of vehicles to adversarial attacks is investigated using RL. Improving on other works that combine direct and indirect trusts and assume that vehicles interact for a long time, this method is suited for the dynamic environment vehicles operate in and the high mobility they experience. Specifically, the Q-learning learning algorithm is used to learn and adapt the weight used to estimate the trust value and therefore reflect the real environment. The simulation results obtained show that the proposed methodology is efficient and establishes the contributions of the application of RL to CPS security. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, Acsenda School of Management (ASM) in Vancouver, Canada was engaged in change management to integrate technology enhanced learning throughout its curriculum. But when the pandemic struck ASM, like many higher educational institutions (HEIs) worldwide, had to move all its programs and operations online, and vacate the campus in a short time, which called for crisis management. Based on surveys of students, faculty and staff carried out during and after the first term online, ASM responded successfully. ASM is now charting its future for the rest of 2020 and 2021, using the approach of change leadership. It is aimed at creating a resilient institution that will be able to thrive in the uncertain times that will follow COVID-19. Change leadership may also involve occasional recourse to crisis management, since new waves of infection could occur at any time and require operations to go back online at short notice. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Developing seamless smart parking solutions remain an active research area. User coordination burden remains high, and systems based on complex instrumentation are often expensive and costly to maintain. Contemporary parking lot management systems are slow to adopt new technology, particularly in cases where there is no perceived immediate return on investment. We propose the use of a low cost, low power, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based outdoor localization system coupled with a Random Forest classifier and dual-mode Bluetooth mesh network to provide space occupancy detection and sensor data transfer. To balance computational demands with cost, we leverage fog computing paradigms to shift computational capability near the sensor network where it can be used without an expensive network back-haul to a data center or cloud. We provide operational experiment results and analysis, and a study on the effects on accuracy from various network complexity and radio map minimization schemes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a technology that tends to address our present and future challenges in the IT world, such as the cost of hardware and its power consumption, storage sizes are becoming smaller in comparison with the large volume of data in recent usage (Big data), the cost and management of software and hardware etc. with the use of visualization technique. Cloud computing still faces lots of challenges, topmost is security and privacy of its data. Among of the data security challenges the cloud faces are data (breach, loss, retention, segregation and remanence etc.). But remanence which is the residue of data that still remains in storage after deletion, is a crucial challenge most especially in the cloud and has received minimal attention from the users and CSP (cloud service providers). Data breach and disclosure by unauthorized persons can occur in different forms among of which is improper disposal of data when it is no longer needed. We will be reviewing various work related to data remanence, its challenges, and its prospects. This will help and guide researchers, cloud users, and cloud service providers, etc., in knowing and understanding better this challenge that poses a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and authorization of data in the cloud environment. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Lack of processing capabilities, regular updates, or patch-up and constrained resources make the highly autonomous and interconnected system of the Internet of Things (IoT) into a convenient location for several security breaches. There is a tremendous increase in the rate of cyberattacks in recent years, which alarms the cyber security force to develop more enhanced solutions by adopting new technologies and resources as never seen before. Security services like intrusion detection, packet inspection, and firewall are provided as a service through cloud servers using virtualization and Software Defined Networks (SDN). In this paper, a group-based access control mechanism which centers on SDN embedded fog nodes is proposed to provide routing based access control for sensitive IoT applications. Further, a second level of verification is done by the device itself by adopting the existing Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Message Authentication Code (MAC) without any extra overhead. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The current centralized educational data management system results in problems like malicious tampering, low cost of diploma fabrication, and high cost of certificate verification. The start-of-the-art decentralized blockchain technology can be applied to solve the problems. In this paper, we reveal the shortages of current centralized systems and propose EduChain, a heterogeneous blockchain education data management system, which leverages the advantages of both private blockchains and consortium blockchains. We also propose an effective mechanism to conduct database consistency check and error traceback based on the second consensus via pt-table-checksum tool to solve the database mismatching problem. This system shows good performance in information verification, error traceback and data security. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of cloud computing technology, the traditional Business Process Management System (BPMS) begins to transform to the architecture that deployed in the cloud. Since the traditional BPMS is often implemented as a stateful single-instance architecture, the cloud BPMS providers will encounter the stateful service load scheduling problem when they refactor the traditional BPMS to the microservice architecture that deployed on the cloud server. In order to help realize the transformation of traditional BPMS and improve the load capacity of cloud BPMS with limited computing resources, we propose a heuristic load scheduling algorithm for stateful service scheduling. The algorithm makes use of the busyness metrics of the single BPMS engine instance microservice in the cloud BPMS architecture. Because the resource scheduling problem is always defined as online bin packing problem, we improve the Best-Fit algorithm to solve this kind of problem. We come up with the Best-Fit Decreasing algorithm based on cloud BPMS engine busyness measuring and load prediction to schedule the computing resources to business process instances. Compared to some common load scheduling algorithms, our algorithm help cloud BPMS increase load level by at least 15%. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={The transition of the power system to more decentralized power plants and intelligent devices in a smart grid leads to a significant rise in complexity. For holistic and integrated designing and testing of new technologies before their implementation in the field co-simulation is an important approach. It allows to couple diverse software simulation components from different domains for prototyping, but also to couple hardware devices in other testing approaches such as Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and remote laboratory coupling, which enable more complete, realistic, and reproducible validation testing. In the planning and evaluation of co-simulation scenarios, experts from different domains have to collaborate. To assist the stakeholder in this process, we propose to integrate on the one hand semantics of simulation components, their exchanged data and on the other hand domain knowledge in the planning, execution, and evaluation of interdisciplinary co-simulation based on ontologies. This approach aims to allow the high-level planning of simulation and the seamless integration of its information to simulation scenario specification, execution and evaluation. Thus, our approach intents to improve the usability of large-scale interdisciplinary hardware and software co-simulation scenarios. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities. Treatments aim to improve levels of functionality of patients with dementia. Some patients may experience catastrophic episodes during their treatment, these episodes are characterised by excessive emotions or physical response. Psychiatrists have used supportive tools and therapies to improve patients’ levels of functionality, trying to prevent and decrease catastrophic episodes. In this study, we present Memento, an application designed for catastrophic episodes management in patients with dementia through Information Technology. To develop Memento, we identified design aspects that should be considered when developing an application to reduce catastrophic episodes. Our main contribution is the classification of these aspects. To do this, we have analysed our findings in specifications which include the patient needs and characteristics; therapy guidelines; area or environment of interaction; dementia action protocol; and user interface navigation. Our findings may serve as guidelines for the design and development of interactive applications targeted at patients with dementia. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Communication is one important key to successful innovation culture within companies. We developed three lightweight formats to support innovation communication – future personas, describing the needs of future customers, anchorvideos, for giving technological trends “a face” and anchoring them within a company, and the InnoDeck for efficiently spreading innovative methods and inspiration in practice. In this work, we extend previous work on the three topics by describing how the three artifacts work together and can be combined within a company or in innovation networks. We show this in three case studies. Two describing how companies use the artifacts internally. A third case study from an innovation network shows concrete visualization of the combination of the three concepts. Additionally, we provide new evaluation results for the innovation communication within the network based on a questionnaire. Concluding, we illustrate how we will extend and interleave the concepts for supporting communities of practice in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The 5G network is the latest wireless mobile communication technology. Nowadays, the emerging of many network applications has led to a massive amount of network traffic. Many researchers have devoted their studies to the accurate prediction of network traffic applications. Network management requires technology for the prediction of network traffic without network operator intervention. In practice, 5G uses the Internet of Things (IoT) for working in high-traffic networks with multiple sensors to send their packets to a destination simultaneously, which is a feature of IoT applications. Therefore, 5G offers wide bandwidth, low delay, and extremely high data throughput. Predicting network traffic is more important for IoT networks to provide reliable communication. The efficient 5G network cannot be complete without including artificial intelligence (AI) procedures. Machine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to traffic prediction. In this paper, we implement the prediction of IoT traffic in time series using deep learning. The prediction accuracy has been evaluated using the (RMSE) as a merit function and mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Studies have shown the benefits of following Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) in the daily practice of medicine. Nevertheless, the lack of digitalization of these guidelines makes their update and reliability to be a challenge. With the aim of overcoming these issues, Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs) have been promoted to use in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Moreover, the implementation of Semantic Web Technologies (SWTs) to formalize the guideline concepts is a powerful method to promote the standardization and interoperability of these systems. In this paper, the architecture of a CIG-based and semantically validated mobile CDSS is introduced. For that, the development of a patient-oriented mobile application for the management of gestational diabetes is described, and the design and results of its usability assessment are presented. This validation was carried out following the System Usability Scale (SUS) with some additional measurements, and results showed excellent usability scores. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Living in a knowledge-based society, one of the most important tasks of decision makers is to know how to deal with information and knowledge that add value to their activities. Decision makers need to retrieve high-quality sets of information in order to gain competitive advantages in their business world. Otherwise, companies may struggle with several difficulties when it comes to market competition and business reputation. What-If analysis tools can help decision-makers in this matter. This technique allows for simulating hypothetical scenarios without harming the business and helping anticipate future events, by testing hypothesis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybridization approach and develop a hybrid methodology, which aims at discovering the best recommendations for What-If analysis scenarios’ parameters using OLAP usage preferences. We also develop a software platform to illustrate the hybrid methodology with a specific case study. This hybridization process will help the user during the design and implementation of a What-If analysis process, overcoming the pitfalls of the conventional What-If analysis process. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Hackathons are events that have become increasingly common around the world. This kind of event, described as a programming marathon, is based on problem-solving that can go beyond the technological boundary. This paper presents the findings of a global hackathon to aid its organizers to rethink their strategies to leverage the knowledge management of the teams to solve the hackathon challenges. Our research is a mixed research approach followed by ethnography based on a questionnaire, interviews, and observations. The findings point out that the organizers should consider four factors to rethink hackathons strategies to leverage knowledge management for the event: knowledge processes, resolving conflicts, individual learning, and experienced emotions. Moreover, our findings could inspire the tech industry to consider those factors to leverage the innovation and creativity in the team workers. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Agriculture 4.0 is the era of integrating intelligent technologies in agriculture. Problems such as low informatization, food safety, high management cost and imbalance between supply and demand in agriculture have greatly hindered the development of agriculture. The various properties of blockchain technology can make up for the lack of agricultural mechanism, and the fusion of the two is a hot issue in the application of blockchain. Blockchain technology has already had some application cases in the field of agriculture. Based on the research status of Chinese and foreign scholars in this field, this paper firstly introduces the basic overview of blockchain. Then, with agricultural supply chain and agricultural product traceability as the core, it describes the application of blockchain technology in the agricultural field, and further explores solutions to different application problems. Finally, combined with the practical application of “agriculture + blockchain”, relevant Suggestions are proposed to provide reference for cross-disciplinary research. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Building a national unified ISEMS (industrial internet security emergency management system) plays an important role in industrial cybersecurity defense. However, due to technical and management constraints, the current ISEMS has problems such as scattered security organizations, poor sharing channels, and fails to form an overall security guarantee capability for threat reporting, analyzing, warning, and disposing. The blockchain technology has the characters of decentralized trust construction, inter-organizational data sharing, data integrity assurance, data traceability, which just meets the requirements of the emergency management process. This paper analyzes the situation and challenges of ISEMS, describes the system architecture and organizational structure based on the blockchain, and describes the key implementation processes of blockchain-based ISEMS, including threat report, risk analysis, warning release and emergency response. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Sustainable development of megacities requires a transition to the new management methods and technologies, based on the wide use of a large amount of heterogeneous data. Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing. This paper considers the possibilities of using intelligent unmanned technologies based on UAVs for solving the problems of monitoring the urban environment of the Kazakhstan megalopolises. Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles. Furthermore, technological and economic issues, as well as necessary data processing technologies, are discussed. The economic effect of the use of IUVAT is estimated at $ 70-200 million, but it requires solving a set of data processing, control and technical problems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the deployment of smart grid technologies and management modernization, the large amount of fine-grained electricity consumption data become readily available. So, the process of knowledge extraction from such a vast amount of data should be optimized to efficiently and reliably utilize such information for future strategies making, network optimization and power system planning. In this context, we proposed a hybrid approach that combines decomposition algorithm with deep learning model for improved accuracy and reduced complexity. The approach adds an additional novel perspective to the existing studies by selecting appropriate prediction models on the basis of decomposed components intrinsic features. Experiments are conducted on the Australian National Electricity Market (specifically, Queensland) dataset and prediction results are compared to two different state-of-the-art decomposition based hybrid approaches. The comparison results are evidence that the proposed approach outperforms other decomposition based hybrid approaches by generating 1.63% average prediction error. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The importance of Treasury management, within a commercial bank has increased significantly over the last couple of years. After the 2008 financial crisis the role and responsibility of a Treasury department has changed in terms of scope and strategic importance, evolving from a transactional cash manager to the guardian of the balance sheet. In order to meet this broader strategic mandate, Treasurers must therefore consider ways to become more effective and streamlined, while reducing time-consuming operational activities. Digitalisation can address many of the traditional Treasury challenges and provide a number of commercial and competitive benefits as well. However, to successfully adopt digital technologies and related digital innovations, Treasury requires a well-defined digital transformation plan. The Smart Digital Treasury Model (SDTM) was developed to provide a comprehensive roadmap to assist a Treasury’s digital transition towards a next generation ‘smart’ Treasury department. This paper explores a key building block of the SDTM, which addresses the risks and threats that can arise from the adoption of new digital technology. The reason for focusing on this aspect is that many of the digital risks have no direct reference points with conventional banking activity or security measures. The result of this research is an approach that articulates Treasury specific digital risks and threats, as well as describes a risk management process that can be deployed as part of the digital transformation. The digital landscape is evolving the whole time; therefore, digital risk management activity in Treasury can’t be seen as a once-off exercise, but needs to evolve in line with market developments. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Under the circumstance of school closure due to the outbreak of COVID-19, one of the greatest challenges for the sudden transition from traditional face-to-face teaching to fully online learning lies in students’ inadequate capability in self-regulated learning (SRL). This study investigates how the first-year undergraduate students regulated their online learning in an EFL Small Private Online Course (SPOC) during the pandemic period. A revised version of Jansen et al.’s (2018) Self-regulated Online Learning Questionnaire (SOL-Q) is applied to collect information of the participants’ SRL ability. Results indicated that the participants’ overall self-regulated online learning ability was generally at an intermediate level, however there’s still room for improvement. Specifically, the participants demonstrated limited capability in respect of meta-cognitive skills in the preparatory phase and persistence. A positive correlation was found between metacognitive skills and time management. Teaching implications are provided on how to improve students’ metacognitive skills, time management and persistence in future online instructions. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Problem - Both summative and formative assessments are employed in the medical education. Summative assessment (SA) evaluates a student’s learning progress and provide concrete grades or pass/fail decisions. Formative assessment (FA) provide the feedback and improve the students’ learning behavior. However, it is less known about the impact of FA on student’s recognition construction. This study is to exhibit the effects and correlation of FA implementation on students’ cognitive performance in final SA at Jinan University School of Medicine. Intervention – FA based on teaching management platform - Rain Classroom were performed consecutively in two batches of clinical medicine students. Their scores of final SA constructed on Bloom’s taxonomy levels were compared. A questionnaire on the students’ learning activities and perceptions was surveyed at the end of each term. Outcome - The students’ academic performance in 2018 was not statistically significant improved at each Bloom’s taxonomy level after the first round of FA implementation, when compared to the students in 2017 who had been evaluated only by final SA. Further methods were taken to strengthen the students’ active learning, timely feedback from teachers and peers was supplied on Rain Classroom. After the second round of FA, although exhibiting no statistical difference compared to those of the students in 2018, the performance of the students in 2019 was significantly increased compared to the students in 2017 at the analyzing level. The survey manifested that FA and FA built-in feedback cultivated the students’ active learning effectively, reinforced higher-order thinking and problem solving skills which related to higher cognitive levels. Rain Classroom platform facilitates FA implementation. Conclusion – It is necessary that incorporating FA into the regular assessment system for optimal educational output. The development of cognitive abilities should be emphasized when designing the assessments methods. Our FA based on Rain Classroom provides an example for online assessments of blended learning. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={As a prevalent type of internet technology for social interaction and collaboration, social media have been increasingly used for educational purposes. This paper presents a review of the research work on their uses, benefits and limitations for teaching and learning in higher education contexts. It covers a total of 77 articles published from 2010 to 2019 which were collected from Scopus and Google Scholar. The uses of social media revolved around two major areas—as a learning management system and a means to enhance students’ engagement. The benefits of using social media covered students’ satisfying experience in collaborative learning, engagement in learning activities, real-time communication, and knowledge sharing, as well as communities of practice; and such benefits have been shown to have a relationship with the improvement of learning outcomes. The limitations covered concerns about blurring boundaries between public and private life and between teachers and students; the effectiveness for the construction of knowledge; a lack of pedagogical and technical skills; and compatibility with instructional design. The studies also reveal the changing role of teachers and their need to innovate teaching practices with effectively utilised features of social media. Finally, the results suggest future work to be done for promoting the educational use of social media and enhancing their effectiveness, such as support from institutional policies on technology-enhanced learning and the promotion of teaching innovations. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The traditional retrieval technology is difficult to grip users’ intention accurately and apace in massive and fragmented data. To organize fragmented knowledge in reason and retrieve useful knowledge to recommend for users in a big data environment, this paper proposes a label distribution learning-based semantic retrieval model on the knowledge graph. The model firstly constructs the knowledge graph based on the topic map model. And then it clusters knowledge by using K-means label distribution learning (KM-LDL) and reduces retrieval scope. To address the problem that the space vector converted from the input text is sparse, this paper improves K-means label distribution learning according to the idea of probability and constructs a semantic retrieval model on a knowledge graph based on Bayes-K-means label distribution learning (Bayes-KM-LDL). The experimental results show that the proposed model can organize fragmented knowledge more reasonably than the traditional retrieval approach and its accuracy and recall rate have good performance. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Communication base stations are spread all over the country. Manually managed communication base stations are not only inefficient but also waste a lot of manpower and financial resources. To improve the management and maintenance level of communication base stations, according to the actual requirements of environmental monitoring of communication base stations, the monitoring system is determined to be composed of remote monitoring units, server end, and client end. The MQTT protocol is chosen as the backbone protocol of the system architecture, and the wireless network is used to realize data communication between each other. Using embedded technology, a remote monitoring unit including multiple ZigBee node modules are designed to detect the environmental temperature and humidity, smoke, UPS voltage, image, and other parameters of the base station. These data are transmitted to the gateway through the module and then transmitted to the server through the coordinator. Server database management program to achieve monitoring data records, historical data queries, user management, and other functions. Android Studio is used to design the client program, which provides real-time data viewing, control command sending, and other functions, meeting the requirements of client data input and output processing. The results show that the system is stable, reliable, and suitable for the environmental monitoring and management of communication base stations. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables intelligent interaction and automated collaboration among industrial production factors (i.e., human, machine, thing, method and environment) to improve productivity and intelligent level of factory. The industrial intelligent control system is the basis for realizing IIoT. It can enable industrial production with the abilities of autonomous decision-making and system autonomy. As an extension and expansion of the industrial cloud platform capabilities, edge computing can support industrial intelligent control with low-latency, high-reliability, and high-security edge intelligent services. Combined with the ideas and technologies of edge computing, software definition and Cyber-Physical System (CPS), we propose the solution and framework of software-defined industrial intelligent control (SDIIC) to realize intelligent control based on edge computing from two levels of software and hardware. At the software level, we propose the scheme of industrial intelligent control oriented software-defined edge computing (SDEC) platform to realize the intelligent and flexible management and autonomous coordination of edge devices. At the hardware level, the architecture and key technologies of the software-defined edge controller are proposed. The software-defined virtual controller with differentiated control and computing capabilities is implemented on the general standardized hardware resources. It can support both real-time industrial control and non-real-time edge computing task processing. The SDEC platform and the software-defined edge controller enable the SDIIC solution to realize industrial system autonomy and intelligent control. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Nowadays, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are widely adopted in hospitals. Increasingly often medical devices are computer-assisted. Hospital Information Systems (HISs) are not designed to manage the huge amount of data produced by these devices. New paradigms, such as Cloud Computing, by means of its features represents a valid tool to handle this kind of problem. Cloud Computing is very powerful, but it arises issues concerning data privacy. For this reason, clinical operators are reluctant to adopt it in HISs. In this paper, considering two real use-cases coming from the IRCCS “Bonino Pulejo”, a clinical and research center in Messina, we discuss a Cloud Computing architecture able to manage amounts vast of medical data. From a technical point of view, the proposed solution is based on microservices each of them realized for performing a specified task, such as the anonymizer. A microservice that is able to obfuscate users’ sensitive data in order to assure data privacy and to make the system compliant with GDPR. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The work is devoted to mathematical modeling of the scenario for managing the sustainable development of coastal systems using the example of the Azov Sea. The dynamic problem of minimizing the costs of maintaining the ecosystem of the reservoir in a given state, which is interpreted as a requirement for sustainable development, is being solved. The mathematical model of the interaction of two phytoplankton types takes into account the influence of abiotic factors, such as salinity and temperature, on the algae growth, their absorption and excretion of nutrients, as well as the transition of these nutrients from one form to another. For the numerical implementation of the proposed interconnected mathematical models of biological kinetics, parallel algorithms have been developed that are adapted to multiprocessor and hybrid computing systems using the NVIDIA CUDA architecture. An analysis of the characteristics of the CUDA architecture showed the applicability of the algorithms for the numerical implementation of the developed mathematical models of hydrobiology to create high-performance information systems. The constructed software complex allows to simulate the problem of reducing eutrophication and toxicity of the coastal system under consideration by displacing harmful blue-green algae with a cultivated strain of green alga using high performance computing systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The heterogeneity of data in logistics processes is due to the use of different systems, standards and data repositories. The same information is codified differently making efforts to integrate data necessary. Information objects are typically used by different legacy systems and different standards may be applied in the global context of information flows. An information flow is a sequence in which each information exchange can be considered a bidirectional transformation of information between data formats, protocols and different rights & roles concepts of the different logistics artefacts. The high degree of heterogeneity means that implementing 1:1 interfaces for each logistics artefact is inefficient and not scalable. To solve this problem, a dynamic interoperability layer is proposed in this paper, with a wrapper component as part of each logistics artefact. The approach presented here is based on a conceptual level and a corresponding proof-of-concept is shown based on available technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the Advancement in Information & Communication Technology, there is an enhancement in Cloud based systems & mobile devices. With the increasing availability & usages of those device, huge data is flowing through various communication channels through different data sources. New demand from academic & industry includes analyzing generated data effectively to come up with fruitful insights that can be actionable either by systems or by humans. Main Goal is to go beyond the questions ‘what is happening’ and ‘why it has happened’ to those such as ‘what is needed in the future’ and ‘what are the recommended actions’. Data Lake, which is an extent to Data Warehouse & doing a great job in managing Big Data, providing answers to known questions. In this Paper we are describing issues with traditional data warehouse systems and challenges while managing Big Data with such systems. Also various challenges identified which occurs while understanding the interconnected Data stories in various Data repository and to prepare them for advanced analytics. A novel Data Lake architecture which could work as a Decision support system for Big Data Management has been provided after comparing with other existing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the past decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a part of our daily lives due to major advances in Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In spite of an explosive growth in the raw AI technology and in consumer facing applications on the internet, its adoption in business applications has conspicuously lagged behind. For business/mission-critical systems, serious concerns about reliability and maintainability of AI applications remain. Due to the statistical nature of the output, software ‘defects’ are not well defined. Consequently, many traditional quality management techniques such as program debugging, static code analysis, functional testing, etc. have to be reevaluated. Beyond the correctness of an AI model, many other new quality attributes, such as fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency, etc. become important in delivering an AI system. The purpose of this paper is to present a view of a holistic quality management framework for ML applications based on the current advances and identify new areas of software engineering research to achieve a more trustworthy AI. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays, waste becomes one of the main air pollution sources. In this context, Uberwasted app is studied and developed as a mobile app that allows volunteers to report and to take part in waste collection based on location based technology and deep learning algorithms. First, a waste data management system has been built to store waste photo and descriptions, which are submitted by using the app. Furthermore, waste are classified by applying convolutional neural network model called “Resnet34”, then reported to network of volunteers the place to be collected based on location based technology. To proof of our conceptual approach, several typical implementation results will be illustrated. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE or e-waste) is constantly growing worldwide as information and communications technologies (ICT) and electronics penetrate the market to satisfy society current needs. Development requires reducing the technological gap with the undesired consequent increment of e-waste. Inadequate handling and disposal of these residues poses a threat to environment and health, specially in developing countries. E-waste has been thoroughly studied worldwide; however, there is limited research about this topic in Ecuador and its municipalities. This case study focused on the current e- waste management system of the three municipalities of Santa Elena Province of Ecuador in order to propose improvements. Total WEEE generation and generation rates were estimated. Qualitative research methods were used to map the main stakeholders and to analyze the current waste management scheme. Literature review was performed, and field work included observation, interviews and surveys. Most of the stakeholders were approached during this study. The awareness and willingness of citizens to participate in campaigns and initiatives was evaluated. A comparison with other Ecuadorian cities is presented to tailor recommendations for municipalities. Two stages are suggested to improve the current scheme as the province faces many challenges closing open dump sites and including e-waste management in the current agenda. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The paper describes advanced information technology created on the basis of system methodology which uses methods and models of dynamic, probabilistic and statistical, regression assessment of financial risks, combined methods and models for missing and lost data recovery, methods of structural-parametric adaptation. Information technology is implemented in the form of client-server architecture, microservices and clouds. The main tasks in financial data analysis are research of the financial processes volatility and financial risk assessment. Proposed IT is flexible and adaptable from a practical point of view to both tasks and allows to include only the necessary resources and blocks with optimal use of the server and to integrate in the existing information system of the functioning enterprise (at the expense of the developed microservices which are connected to system if necessary, and implementing separate functions). In the paper the main stages and means for creating new information technologies for financial processes forecasting based on different regression models and dynamic financial risks modeling are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The research addresses to the animation studio services issues, advantages and disadvantages of their functioning, both for the ordinary user and the developer. It makes sense to provide the client with information about two areas: pricing policy and content of services. The services automation methods within animation studios are researched using modern methods of Data Mining. It is proposed to create the work logic using data mining methods, Decision Trees methods, for the animation studio management services effective functioning. It is determined that in case of client priority search criteria choice is related to pricing policy, it makes sense to organize the operation of the animation studio management service based on the backtracking algorithm. In the case of client’s search criteria choice priority are content-related topics of services, apply algorithms for constructing decision-making tree. It is proposed to solve the problem of comparing the services of different animation studios, their pricing policy, location, etc. by building a composite web application - data mashup of children’s animation studios. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={As the underlying technology of Bitcoin, blockchain has become increasingly mature in financial, medical, logistics and other commercial fields, and has great application potential in the marine field. Its “decentralized” feature can maintain data security and reliability through decentralized methods. Marine data management system is one of the specific application scenarios that blockchain technology is used to protect marine network data information. The consensus algorithm and decentralized idea possessed by the blockchain technology can effectively guarantee the information collaboration of the marine network, and help to improve the collaboration efficiency among multiple parties involved in the safe sharing of marine data. In this paper, according to the analysis of the construction demands of the marine data management system, based on the blockchain technology, a distributed cross-chain transaction, called the global blockchain, is structured, which integrates the marine data collaborative heterogeneous blockchain network. On this basis, aimed at the problems of the existing PBFT consensus algorithm, such as poor dynamic addition and deletion of nodes, and large communication overhead, etc., a global consensus algorithm adapted to the marine data global blockchain network is designed for optimization of the checkpoint mechanism and view change mechanism as well as reduction of the amount of transmitted information in these two processes of the system. The simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively guarantee the consensus efficiency and the trustworthiness of the proxy nodes, realize the efficient sharing of marine data, and support the design and implementation of the blockchain-based marine data management system. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Blockchain is a decentralized, trust-free distributed ledger technology which has been applied in various fields such as finance, supply chain, and asset management. However, the network isolation between blockchains has limited their interoperability in asset exchange and business collaboration since it forms blockchain islands. Cross-chain is an important technology aiming to realize the interoperability between blockchains, and has become one of the hottest research topics in this area. This paper proposes a cross-chain transaction model based on improved hash locking consulted by the notary and users, which can solve the security problems in traditional hash locking. It can prevent malicious participants from creating large traffic blocking channels based on the key of unlocking condition. At the same time, the scheme of notary multi-signature is designed to solve the problem of lack of trust in traditional model. The transaction process of cross-chain, key agreement, cooperation mechanism of cross-chain, and security analysis based on the model is given in detail. Experiments of cross-chain transactions are implemented in Ethereum private chain, and prove that the proposed model has good application abilities. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the video surveillance system has become an indispensable management tool for cities. The surveillance system can improve the effectiveness of management and supervision and reduce the possibility of crime. Video surveillance as a service is a type of cloud service that can reduce redundant information and communications technology (ICT) facilities. Users use video surveillance services through a publish/subscribe (P/S) model. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based publish/subscribe video surveillance system with fine grained access control. A P/S service model for the video surveillance is given and the matching efficiency is improved using a multi-level index mechanism. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is adopted to encrypt the access control policy for a published video surveillance, and only the subscriber with satisfied attributes can decrypt and subscribe video services. In traditional CP-ABE schemes, access policy is stored and granted by the cloud, which lacks credibility due to centralization. We use blockchain to record the access policy, realizing user self certification. The video received from the camera is encrypted and stored in InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) node connected to the blockchain network. The decrypted key of the video is encrypted by CP-ABE. Finally, the access policy, decrypted key, video metadata, the hash value returned by IPFS are recorded in the blockchain. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Effective communications among team members enable them to stay resilient and make rapid decisions when they are facing uncertainty and complexity during an incident with time and resource constraints. With the rapidly-expanding indoor positioning technologies that support public safety operations, a more efficient and effective building information platform is needed to support indoor location data visualization and coordination efforts. On the other hand, building information modeling (BIM) has been widely accepted in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry as a central repository of building information. BIM does not only include accurate geometric building data and sufficient semantic information but also could be integrated with real-time smart building data. The ultimate goal of this research effort is to bridge the technology gap between various emerging indoor positioning technologies and abundant building information and thus to overcome the main shortcoming of the existing indoor building model. A BIM-based Indoor Location (BIMIL) portal is designed in this work for automatic data extraction, visualization, and transformation of BIM emergency-related data for public safety purposes. Subsequently, the new generalized building 3D model can be overlaid with indoor positioning data to support emergency responses. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={DNA molecules can retain information in high densities, with high durability and low overall energy cost. This would make DNA-based data storage system a compelling solution in placating the increasing gap between global data production and our current means to store data. While key technical developments in recent decades have allowed DNA-based data storage systems to slowly progress closer to mainstream usage, there has been an overall lack of discourse surrounding potential implications of the system in the context of human computer interaction (HCI). This article introduces the DNA-based technology, followed by highlights of some of the potential opportunities and challenges it brings to the HCI community. In summary, DNA-based data storage systems offer a new research topic for user experience studies and data physicalization, and these are driven by inherent biological qualities of the DNA. As a tool, given the longevity of DNA, the system could also function as a multi-lifespan information management product, designed to help in addressing long-term wicked problems. In terms of challenges, ethical implications surrounding the technology ownership, and communication hurdles for HCI researchers working with the new technology, should also be considered and addressed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the present era, the prevalence of network technology and cloud computing capabilities for multiple owner model has drawn much attention. Data owners outsource their data to the cloud and enjoy convenient services. However, extending single owner model into multiple owner model still have some issues, such as dimension reduction issue, high communication overhead, and efficient search in Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) remain a challenging task. Integration of machine learning methods with the framework of searchable Encryption (SE) is a diverse way to solve these problems. In this paper, we developed Multi-owner encrypted ranked keyword search using Machine learning techniques(MERS-ML). Our Scheme utilized principal component Analysis (PCA) model to reduce high-dimensional data into low-dimensional codes and enabled low-overhead system maintenance. K-means clustering approach is used to solve the problem of the quality of different document of multiple owner model. To achieve fast query and efficient search relatively close to O(log N), we designed search balanced index tree. Besides, attribute-based encryption is used to achieve convenient key management as well as authorized access control. Compared with previous work, our scheme provide adequate privacy protection, improved search efficiency, and introduce low overhead on computation and storage. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Computer network intrusions are of increasing concern to governments, companies, and other institutions. While technologies such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are growing in sophistication and adoption, early warning of intrusion attempts could help cybersecurity practitioners put defenses in place early and mitigate the effects of cyberattacks. It is widely known that cyberattacks progress through stages, which suggests that forecasting network intrusions may be possible if we are able to identify certain precursors. Despite this potential, forecasting intrusions remains a difficult problem. By leveraging the rapidly growing and widely varying data available from network monitoring and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, as well as recent advances in deep learning, we introduce a novel intrusion forecasting application. Using six months of data from a real, large organization, we demonstrate that this provides improved intrusion forecasting accuracy compared to existing methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have fostered a widespread adoption of Machine Learning (ML) capabilities within many products and services. However, most organizations are not well suited to fully exploit the strategic advantages of AI. Implementing ML solutions is still a complex endeavor due to the fast-pace evolution and the intrinsic exploratory nature of state-of-the-art ML techniques. In many respects, the evolution of data platforms through highly parallel or high performance technologies have focused on the capacity to massively process the elements consumed by these ML models. This separate consideration renders reference architectures to be either suited for analytics consumption, or for raw storage. There is no joint consideration for the complete cycle of data management, models development, and serving with feedback and human-in-the-loop requirements. This paper introduces design criteria conceived to help organizations to architect and implement data platforms to effectively exploit their ML capabilities. The main objective of this work is to expedite the development of data platforms for ML by avoiding common implementation mistakes. The proposed guideline constitutes the methodical articulation of the empirical knowledge acquired over the last years designing, developing, evolving and maintaining a broad spectrum of relevant industry-oriented Data and AI solutions. We have focused on evaluating our proposal by assessing the functionality and usability of the architectures and implementations originated from our design criteria. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the applications of traffic congestion detection based on Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) are proposed and widely used. However, location privacy leakage has become a serious problem in traffic congestion detection based on traffic voting, because vehicles will upload traffic congestion information and their own locations to the traffic management server. In this paper, we propose a decentralized weighted vote traffic congestion detection framework, which allows vehicles can safely participate in the traffic voting, under location privacy protection, and accurately obtain the traffic congestion status of the road. Specifically, we introduce blockchain technology into traffic congestion detection, and apply smart contract to replace the traditional trusted third party. We propose a weighted voting scheme, and set the weight of votes depending on the distance between the vehicle’s current position and the location of congestion. The security analysis result shows that our framework can satisfy the above requirements. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate that our framework is efficient and practical. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Vital signs monitors in intensive and intermediate care units generate large amounts of data, most of which are not recorded nor taken advantage of. We propose a computer system that allows the automatic and early detection of the deterioration of critical patients, through the real-time processing and analysis of digital health data, including physiological waveform data generated by the medical monitors. Our system tries to emulate the behavior of an expert intensivist physician, giving recommendations for clinical decision making to reduce the uncertainty on diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis. In our previous works, we presented an real-time Big Data infrastructure built using free software technologies. In this paper we improve its data management. We present and evaluate three different data representation models in Apache Kafka. One of this models outperforms the other two in storage space use and delivery time of both real-time and historical data. Our results show that Kafka can be used for historical data storage. This in turn allows us to eliminate the NoSQL database of our previous system. Unlike other works, ours attempts to reduce the number of components to lower system overhead and administration complexity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With day to day exponential increase in the number of private vehicles, it is essential to communicate useful travel information for road travellers to plan their travel ahead. One of the recent technologies that aid in real time and faster communication is Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). There are several useful information that can be transmitted across the smart vehicle users of VANET infrastructure. The useful information may be related to vehicular traffic, safety measures or entertainment which requires authenticity, confidentiality, anonymity and availability. This paper proposes a secure scheme for such information in order to provide an improved road traffic management applications of VANET. In specific, the proposed model mainly focuses on: (i) a decision scheme to analyse the road traffic situation (ii) using Video Image processing based infrastructure coupled with VANET (VIMPROS-V) to enumerate and authenticate the information communicated during critical traffic situation. The proposed model is applied for real time Traffic Congestion (TraCo) estimation application and tested by simulating similar traffic conditions corresponding to a real time traffic video. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The paper considers the approach to building a personal assistant based on the open semantic technology (OSTIS). The key idea of our approach is the transition from processing a message in speech form to a formalized representation of the meaning in a knowledge base with the least number of intermediate stages. Knowledge base is built on the basis of a semantic network implemented using OSTIS technology. In this case, many tasks of the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic levels of natural language processing, for example, such as recognition of named entities (NEM) and definition of a part of speech (POS), dialogue management (intentions identifications and directives forming), can be performed directly in the knowledge base of the intelligent assistant. This will make it possible to effectively solve such problems as managing the global and local context of the dialogue, resolving linguistic phenomena such as anaphores, homonymy and eleptical phrases, correctly formulating answers to questions that are complex in structure and content, posed by the user during the dialogue. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Security aspects must be considered in the next generation of IoT and 5G networks. From the different aspects that can be considered that belong to the area of security, we focus in this work as core aspects, the processes of authentication and key management operations that are essential to establish security associations between end-devices and data services. However, little effort has been put so far into providing a network-independent solution for service access authentication in the field of constrained devices based on IoT such as LoRaWAN, NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M in 5G networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture based on EAP bootstrapping and AAA infrastructure for IoT and 5G networks to manage service authentication and security association in order to enable secure end-to-end communication. In this work, we propose the use of an improved bootstrapping mechanism for secondary authentication adapted to be compliant with the 3GPP specifications for integrating IoT technologies in 5G networks. We propose the adaptation of LO-COAP-EAP (Low-Overhead CoAP-EAP) as an EAP lower layer for enabling the secondary service authentication with high flexibility, scalability and networks independence. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The development of systems following model-driven engineering can include models from different domains. For example, to develop a mechatronic component one might need to combine expertise about mechanics, electronics, and software. Although these models belong to different domains, the changes in one model can affect other models causing inconsistencies in the entire system. There are, however, a limited amount of tools that support management of models from different domains. These models are created using different modeling notations and it is not plausible to use a multitude of parsers geared towards each and every modeling notation. Therefore, to ensure maintenance of multi-domain systems, we need a uniform approach that would be independent from the peculiarities of the notation. Meaning that such a uniform approach can only be based on something which is present in all those models, i.e., text, boxes, and lines. In this study we investigate the suitability of optical character recognition (OCR) as a basis for such a uniformed approach. We select graphical models from various domains that typically combine textual and graphical elements, and we focus on text-recognition without looking for additional shapes. We analyzed the performance of Google Cloud Vision and Microsoft Cognitive Services, two off-the-shelf OCR services. Google Cloud Vision performed better than Microsoft Cognitive Services being able to detect text of 70% of model elements. Errors made by Google Cloud Vision are due to absence of support for text common in engineering formulas, e.g., Greek letters, equations, and subscripts, as well as text typeset on multiple lines. We believe that once these shortcomings are addressed, OCR can become a crucial technology supporting multi-domain model management. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Digital Twins have emerged since the beginning of this millennium to better support the management of systems based on (real-time) data collected in different parts of the operating systems. Digital Twins have been successfully used in many application domains, and thus, are considered as an important aspect of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, their development, maintenance, and evolution still face major challenges, in particular: (i) the management of heterogeneous models from different disciplines, (ii) the bi-directional synchronization of digital twins and the actual systems, and (iii) the support for collaborative development throughout the complete life-cycle. In the last decades, the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) community has investigated these challenges in the context of software systems. Now the question arises, which results may be applicable for digital twin engineering as well. In this paper, we identify various MDE techniques and technologies which may contribute to tackle the three mentioned digital twin challenges as well as outline a set of open MDE research challenges that need to be addressed in order to move towards a digital twin engineering discipline. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The mobility of people and goods from one place to another point is mounting from time to time in both developed and developing world. This is as result of rapid urbanization and lead to economic benefit in order to secure better income and ease of mobility access. Cities are indeed engines for new jobs and could be able to provide safer and proper movement of peoples and goods. Recently many of developing countries are taking in to consideration the agenda of smart cities and mobility concept and all urban mass transport must operate on low renewable and low emissions fuel, to promote access to sustainable urban transport system. However, many challenges poses the positive impact of cities such as traffic congestion, air pollution, environment degradation, unplanned transport infrastructure, lack of integration of transport system, nonexistence of environment friendly technologies and solutions, lack of government/policy makers commitment, rapid increasing number of motorized vehicles and absence of predictive maintenance mechanism and intelligent parking management systems. Hence, transport telematics is currently emerging technological solution as part of sustainable transport system and connects many of vehicle structures with remotely connected communication devices and is ensuring smart mobility. The subject of this paper is mainly aimed to examine applicability of the innovative management solution of transport telematics technology for smart cities mobility and its environment. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Coronary artery disease is one of the most serious medical challenges of the 21st century. Thanks to the development of cardiology and medical technology, the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) has become more and more effective in recent years. According to European standards, electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed as soon as possible for every patient suspected of having a MI. Correct ECG interpretation is crucial for qualifying the patient for the appropriate treatment. If ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is diagnosed, the optimal treatment is primary coronary intervention (PCI) within 120 min since first medical contact with the patient. Patients diagnosed with STEMI should be transported directly to the hospital with the primary PCI program. In order to accelerate and facilitate the diagnosis of MI, telematic systems supporting the management of the diagnostic process have also been introduced for daily use. Lifenet 5.2 is the most common system operating for several years in Poland consisting of a number of transmitting stations (modems) located in ambulances that enable ECG transmission to the receiving station located in the catheterization laboratory, which allows immediate put to correct diagnosis. The modems are connected to defibrillators, which are necessary to perform an ECG and collect the patient’s vital signs. This paper describes the process of diagnosis and treatment of STEMI using Lifenet 5.2 in the realities of the Polish health care system with particular emphasis on the key role of the Emergency Medical System, shows strengths of the system, their impact on the development of cardiology and on decrease in mortality rates due to MI, as well as limitations and local problems during the everyday use of this system. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The article examines the transport management games as a way to increase the knowledge of drivers. The intellectual value (information, knowledge, innovation) is created by games providers, to satisfy target markets. The global, innovative firms have been using new tools to create relations based on knowledge-sharing, because global customers are more exacting, and they take decisions more knowingly. The aims of the paper are to show the preferences of drivers related to using different transport management games and to identify the process of knowledge sharing among drivers through transport games. It has been assumed that knowledge sharing among drivers through the transport management games enables creating satisfaction of game users (drivers). This study partially has an overview character. A critical analysis of the literature reports of research companies, as well as Internet sources is used in the study. Documentary methods are applied, and the results of qualitative research based on case study research are presented. Findings of this study indicate that using games can lead to successful increasing of drivers’ knowledge © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The increase in the level of urbanisation is associated with the dynamics of changes taking place in the world. The literature on the subject described the contemporary structure of society as an information society or a knowledge society. Common access to information resources and participation in their acquisition affects the use of knowledge resources in industrial systems. The development of the information society determines the availability of ICT solutions. In the era of the information society, changes in expectations towards the urban transport system have become significant. The complexity of transport processes has made it necessary to use telematics systems to enable effective management. The main purpose of telematics solutions in road transport is to eliminate transport congestion. The European Union and the member states are taking action to solve transport problems. Due to the information revolution and globalisation, special attention is paid to ensuring safety for road users. Prevention of transport and industrial disasters was set as the goal of the transport system development. The effect of the aforementioned activities is interest in the Smart Cities concept. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to ensuring safety for road users, including the use of Smart City tools. In particular, innovations created for the needs of road vehicle users are noticed. Designing, producing and implementing technology supporting the safety of vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, is becoming a problem. Many European cities create original propositions of good practices in this area. The article reviews the existing solutions of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of Smart City supporting pedestrian safety. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This solution is in the design phase, financed by the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, it will last from 2018 to 2021. This project intends to develop new sustainable components to reduce the speed of cars at pedestrian crossings. These elements have three main functions: power generation, safe signalling of pedestrian crossings and connection of pedestrian crossings with the environment. Generation of electricity will be possible thanks to the use of reliable materials and a customised design that must withstand passing vehicles [27].},

abstract={The number of road traffic accidents has been on the rise worldwide with severe impacts. Road transport risk management has been one of the most important issues in the transport systems during the last several years. Where new technical solutions have been developed towards ensuring road and driver safety. The paper is focused on the telematics concept for the integrated management of road transport risks. Firstly, all the potential risks and transport engineering problems were identified. A new comprehensive framework for managing transport risks was developed on the basis of information and communications technology (telematics, ICT). This framework contains advanced strategies and processes for successful transport risk management using telematics. The paper presents the efficiency of the proposed framework in improving road safety, preventing avoidable accidents and reducing the probability of critical accidents. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Fog Computing is a new paradigm which is meant to solve some new challenges in IoT like a wide-spread geographical distribution and mobility of the devices, multiple nodes, heterogeneity of the hardware capabilities and communication technologies. A Fog Computing Orchestration enables the control of multiple devices connected to the Fog Computing network. It offers some new application areas like a smart home, smart grid, smart vehicles, or health data management. Since security issues of both the Fog Computing and Orchestration are not fully explored yet, it poses different challenges. This review paper firstly aims to identify the Fog Computing security challenges as it is the environment for an Orchestration. It reviews some proposed Orchestration solutions as well. Secondly, Orchestration challenges are identified themselves by reviewing over 150 papers. The results suggest that security/privacy is among the top concerns. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This study discusses the development of a mechanism for assessing cyber risks in investment projects aimed at digitalizing industrial enterprises. The relevance of the study is determined by the increasing susceptibility of companies to cyber risks due to the introduction of innovations, as well as by the growing complexity and frequency of cyber threats. The study focuses on eliminating the methodological and functional problems of cyber risk assessment described in literature. The results include the development of a concept for the mechanism and its architecture, the structural and logical scheme of the mechanism, and the specifications of the blocks it comprises. The theoretical and methodological basis of the research is formed on the works of foreign and Russian researchers in the field of corporate finance, risk management and cyber security. When building the mechanism, risk control approaches were used to ensure an inextricable connection between the risk factors and the goals of a project. The following tools were used: (1) a bow-tie chart for risk identification; (2) statistical data analysis methods; (3) risk-oriented budgeting and simulation modelling using the Monte-Carlo method; and (4) the “Micromort” method for evaluating the probability distribution parameters. In comparison to analogues, the mechanism represents an integrated approach to risk management and ensures integration and coordination of risk management actions between project management and other information security services. It allows the confidence intervals of return on invested capital values to be calculated for a project with due regard of cyber risks at the planning stage, as well as to identify and prioritize the degree of influence the main sources of threats have, which, as a result, provides a comprehensive and objective assessment of cyber risks. The calculation data can be used by project managers to enhance risk management actions. The functionality of the mechanism includes the analysis of how individual cyber risks affect the goals of a project, consideration of correlations between risks, calculation of the expected, unexpected and critical level of losses and forecasting in circumstances where information is limited. These advantages make the risk assessment process dynamic, iterative, and reactive to the changes in the environment and to the appearance of new threats. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The dynamics of development of new markets determines the relevance of systemic studies of modern formats of business co-organization, including cooperative network interactions in value chains. The relevance of our study increases when we set the goal of analyzing the role and features of large-scale use of digital technologies in the practice of businesses. Transitioning to cooperative network interactions based on digitalization can significantly change the practices and technologies of functioning, both of individual enterprises, their network associations, and industries as a whole. The article analyzes the trend of the desire of business entities to cooperate in the value chain and the development of cooperative network interactions on the example of the food market. We demonstrate that all small and medium enterprises and households actively use various digital technologies in procurement, sales, relations with the state and business communications. Accelerating all business processes through digitization and computer data processing as a result of basic innovation during post-industrial development creates new opportunities, qualitatively different from the previous ones, and requires significant changes in management, interfirm and interpersonal relationships, policies of states and organizations. Our research confirms the active transition to a new cooperative network type of economy based on digitalization and the leading role of business striving to achieve competitiveness using new tools and resources with the active participation of stakeholders. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper presents a new approach to analyse cybersecurity challenges and opportunities, focused on the development of a new risk assessment and management framework. Such a multi-sector assessment framework should be able to evaluate and prioritize cybersecurity risks in trans-sectoral and inter-sectoral contexts. It leads toward proper resource allocations and mitigation actions. To achieve this goal, the analysis of existing risk assessment and management frameworks was performed. Also, an overview on common multi-sectoral technological challenges and opportunities were provided being derived from sector-specific use cases as well as transversal and inter-sectoral challenges and opportunities. As a result of this analysis the architecture of the ECHO Multi-sector Assessment Framework was proposed. The identified technological challenges and opportunities, multi-sector dependencies, and transversal aspects determine the input data for the new framework. The architecture is applicable in healthcare, energy, maritime transportation, and defence sectors, being extensible to others. The framework enables the definition of governance models or the design of cybersecurity technology roadmaps. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

The three-dimensional operating room allows users to watch medics perform surgery from different, individually chosen, points of view. For the first time, it is possible to reproduce/repeat the course of the operations and change the perspective or position, from which it is observed. Here, we proposed a solution based on Microsoft HoloLens and Azure Kinect DK devices as remote support to patient management. The operating room is transferred to the digital form in real-time using Augmented Reality based technologies. Users can move around the digital place like a ghost in real space. The approach proposed allows users to see observe surgery from any point of view they want without disturbing the surgeon’s workflow. They can change their positions, angle, and place of observation. All environmental restrictions disappear. The presented solution gives trainees a convenient opportunity to learn. It may make a significant contribution to improving the surgeon training, patients’ outcomes, and may allow virtual medical consultations during the surgery between specialists without them leaving their workplace. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The increasing reliance of economy, society and state on cyberspace and proliferating cyber risks require not only technologies and qualified workforce, but also innovative organisational solutions. The European Union sees one such solution in the establishment of a network of cybersecurity competence centres. In the past two decades, the creation of collaborative networked organisations in other fields has proven its utility in sharing knowledge, resources and risk to exploit quickly emerging market opportunities. The major challenge in creating networked organisations is to provide long-term, effective collaboration through adequate governance and management. To support the elaboration of a solid governance model of a cybersecurity competence network in a Horizon 2020 research project, this paper presents the results of a study of 92 existing network organisations active in cybersecurity and closely related fields. It outlines the implemented methodological approach, the identification of two main types of business models depending on funding streams and degree of coordination among partners, a prioritised list of governance requirements, and prevailing governance models depending on member representation on senior governance bodies and decision-making principles. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The Software-Defined Network is a new network architecture, which changes the traditional network management mode, decouples the traditional network control layer and data layer, and realizes more convenient network management by building a common interface between each layer, with the advantages of openness and centralized management. However, the existing research usually focuses on the development of software defined network technology, but ignores many security problems. Software defined network contains many security problems of traditional network, but also produces some special security problems. According to the network architecture defined by software, this paper analyzes the unique security problems faced by the network defined by software, and classifies the security problems. From the aspects of improving controller security, denial of service attack defense, flow rule consistency and improving application security, some existing security solutions and development directions are listed. Finally, the current and future security challenges of Software-Defined Network are summarized, and the future research direction of Software-Defined Network security is prospected. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Dispatching the operation order is the cornerstone and foothold of the dispatching work, and is also an important guarantee and measure for power safety production. With the expansion of the construction scale of Guangdong Power Grid, the operation and management of power grid dispatching operations is becoming more and more complicated. The contradiction between the relatively decentralized service status of power grid operation and the integration characteristics of power grid operation has become increasingly prominent. As the complexity and frequency of scheduling orders increase significantly, the resulting economic losses are huge. In view of the above problems, the provincial-integrated dispatching operation robot designed in this paper realizes intelligent graphics ordering, graphic simulation preview, audit, operation order execution anti-error check, program operation and other functions by scheduling semantic recognition technology. Through the visual management of the land-saving scheduling operation cockpit, it is equipped with the functions of real-time operation risk perception of the whole network and real-time operation big data analysis of control system equipment status perception. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Due to the rapid growth in the number of urban vehicles especially electrical bikes and electrical cars, the dispatch management and safety issues of electrical bikes have become increasingly critical and prominent. With the development of IoT communication technology, traditional wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiFi and GPRS have some shortcomings for examples short communication distances and large power consumption. However, LoRa wireless communication technology has the advantages of long communication distance and low power consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes the remote monitoring vehicle system for electrical bikes based on LoRa wireless communication technology. The system consists of electrical bikes terminal and a remote monitoring center. The electrical bikes terminal adopts the architecture association of ARM, GPS and LoRa to complete the acquisition and wireless transmission of electrical bikes position information. The GPS module provide the position information, and the ARM transmit the location information to the monitoring center by LoRa wireless communication. The remote monitoring center is based on QT and GIS technology to complete the real-time display of the electrical bikes. The actual test results show that the system can meet the monitoring requirements, the communication quality is reliable, the communication distance is long, and it can be displayed in real time, dynamic and real scene. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In wireless sensor networks, radio frequency identification (RFID) is one of the key technologies for data transmitted by the sensor node. In the RFID system, tags convert RF energy to DC through antennas and rectifying circuits, and supply power to other circuits. The sensor and signal conditioning circuit require high energy, so it is difficult to make the sensor node work normally by using the traditional energy harvest and power management circuits. Moreover, since the power management circuit is charged and discharged at the same time, when the converted RF energy is close to the energy consumed by circuit, the sensor and signal conditioning circuit may not work normally. In order to improve the performance of the power management circuit of the sensor node, a succinct power management circuit based on double capacitance is proposed in this paper. Compared with the classical commercial BQ25570 devices, the proposed power management circuit is easier to realize and integrate into the sensor node chip, thus reducing the power consumption of the sensor node. In the paper, the different charging time constants of two capacitor circuits are used to provide power for the subsequent circuits after enough energy is collected. This mode of operation enables the sensor nodes to work stably. The proposed circuit is succinct and easy to implement, and the energy transfer efficiency is about 87% after the capacitor is charged. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Blockchain technology develops rapidly, which has a broad application prospect in solving security problem of the Internet of things (IoT). However, IoT devices with limited computing resources cannot afford high computing cost of blockchain mining. To solve this problem, edge computing is introduced to improve resource allocation efficiency in trusted IoT network based on blockchain. Therefore, IoT devices can choose to offload tasks to edge servers or local collaborative mining devices. Moreover, to maximize system revenue, a two-stage auction strategy is put forward to reasonably allocate computing resources in blockchain network. In the first stage of auction strategy, computing tasks can be offloaded to edge server, and the second stage realizes resource allocation of collaborative mining devices to utilize idle computing resource adequately. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy performs better than linear search algorithm in terms of effectiveness and rationality. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={To manage (such as configuring and monitoring) the numerous network chips and its ports efficiently, the in-band management technology is used in the interconnect network of high performance computing systems. However, with the rapid development of network switching chips towards the higher radix, the traditional in-band management implementation of ring structure faces the problem of delay performance scalability. The work proposed two optimized implementation structures for the in-band management, four-quadrant double-layer ring and four-quadrant star ring to solve the problem. The results of resource consumption assessment and delay performance simulation showed that in the high-radix switching chips with 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, and 160 ports, the occupancies of LUT (Look Up Table) resources of the four-quadrant double-layer ring and star ring structures increased by an average of $$5.46\%$$ and $$1.71\%$$ compared to the traditional ring structure, respectively. Meanwhile, the occupancies of LUTRAM (Look Up Table memory) resources increased by an average of $$30.89\%$$ and $$21.81\%$$; that of FF (Flip Flop) resources by an average of $$3.86\%$$ and $$0.19\%$$; the forward delay of management packets decreased by $$25.75\%$$ and $$21.81\%$$, respectively. Considering both resource consumption and delay performance, the star ring was an ideal structure to deal with the problem of delay performance scalability among the in-band management structures, which can be applied to realize the in-band management for the higher-radix switching chips in the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={Technical Debt Management (TDM) is a fast-growing field that in the last years has attracted the attention of both academia and industry. TDM is a complex process, in the sense that it relies on multiple and heterogeneous data sources (e.g., source code, feature requests, bugs, developers’ activity, etc.), which cannot be straightforwardly synthesized; leading the community to using mostly qualitative empirical methods. However, empirical studies that involve expert judgement are inherently biased, compared to automated or semi-automated approaches. To overcome this limitation, the broader (not TDM) software engineering community has started to employ machine learning (ML) technologies. Our goal is to investigate the opportunity of applying ML technologies for TDM, through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the application of ML to software engineering problems (since ML applications on TDM are limited). Thus, we have performed a broader scope study, i.e., on machine learning for software engineering, and then synthesize the results so as to achieve our high-level goal (i.e., possible application of ML in TDM). Therefore, we have conducted a literature review, by browsing the research corpus published in five high-quality SE journals, with the goal of cataloging: (a) the software engineering practices in which ML is used; (b) the machine learning technologies that are used for solving them; and (c) the intersection of the two: developing a problem-solution mapping. The results are useful to both academics and industry, since the former can identify possible gaps, and interesting future research directions, whereas the latter can obtain benefits by adopting ML technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The interest in quantum computing has grown exponentially in recent years, with large technology companies engaging in the creation of computers and quantum technologies. The number of qubits skyrockets and makes the future practical implementation of mathematical algorithms and the creation of commercial systems increasingly viable. However, the growth of hardware is not being accompanied by programming and engineering methodologies adapted to this new paradigm, with new needs and risks. Associated with this, we are also in a world in which current development projects are carried out in multiple paradigms associated with different needs. In this paper, our findings and proposals are defined to anticipate the future needs of quantum software project management, taking into account the new roles, requirements and deficiencies of this new technology. Specifically, we focus on defining a classical-agile hybrid project management framework that can be adapted to the needs of these new programming paradigms, taking into account not only quantum programming, but projects that integrate classical-quantum hybrid developments. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Deep learning technology is widely used in industry and academia nowadays. Several kinds of objects are involved in deep learning workflows, including algorithms, models, and labeled datasets. The effectiveness of organizing and understanding the relationship among these objects determines the efficiency of development and production. This paper proposes OMProv, which is a provenance mechanism for recording the lineage within each kind of object, and the relationship among different kinds of objects in the same execution. A weighted directed acyclic graph-based version graph abstraction and a version inference algorithm are proposed. They are consciously designed to fit the characteristics of deep learning scenarios. OMProv has been implemented in OMAI, an all-in-one deep learning platform for the cloud. OMProv helps users organize objects effectively and intuitively, and understand the root causes of the changed job results like performance or accuracy in an efficient way. The management of deep learning lifecycles and related data assets can also be simplified by using OMProv. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the cloud computing environment, with the complex network environment, the virtualization platform faces many security problems. At the same time, trusted computing can greatly enhance the architecture security of virtualization platform systems, but there are many problems when trusted computing is deployed directly in the cloud environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a trusted virtual machine model based on high-performance cipher coprocessor to solve the security problems such as the isolation and insufficient performance of virtual TPM (vTPM) on the existing virtual platform. In this model, virtio technology was used to realize the virtualization of TPM, and a management architecture was designed to manage the life cycle of vTPM. The analysis shows that the model can complete the isolation of vTPM, and protect the security of vTPM during the migration process through the migration control server, and can strengthen the security of the virtualization platform. Finally, the simulation results show that the model is more feasible and suitable for cloud platform than hardware TPM. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Guaranteeing the safety of equipment is extremely important in industry. To improve reliability and availability of equipment, various methods for prognostics and health management (PHM) have been proposed. Predicting remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial equipment is a key aspect of PHM and it is always one of the most challenging issues. With the rapid development of industrial equipment and sensing technology, an increasing amount of data on the health level of equipment can be obtained for RUL prediction. This paper proposes a hybrid data-driven approach based on stacked denoising autoencode (SDAE) and similarity theory for estimating remaining useful life of industrial equipment, which is named RULESS. Our work is making the most of stacked SDAE and similarity theory to improve the accuracy of RUL prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated by using aircraft engine health data simulated by commercial modular Aero-Propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS). © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the promising technologies for tackling issues of modern cities by creating a massive world-wide network of interconnected physical objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. IoT-Enabled Smart City Buildings today vulnerable to several types of hazards. As IoT and its enabling technologies allow sustainable development of smart cities, one of important IoT applications in modern cities is providing emergency management. Today, there are quite view emergency evacuation systems have been developed to reduce loss of people and increase survival rate during any hazard. However, during the process of evacuation, avoiding people congestion along paths and emergency exits is crucial. This paper proposes an IoT-based Congestion-Avoidance Emergency Evacuation Approach that can be easily integrated into smart buildings. It relays on three types of nodes to perform different evacuation tasks. Simulation shows the proposed approach avoids congestion by evacuating evacuees through less-congested paths. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the large-scale application of advanced information and communication technologies such as wireless communication and Internet of Things in the smart grid, the threat of viruses, Trojans and hackers from the Internet is becoming more and more serious. Compared with the traditional power grid, the more complex access environment, flexible access methods and a large number of access terminals in smart grid bring new challenges to data security protection. Existing data encryption and access control schemes are difficult to meet the actual needs of data leakage prevention in all aspects of smart grid. This paper proposes a smart grid data leakage prevention system architecture based on label and strategy, focusing on the design and implementation of data leakage prevention system for smart grid from the perspective of unified data management platform, terminal and network data leakage prevention. The system design architecture and scheme proposed in this paper can help solve the data security protection of smart grid data from transmission to storage, and has important practical reference value. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Lattice-based Identity-based encryption (IBE) can both simplify certificate management and resist quantum attack in the real world. Combined Public Key (CPK) technology can be used to enhance the efficiency of IBE schemes. In this paper, we use CPK to construct a more efficient lattice-based IBE scheme based on a variant of learning with errors (LWE) problem, by avoiding complex trapdoor generation algorithm and preimage sampling algorithm required by the existing lattice-based IBE schemes from LWE. Its storage cost is also lower. We show that our IBE scheme is semantically secure against an adaptive chosen plaintext attack (CPA) from all probabilistic polynomial time adversaries in the random oracle model. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This social context being decisive for any project’s success or failure, it proposes a Social Network Analysis (SNA) based approach to identify, visualize, and systematically analyze project stakeholders, their personal roles and attitudes towards the project, as well as their mutual interrelationships. This approach has been implemented as an extension to the naviProM methodology and toolset published earlier by the authors. Based on the analysis of an innovation project case study in a complex corporate environment, the proposed approach is explained and validated. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Due to digitalization and disruptive innovations, many established companies are faced with the task of adapting their business models and processes to new requirements. To avoid risks and exploit opportunities, spin-offs are founded for this purpose. The research question to be answered is if spin-off strategies can be based on a general form and if measures can be clustered. For this purpose, literature was evaluated and interviews with experts were conducted. In this way a structured approach could be developed, which is based on four result clusters: reasons, arguments, differentiation and success factors. The results are particularly interesting for the management of spin-offs and for companies that want to set up one. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the digital era, innovation power and speed have become the lifeblood of every successful industrial organization. While driving forward and managing innovation has been a subject mainly related to top-level decision makers and innovation managers for a long time, increasingly many organizations realize that this is inappropriate for keeping pace with the rapid changes in today’s societal, economic and ecologic context. Instead, leveraging and pushing innovation from bottom-up by mobilizing the creativity and diversity of the entire workforce has become the lingua franca of innovation in the digital era. An essential part of an organization culture fostering the democratization of innovation is the appropriate empowerment of the workforce through the understanding of essential drivers of change as well as the key innovation megatrends that are about to transform society. This position paper attempts to compile a comprehensive set of skills qualification programs ought to cover, which are aimed at empowering a workforce to act as innovation agents on all levels and organizational positions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Blockchain technology is ready to revolutionise the financial industry. The financial industry has various security challenges (e.g., tampering, repudiation, denial of service, etc). The Corda platform provides suitable technological infrastructure to build the blockchain-based application (CorDapp) in the financial industry to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we take a case of the capital market post-trade matching and confirmation process to perform security risk management. We compare the countermeasures of centralised application and CorDapp that mitigate the security risks. Furthermore, we explain what security risks appear within the CorDapp. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Increasing integration of electrics/electronics into modern products has led to a significant change in development processes and value creation of formerly mechanically oriented industries. With rising share of information technology in vehicles both product functionalities and customer benefit increase, which requires fundamental changes in the development and manufacturing processes. Due to the fact, that modern cars include a significant and still increasing share of mechatronics systems involving mechanical, electrics/electronics and software components, a smart and effective integration of these historically often separated disciplines plays an important role throughout the entire product lifecycle. To enable this integration, development processes as well as applied tools and methods are changing, which requires comprehensive skills of the involved human resources including management, engineers and a range of other concerned parties. The present publication discusses the progress of technology change in the automotive industry and the associated requirements on the applied development processes. Based on these, a comprehensive automotive mechatronics training programme is introduced, which addresses the needs of knowledge enhancement by know-how transfer between the different involved engineering disciplines. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={As we are witnessing nowadays with self-driving vehicles and robots performing collaborative tasks, and as it has been witnessed in the past, a disruptive technological innovation may cause a regulatory disruption. As a consequence, established regulatory frameworks need to evolve and, in this evolution process, regulatory excellence is paramount for guaranteeing appropriate risk taking, enabling innovators to innovate while efficiently complying to proportionate regulatory frameworks. In risk management theory, or better, in risk taking theory, Taleb has proposed the Barbell strategy, characterised by maximal certainty/low risk on one extreme of the barbell, and maximal uncertainty on the other extreme, as a means for developing anti-fragility, i.e., ability to gain from disorder. In this paper, we propose our vision consisting of a Barbell strategy-oriented regulatory framework and compliance management, where regulators and manufacturers/innovators, both, adopt a Barbell strategy for reaching an optimal solution in regulatory making, the former, and compliance management, the latter. Finally, conclusion and perspectives for future work are also drawn. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Whenever a new database technology appears, several comparisons also come up to attest that the new database technology is better than the traditional relational one. Even more, an outstanding performance is shown quite often by conducting performance comparisons. This paper attempts to illustrate that these performance comparisons should be taken with a pinch of salt. Revisiting published statements about comparisons between the Neo4j graph database and relational systems, we investigate several causes why relational systems show a worse performance. One possible reason is – among others – applying a default database configuration or configuring the system inadequately. Next, most tests are implemented in a straightforward manner, particularly not considering alternatives or applying useful features. In order to support our findings, we use a PostgreSQL database and implement some scenarios that are commonly used in comparisons. Thereby, we invalidate some stated results about the bad performance of relational systems in those scenarios. Concluding the discussion, we present some general considerations how fairness of comparisons can be improved. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The technologies for the use of augmented reality are maturing more and more and seem to offer many possible applications. There is also a lot of research and development in the industrial and business environment to increase productivity, improve communication or minimize errors. This work focuses on the use of augmented reality in the cooperation between spatially separated operators working on a common task. AR is intended to present spatial information to the operator being instructed, thus relieving the operator of tasks involving spatial orientation. In a study that is currently being planned, we want to find out whether the use of AR can support the operator in a search-and-rescue scenario at sea and thus reduce the time needed to perform tasks. AR will be compared to the way information is presented on traditional displays. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Population explosion in India has led to an outburst of some major concerns, one of which is the waste generation and disposal system. India is accountable for producing 12% of the global municipal waste. As a result, waste is collectively dumped irrespective of the type leading to drainage blockages, pollution and diseases. In this paper, we have proposed a model for waste segregation that uses neural networks to classify waste images into three categories namely recyclable, non-recyclable and organic. A training accuracy of 83.77% and testing accuracy of 81.25% was obtained. Along with the proposed neural network, five standard CNN architectures – VGG-16, Dense-Net, Inception-Net, Mobile-Net and Res-Net are also tested on the given dataset. The highest test accuracy of 92.65% was obtained from the Mobile-Net classifier. The paper also proposes an on-site waste management system using 8051 micro-controller and GSM technology. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Blockchain has been applied in a wide range of industries, including the financial sector. However, little is known about its adoption and usefulness in industries operating within developing countries. Moreover, while some studies have focused on the financial sector, the Asset Wealth Management (AWM) industry remains relatively unexplored. This preliminary study has identified factors influencing the adoption of blockchain in the AWM industry in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Through a qualitative exploratory study, perceptions of AWM experts were gathered on how blockchain adoption is influenced by the technology’s compatibility, complexity and relative advantage. The influence of the South African context was also explored. A preliminary framework is being proposed that will inform an in-depth, longitudinal study on blockchain adoption and use within AWM organizations in South Africa. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Demographic change represents the most significant challenge of the 21st century. The aging population around the world will foster a consequent change in labor markets, wealth distribution, request of goods and services, as well as social and healthcare needs. The number of survivors to once deadly conditions, as well as the age associated increase in degenerative chronic conditions will represent a severe stress to our systems, that will not be sustainable any longer. At the same time, longevity might become an opportunity for the re-organization of services, leading to a new era of opportunities for economic and social prosperity. These challenges require a strong interdisciplinary approach in the identification of unmet needs, and new social, health and technological solutions, that are demand-driven and user-oriented. ICT is going to be the key to many of these revolutionary services. The European Community has proposed a new grant instrument to foster the collaboration between public administration and ICT industry for purchasing Research and Development services in order to develop a novel Information and Communication Technology solution, called Pre Commercial Procurement. ProEmpower is such a project aimed to enable patients to early diagnosis, daily management, and clinical data collection for people with type 2 diabetes. The project goes through a call for tenders issued by a consortium of four public procurers, that jointly defined a set of requirements and use cases, in collaboration with end-users, for the development of innovative solutions This manuscript describes the process that has led to the selection of two solutions that will be tested by end users in the four regions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to become as common as electricity (OECD 2016) and there is a high probability for connected homes to become central parts of critical societal. IoT technologies might access, manage and record sensitive data about citizens and, as they become more and more pervasive, unintended data breaches reports increase every week. However, most of the tools designed to protect users’ privacy and personal data on IoT devices fail to contemplate the experience of persons with disabilities, elderly and other vulnerable categories of people. As a consequence, they are forced to rely on the help of family members or other related persons with technical skills, as frequent technical problems turn out to be the rule rather than the exception. With humans traditionally considered to be the “weak link” in technological networks there is the need of a vast educational project to raise awareness on the subject. This ongoing research paper aims to fill the existing gap in research by asking how humans deal with the risk factors linked to connected homes and how to develop a universally designed set of tools for everyday risk management in connected homes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Intelligent systems are becoming increasingly complex and pervade a broad range of application domains, including safety-critical systems such as e-health, finance, and energy management. Traditional approaches are no longer capable of addressing the demand for trust and transparency in these applications. Hence, the current decade is demanding intelligent systems to be autonomous, and in particular explainable, transparent, and trustworthy. To satisfy such requirements, and therefore to comply with the recent EU regulations in the matter (e.g., GDPR), intelligent systems (e.g., Multi-Agent Systems - MAS) and technologies enabling tamper-proof and distributed consensus (e.g., Blockchain Technology - BCT) are conveying into reconciling solutions. Recently, the empowerment of MAS with BCT (and the use of BCT themselves) has gained considerable momentum, raising challenges, and unveiling opportunities. However, several ethical concerns have yet to be faced. This paper elaborates on the entanglement among ethical and technological challenges while proposing and discussing approaches that address these emerging research opportunities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Nowadays companies have become highly dependent on digital technology for running their business, regardless their size or domain. Smaller organisations require a specific attention because of their lower level of protection, capability of reaction and recovery while they are increasingly being targeted by cyberattacks. In order to improve their level of cybersecurity and resilience, a first step is to raise awareness. It is however not an easy task because it is highly dependent on human factors, spread across the whole organisation, including managers, business users and IT staff. This paper aims at supporting the development of a cybersecurity awareness program for small and medium enterprises. In order to build the program on strong foundations, the current state of awareness of such companies is presented and a SWOT analysis carried out. Different instruments for efficiently supporting the deployment of the program are then presented. A practical experience carried out in Belgium to implement some of the proposed instruments is also presented and some lessons learned are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Because of the increase in the number and scope of information security incidents, proper management has recently gained importance for public and private organizations. Further challenges in this area have resulted from new regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS), as well as a tendency to outsource vital services to subcontractors. This study addresses the lack of empirical studies in the field and focuses on information security incident management at information technology (IT) consulting firms. Specifically, it examines challenges due to their exposed position and new regulations. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it provides valuable insight into the experiences and challenges of Swedish IT consulting firms. Second, it proposes criteria for classifying an information security incident that can equip decision-makers with a solid and assessable basis for incident management. The results emphasize further improvements in employee awareness, incident classification, and systemic governance, thereby integrating corporate policy making, information security incident management, and information system leadership. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper presents an attack and defence modelling framework for conceptualising the security of the speech interface. The modelling framework is based on the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop model, which has been used to analyse adversarial interactions in a number of other areas. We map the different types of attacks that may be executed via the speech interface to the modelling framework, and present a critical analysis of the currently available defences for countering such attacks, with reference to the modelling framework. The paper then presents proposals for the development of new defence mechanisms that are grounded in the critical analysis of current defences. These proposals envisage a defence capability that would enable voice-controlled systems to detect potential attacks as part of their dialogue management functionality. In accordance with this high-level defence concept, the paper presents two specific proposals for defence mechanisms to be implemented as part of dialogue management functionality to counter attacks that exploit unintended functionality in speech recognition functionality and natural language understanding functionality. These defence mechanisms are based on the novel application of two existing technologies for security purposes. The specific proposals include the results of two feasibility tests that investigate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in defending against the relevant type of attack. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Blockchain technology is having certain attributes like security, integrity and data preservation without the intervention of third party and in resultant; it provides its usage in various applications. Blockchain is an emerging technology in this era. Blockchain has gained prominence due to its highly secured features. Blockchain, as the name suggests, is a chain of blocks. Blockchain technology is made secured by incorporating the features of cryptographic hash. Each block maintains a hash value. Further, this hash value also depends on all the previous blocks. All the blocks are connected like a linked list. A single block contains a cryptographic hash of previous blocks, a timestamp and transaction data. A block is represented as a merkle tree root hash. All the blocks follow the same structure, only the data varies. The major application of blockchain due to which it has gained popularity is Bitcoin. Here, in the proposed research work, we would like to discuss various applications of Blockchain Technology like finance, academics, medical sciences, Intellectual Property Rights and how it is impacting the lives of people in day-to-day life. This paper focuses on the application of blockchain. Along with it, a comparative statistical literature review has been presented. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Recent advancements and applications in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have highlighted the need for explainable, interpretable, and actionable AI-ML. Most work is focused on explaining deep artificial neural networks, e.g., visual and image captioning. In recent work, we established a set of indices and processes for explainable AI (XAI) relative to information fusion. While informative, the result is information overload and domain expertise is required to understand the results. Herein, we explore the extraction of a reduced set of higher-level linguistic summaries to inform and improve communication with non-fusion experts. Our contribution is a proposed structure of a fusion summary and method to extract this information from a given set of indices. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, we provide a case study for using the fuzzy integral to combine a heterogeneous set of deep learners in remote sensing for object detection and land cover classification. This case study shows the potential of our approach to inform users about important trends and anomalies in the models, data and fusion results. This information is critical with respect to transparency, trustworthiness, and identifying limitations of fusion techniques, which may motivate future research and innovation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays included into an increasing number of critical systems. Inclusion of AI in such systems may, however, pose a risk, since it is, still, infeasible to build AI systems that know how to function well in situations that differ greatly from what the AI has seen before. Therefore, it is crucial that future AI systems have the ability to not only function well in known domains, but also understand and show when they are uncertain when facing something unknown. In this paper, we evaluate four different methods that have been proposed to correctly quantifying uncertainty when the AI model is faced with new samples. We investigate the behaviour of these models when they are applied to samples far from what these models have seen before, and if they correctly attribute those samples with high uncertainty. We also examine if incorrectly classified samples are attributed with an higher uncertainty than correctly classified samples. The major finding from this simple experiment is, surprisingly, that the evaluated methods capture the uncertainty differently and the correlation between the quantified uncertainty of the models is low. This inconsistency is something that needs to be further understood and solved before AI can be used in critical applications in a trustworthy and safe manner. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices produce large volumes of data, which creates challenges for the supporting, often centralised cloud infrastructure that needs to process and store the data. We consider here an alternative, more centralised approach, based on the edge cloud computing model. Here, filtering and processing of data happens locally before transferring it to a central cloud infrastructure. In our work, we use a low-power and low-cost cluster of single board computers (SBC) to apply common models and technologies from the big data domain. The benefit is reducing the volume of data that is transferred. We implement the system using a cluster of Raspberry Pis and Docker to containerize and deploy an Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark data streaming processing cluster. We evaluate the performance, but of trust support of the system, showing that by using containerization increased fault tolerance and ease of maintenance can be achieved. The analysis of the performance takes into account the resource usage of the proposed solution with regards to the constraints imposed by the devices. Our trust management solution relies on blockchain technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Along with the rapid development of Internet information technology, the field of network information technology has become more and more widely applied, and it is followed by the ‘‘big data era’’. Under the development of big data era, enterprises cannot leave the Internet and information technology applications on the road of sustainable development, but the competition relationship between enterprises is increasingly prominent, and the development prospect of enterprises is not smooth, which is a development environment where opportunities and challenges coexist. In development, enterprises usually use Internet computer technology for information transmission and data preservation, so there must be secrets in the enterprise website that affect the continuous development of the enterprise, once stolen, Will bring fatal impact to the enterprise. Therefore, the network information security in big data’s era needs to be guaranteed. This paper mainly studies how to use effective security risk monitoring and protection measures to remove the hidden dangers of network information and ensure network security management based on big data background. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In order to promote the development of wearable device informatization and solve the problem of frequent lost of the elderly, we attempt to research an anti-lost intelligent tracker based on Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology. It covers functions such as remote acquisition and data storage of multi-sensor node information from sensors. The system collects environmental information and health information in real time and transmits them remotely to the IoT cloud platform through NB-IoT technology. The real-time position of the elderly can be taken on the map in APP. The experimental results show that the APP can indicate the specific location of the target on the map in real time and the environmental information in the meanwhile. Through monitoring the health information, the health status of individuals in the environment can be timely known to ensure safety. This paper develops an anti-lost intelligent tracker which uses NB-IoT technology to replace WiFi and Bluetooth. We use NB-IoT technology to achieve data aggregation and long-distance transmission to IoT telecom cloud platform. Compared with other devices on the market, the proposed system has the characteristics of low-consumption, power management and endurable continuous positioning. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The emergence of electronic textbooks as a means of teaching in the real educational process of the school and university necessitates scientific research in the field of their design and application. These scientific researches, which are currently conducted in didactics, psychology, information technology, computational mathematics, are inherently polydisciplinary, since didactic problems are solved by means of other scientific directions. At the same time, there are all prerequisites for conducting interdisciplinary research, the subject of which can be an electronic textbook. The purpose of this article is to substantiate the need for interdisciplinary research in the field of building electronic textbooks. In the main part of the work, the specific mathematical algorithms implemented in practice in the programming of the e-textbooks of the learning management system of the Moscow Aviation Institute are described. New mathematical approaches to designing an electronic textbook, in particular, a graph-oriented approach, are proposed. The model of forming a time-limited test is considered, where the weighted convolution of the normalized values is carried out by an optimization criterion: deviations of the test complexity from a given level and quantiles of the test execution time. The modern software technologies are used in the development of mathematical algorithmic module. In conclusion, we described the effectiveness of the joint research of specialists from different scientific fields, which has been confirmed by the practical implementation of this project. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Modern science heavy relies on the usage of information technologies (IT). It is important to organize knowledge transfer from IT specialists to non-IT and to less educated and/or skilled IT ones. Nowadays a speed of IT development (as well as achievements of the results these IT are used for) can be sufficiently increased by joining efforts and resources of cooperating organizations, which solve similar tasks. An important aspect of such cooperation is an experience exchange and knowledge transfer, which can be obtained by participating in conferences, seminars, workshops, master classes, etc. That article provides information on the activities around a cloud infrastructure created at the Laboratory of Information Technologies of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR). It describes a purpose of its creation, implemented features, use-cases and training events it is used in. A relevance of the JINR and its Member State organizations clouds integration based on the DIRAC middleware is described too. Particular attention is paid to a process of knowledge transfer from JINR colleagues to fellows of other participating institutions through the organizing and holding of seminars, schools, conferences, round tables as well as semestrial training courses for students. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Several wearable devices are available in the market they are becoming increasingly popular. These devices have been used for scheduling, time management, energy prediction, as well as for health management. Our thorough analysis of the literature has revealed that the majority of the studies focus on investigating the usefulness, accuracy, or adoption of the devices. However, no study has been conducted to evaluate the perception of these wearable devices among its users. To that end, in this study, we have used the end-user feedback in natural language to evaluate the perception of Fitbit-Alta-HR, which is an award-winning and widely used wearable device. The study reveals that majority of the users talk positively about the device. Furthermore, we have performed experiments using three supervised learning techniques to evaluate their effectiveness for classification. The studies show that state-of-the-art Artificial Neural Networks is the most effective technique, and unigram is the most suitable feature. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Efficient utilization of the IoT generated data helps in the decision-making process as well as the realization of the concept of smart cities into a reality. The smart cities utilize Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to facilitate smart vehicles to operate independently without much human intervention. The ITS system utilizes the data produced by the smart infrastructure to intelligently operate the smart vehicles and make highly precise decisions in the whole smart city ecosystem. Although ITS has been in its evolutionary phase, this is the right time to realize the vulnerabilities present in the ITS infrastructure that can be exploited by the adversaries to render devastating attacks. The ITS network involves highly sophisticated infrastructure where any anomaly provokes threat to human lives. The ITS data can be manipulated by the adversaries for attacks such as password theft, information spoofing, data manipulation, information loss, eavesdropping, and key fob attacks. Blockchain provides a distributed and tamper-resistant technology by utilizing a privacy-preserving ledger to secure data in an efficient manner. The Blockchain technology eliminates the adversarial impact of the attackers by leveraging the computational capabilities of the trusted nodes in the network. In this research, we provide a secure framework for effective implementation of ITS using Blockchain technology in the centralized management of software defined networking. This framework utilizes edge computing where Blockchain provides security services. This framework is secure, provides interoperability, less information leakage, and seamless integration between versatile smart vehicles and service infrastructure. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In the field of image analysis, technological evolution is considered as an innovation through the application of algorithms in cameras for the detection and identification of objects and people, although these recognition tasks are complex for a computer. The general context of the application of the algorithms in the recognition of images is not known, therefore, the following research question is posed: What algorithm based on Viola-Jones allows the recognition of the image of a person? The objective of this investigation is to determine an algorithm based on Viola-Jones that allows to detect and identify the image of a person. This research was made through an algorithm comparison methodology, which allowed improving the recognition of a person’s image pattern, based on the techniques and methods found in pattern recognition. The results obtained will serve as support for future studies, considering that the application of the Viola-Jones-based algorithm allowed the recognition and identification of a person’s face in five different frontal perspectives, through a digital camera and was a fundamental basis to determine substantial improvements in the recognition of the image of a person. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The network’s functions virtualization emerges as one of the most promising technologies for the management of the new generation of internet. In recent years, computer and communication systems evolved enormously at influencing the development of network infrastructures in terms of scale, programmability and dynamic management. On one hand, the number of connected devices grows exponentially with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and multiple online applications. On the other hand, the diversity of proprietary protocols and programs does not allow the evolution of new network architectures with dynamic requirements. The scientific community has focused efforts on optimizing the administration of networks with the implementation and redesign of configurations techniques to improve the performance. The integration of a new emerging technology such as the Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows a flexible, dynamic and adaptable management by optimizing network resources in the proposed framework. In an IoT environment, we develop a testbed platform, which allows us to evaluate the orchestration of an implemented distributed SDN controllers in order to achieve scalability and flexibility management. Based on the simulation results, the developed SDCIOT architecture shows some performance metrics and the effectiveness management of large scale-networks. The SDCIOT framework includes a fault tolerance system with distributed SDN controllers. This study presents the development of an IoT framework to manage scale and distributed system using the network’s functions virtualization. Finally, some of the most important future research directions are highlighted and the development of new IoT applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Several of those works are the outcome of international collaborative research projects, funded by the European Union or other international institutional agencies, under the ‘Framework Programme 8’ (also called ‘FP8’ or ‘Horizon 2020’), which started in 2013 and is going to be completed in 2020. This paper therefore takes some main outcome of those projects, but not only, to provide a short overview of main 5G aspects and related work, planned in the 3GPP standardization body. Some of the touched-upon outcomes of those projects will be instrumental to build the foundation for the new technology enablers that will characterize the successor of FP8, i.e., the forthcoming new research programme FP9, at the moment tentatively also called ‘Horizon Europe’, which will run in the time window 2020–2027.},

abstract={The development of massively parallel sequencing technologies enables to sequence DNA at high-throughput and low cost, fueling the rise of metagenomics which is the study of complex microbial communities sequenced in their natural environment. A metagenomic dataset consists of billions of unordered small fragments of genomes (reads), originating from hundreds or thousands of different organisms. The de novo reconstruction of individual genomes from metagenomes is practically challenging, both because of the complexity of the problem (sequence assembly is NP-hard) and the large data volumes. The clustering of sequences into biologically meaningful partitions (e.g. strains), known as binning, is a key step with most computational tools performing read assembly as a pre-processing. However, metagenome assembly (and even more cross-assembly) is computationally intensive, requiring terabytes of memory; it is also error-prone (yielding artefacts like chimeric contigs) and discards vast amounts of information in the form of unassembled reads (up to 50% for highly diverse metagenomes). Here we show how online learning methods for sparse non-negative matrix factorization can recover relative abundances of genomes across multiple metagenomes and support assembly-free read binning by using abundance covariation signals derived from the occurrence of unique k-mers (subsequences of size k) across samples. The combinatorial explosion of k-mers is controlled by indexing them using locality sensitive hashing, and sparse coding and dictionary learning techniques are used to decompose the k-mer abundance covariation signal into genome-resolved components in latent space. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The relationships between preschool, employment and economic productivity, as well as cost-benefit studies in this field, show a potential high return on investment in the early years of childhood. Preschool is the main base of the educational structure according to the Peruvian Ministry of Education. However, investment in this type of education is on average about 250 soles ($77) per student. On average there is one teacher per 18 students and just 60% of these teachers are specialized in preschool education (Escale 2015). In this context, talking about equal opportunities have been contradictory because these kinds of students have been part of the population that has not generated productivity in the country. On the other hand, when talking about the productivity of people, this could have a direct correspondence with the innate capacity that people have (Cerquín Cortez 2017), which are call like intelligences according to Howard Gardner in the theory of seven intelligences. Could you imagine that we can detect these intelligences in the first years of a child? This gives us an opportunity to improve our abilities in the coming years. For several years, student abilities have gone unnoticed because of curricular education and even now continue to remain the same. Although there are current methodologies designed for the diagnosis of these types of intelligences in early education, this could go unnoticed given the inexperience of the teacher and excessive workload as well as the need of psychologists for its proper application. In contrast, increasing the use of technology could be to our benefit. This work proposes the development of a cognitive tutor to diagnose the types of intelligence in preschool aged children in rural areas with teachers without an educational degree and little to no presence of psychologists. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={In this work we proposed an indoor location system that makes use of a mobile phone and WiFi signal levels to determine the location of a person in the museum “Eduardo de Habich” at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería, Peru. Therefore, by determining the location, additional information such as recommendations, multimedia, an more could be shown to each user in order to have a better user experience. The main advantage with similar indoor location systems such as Beacons or RFID technology is that the proposed system does not require additional hardware as it only uses pre-installed WiFi hotspots. The experimental tests show promising results, achieving a location accuracy of 93.61%, which is useful for similar navigation tasks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) and Facility Management (FM) industry is under pressure to move towards technological innovations as well as sustainability. New technologies are of great importance to sustainable design and construction processes by providing the means to act efficiently. Building Information Modeling (BIM) as the state-of-the-art technology in the industry provides a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics and information resources of a facility by forming a reliable basis to manage the processes and decisions during its entire life cycle. Despite the opportunities and potential advantages of BIM in sustainability for certification and decision-making, there are still challenges of integrated and collaborated systems. This paper addresses a more flexible and dynamic object-oriented approach for successful sustainable project deliveries. The aim is to provide a guideline through the development of an automated solution based on industry foundation classes (IFC) and a multi-agent system (MAS). The proposed approach comprises of three main phases, which are (1) development of sustainability assessment database and library, and extension of the criteria concerning the sustainability assessment methods into BIM software via property sets, (2) generation of the BIM model and its conversion to ifcXML and XML file formats and (3) evaluation of the data and presentation of the potential alternatives by extracting the related data from the converted file. It will support effective decision-making throughout the complete building life cycle by offering the possible criteria selection according to the user-provided project properties and certification level target. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The construction sector has difficulty in catching the rapidly developing technology era. While the sectors are rapidly adapting themselves to the new era, firms that do not invest in innovation lose their value at a fast pace. When we look at the Fortune 500 list, it is seen that the biggest leap is made by companies in the IT sector. However, the situation is observed to be the opposite for construction companies. Despite the enormous investment costs and the huge risks involved, construction companies are unable to compete with the leaders of the digital world and falling down in the list. The losses of time and cost are increasing in the construction sector which lags behind in the digitizing world. The systematic analysis of these losses with analytical methods remains limited and there are problems in project management approaches. The industry today invests into digital transformation with Building Information Modeling (BIM) to deal with these problems in the construction sector and to produce a solution according to their dynamics in the digital world. BIM is the digital twin model of actual construction consisting of data-rich 3D objects. Accurate management of a data-rich model is possible with data management techniques. In order to fully benefit from this digital reflection of construction projects, the sector needs to establish processes based on basic theories of digital data management. This study is designed to provide a methodology in which the BIM 4D and 5D processes are handled as integrated and business intelligence approaches. While approaching Information Modeling from Building perspective, some basic approaches to data science have been integrated with 4D and 5D processes. The main objective of the study is to contribute to the digitalization process and to present a proposal for the application of the business intelligence in BIM processes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={This paper presents an in-depth enquiry for a case in the current condition of BIM implementation in Turkey. The research study is based on the specific collaborative experiences of an architectural design firm and a contractor firm on a large scale public construction project. It seeks to address the requirement for comprehending the idea of integrated project delivery provided with the collaboration opportunities of the BIM technology. It intends to demonstrate how the fields of policy and process interlock in the BIM activity of the selected case. It also aims to exemplify the handicaps of partial BIM implementation in a complex building production process. The research methodology is content-analysis of the in-depth interviews with the managers of the current production process from both architectural and contractor firms. Questions were designed to gather case-specific data in relation to the four fundamental features of the 3rd generation production process defined by Cooper [4]. The research findings indicate that although the production requirements fit the 3rd generation process, it is constrained by the public procurement law in force. It seems evident that there is a tension between the traditional workflow and the integrated process with increased productivity and quality that BIM enables and requires. This results in a noteworthy ratio of resource waste that the contractor has to compensate in this specific case. This study contributes to the ongoing research and discussion on the drawbacks of BIM implementation, by illustrating the requirement for the redefined and rearranged roles and processes of production with a precisely guaranteed resource economy and increased quality of work equally for all parties. It presents an example case for BIM implementation and process management to illustrate the current state of the public construction industry in Turkey. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

We proposed an agile methodology for the project management approach, acquired the necessary equipment and services and hired the staff to design and develop a monitoring platform in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with edge frameworks and technologies. We implemented a software working solution composed of five applications (app) or services and configured services in the GCP: IoT data web service, frontend web app, backend web app, IoT app, and mobile app. They were developed using Python, ReactJS, and Java and deployed in Google Cloud Platform for being used in personal computers, laptops, mobile devices, and IoT devices. We defined this architecture with its main basis in a cloud platform that used the publish/subscribe pattern for efficient data ingestion and reporting. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Many companies in Ecuador are managing the opportunities and risks that digital transformation represents. To help them to better understand how to address this challenge, we describe the strategic options that 94 companies, which are among the 500 largest companies in Ecuador, have adopted to implement those independent aspects that digital transformation demands. With a quantitative-deductive approach of a descriptive type and based on a corporate digital transformation framework, we design a set of variables that senior management can use as guidelines when planning a digital transformation strategy. The results obtained yield important definitions and findings of the performance of senior management in relation to the challenges of business transformation. This work contributes to the knowledge of those who must make strategic decisions in particular business contexts to overcome the complexities of strategic business transformations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={At present, precision agriculture involves a set of technologies for the optimal management of soil and crops to improve productivity. Banana cultivation is one of the leading export items in the province of El-Oro in Ecuador. However, most of the sprinkler and gravity irrigation systems used there are controlled by a manual operator. All of these raise the cost of operation and waste of resources, such as water and labor. Also, human errors and the inaccuracy of water control in irrigation generate stress on plants, and therefore, their growth and increase in humidity pests are affected. This work proposes a Smart Irrigation Control Panel (SICP), based on the Internet of things, as part of a SCADA system for automation of irrigation control of said crop, in the experimental farm “Santa Inés” of the Technique University of Machala. The SCADA proposed, has a dashboard, available in the IOTMACH cloud of the university, for real-time monitoring of the process variables and the remote control of the solenoid valves used for irrigation, an IoT gateway implemented in a Raspberry Pi 3 and a SICP installed in the field. The SICP is responsible for compiling the variables of temperature and humidity of the environment and the earth, water pressure, acquired through motes based on Arduino Mega. A radio link with Wimax technology was used to communicate the SICP with the cloud, to publish the variables mentioned. The tests of electrical continuity, insulation, and performance performed, allowed to verify the correct functioning of the entire system and the interaction time between the SICP, Gateway, and the IOTMACH Cloud. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In today’s world Internet-of-Things (IoT) is creating fascinating applications by providing the common platform for different domains. This paper proposes an IoT based Multi-Sensor Data Acquisition System to control, monitor and manage different devices together for the application of smart agriculture. The system is designed to measure some of the important parameters related to the crop yield such as soil moisture, temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity. It provides an automated irrigation to crop based on the data obtained from different sensors. In addition, the present system provides an added future for monitoring data and controlling the irrigation system in real-time without losing data during transmission. The irrigation system can be controlled from any location through a mobile phone in two ways one is automatic and the other one is manual control. Further, it is made to provide ease of operation and doesn’t require the knowledge of modern technology for the same. The developed system is very economical and it makes use of solar energy to increase the autonomy of embedded and its associated devices to provide perpetual operation. The aim of the system is to improve the crop yield by the effective use of natural resources. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={In this era of technology, the main causes of accidents among motorized vehicles are the sudden slowdown of traffic in highways and hilly areas are characterized by failure of signals, poor law enforcement, and bad traffic management. As a result, it’s lead to more traffic congestion which becomes a major issue for governments, scientists and Vehicle manufacturers. Road safety through vehicle control is the primary interest of the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) studies. Such problems can typically be mitigated by installing on highways that associate with defined traffic sensors the mobile app of drivers through latest communication network, but needless to say, however, not all streets are fitted with such types of equipment in hilly regions. Unfortunately, such accidents occur usually on the road, causing serious injury and death, infrastructure damage. In this regard, vehicular communication is being altered into a new thought named as Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Therefore, Internet of Things (IoT) concept is used to reduce human loss, to avoid or prevent traffic accidents at an extreme level and rather for road safety for an IoV system. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={In the domain of Big Data, the company’s supply chain has a very high-risk exposure and this must be observed from a preventive perspective, that is, act before such situations occur. As a company grows and diversifies the number of suppliers, customers and therefore increases its number of daily transactions and associated risks. Despite the innovation and improvements that have been incorporated into financial management, credit and debit cards are the main means of exchanging cash online, with the expansion of e-commerce, online shopping has also increased number of extortion cases that have been identified and that continues to expand greatly. It takes a lot of time, effort and investment to restore the impact of these damages. In this paper, we work with machine learning techniques, used in predicting smart supply chain fraud, are valuable for estimating, classifying whether a transaction is normal or fraudulent, and mitigating future dangers. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to improve people’s quality of life through the use of information technologies. Due to the critical nature of AAL systems, quality is a priority. However, as AAL is a relatively new domain, its main limitation is the lack of consensus and standardization in quality assessment. This work presents a systematic review to determine the state of the art on the quality assessment of AAL systems from a multidimensional vision (software product, in use, data and context). Initially, 1308 primary studies were extracted, from them 21 relevant studies related to models, frameworks, taxonomies and other approaches of quality assessment were selected after applying the corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected studies were subject to a comparative analysis that determined the most recurrent and critical quality attributes for AAL systems, being an important contribution to generate consensus in the construction of more complete quality models. Furthermore, this work allowed to recognize the strengths and limitations of the quality proposals studied and to identify research gaps and challenges. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Currently, various sectors including industry, health, academia and others, are facing huge challenges regarding the fast I.T. development, and more broadly, the IoT (Internet of things). The renewable energy sector is not exempt from this new paradigm: for example, an application for monitoring the photovoltaic panel system integrated with a green roof will offer the opportunity to improve resources and energy efficiency. This requires a structured approach to integrate all the elements involved in this context; and although the established technology exists, there is not a methodology to build platforms that integrate hardware and software and can interoperate effectively. Therefore, this document presents a methodology under an enterprise architecture approach, to design and implement an IoT-based service platform for monitoring a photovoltaic system integrated with vegetation. A case study is presented where the developed concept is applied. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The present study contributes to the improvement of the processes of conventional agriculture that are still being carried out independently of the Information and Communication Technologies, which show shortcomings in the forms of irrigation carried out suffering an impact on the use of the water supply. From this point, precision agriculture becomes indispensable to improve the processes of agricultural production processes, allowing adequate management of agricultural plots supported by the use of technology to estimate, evaluate and understand the variations of the variables involved and offer quantities of water necessary for cultivation. This analysis covers the design and construction of an intelligent irrigation system based on fuzzy logic applied in vegetable crops. The fundamental mechanism of this system is to realize the control of irrigation through a scheme consisting of two modules, the data acquisition module, and the decision-making module. Considering that the section with the highest degree of responsibility is the integration of fuzzy logic as a control mechanism and that is part of the decision-making module. To achieve this, meteorological variables such as precipitation, temperature, the humidity of the environment and soil moisture are evaluated, which are considered as input variables for the diffuse system. The operation of the prototype is crystallized in a functional graphical interface and tested in two scenarios, where its efficiency in the proper use of the water supply is demonstrated. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the advancement of technology and unlimited access to information through the Internet, traditional teaching models are evolving to become centralized in the student. The objective is to offer personalized education that overcomes any spatial-temporal barrier, achieving a continuous transfer of knowledge. However, under this scenario arises the need for equipment with high performance hardware and software. On the one hand, educational institutions, in most cases, do not have enough capital to migrate to new infrastructures; while, on the other hand, students encounter problems linked to licensing and lack of own resources. Overall, this translates into an impediment for teachers to design innovative activities. Hence, the concept of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDIs) is born, which relies on cloud computing techniques to provide access to remote machines pre-configured according to different storage, processing, network and software requirements. This paper presents an open source VDI solution based on OpenNebula, since the costs associated with using the services of large cloud providers could represent a considerable investment. Among the tests carried out, a pilot experiment stands out that demonstrates the benefits of deploying local VDIs, as well as a comparison of the savings they represent in relation to commercial solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet, the application of the Internet of things and big data is more and more extensive. The era of Internet of everything (IoE) has come, and the traditional cloud computing model has been unable to efficiently process the massive data generated by a large number of edge devices. Therefore, edge-type big data processing which is oriented to massive data computing generated by network edge devices—edge computing comes into being. However, due to the complexity of edge computing, data security and privacy issues become more prominent. Aiming at the security authentication of edge equipment under the Internet of everything, this paper designs an identity authentication framework under the Internet of everything based on edge computing. In the framework, multi-factor identity authentication is applied to solve the weakness of edge equipment security authentication. Moreover, the software defined network technology (SDN) is adopted to realize the global management of the deployment and application of a large number of edge equipment, which can effectively realize the effective security protection of the Internet of everything. In the end, the formalized verification of the identity authentication process of the designed framework is carried out. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={Combination of Cloud Computing and Trusted Computing is an important method to build a trusted cloud environment, and the most critical problem is the virtualization of TPM (Trusted Platform Module, TPM). But in view of the current research, TPM virtualization still not only does not meet the whole TCG specification, but also has a lot of security issues, and it is becoming the bottleneck of building a trusted cloud environment by combination of Cloud Computing and Trusted Computing. This paper introduces the basic concepts, types and basic requirements of TPM virtualization. The classification model of TPM virtualization is put forward by the I/O device virtualization technology. The main research work of the key technologies of TPM virtualization, such as architecture, key management, certification trust extension, migration and so on, are described in detail, moreover taking time as the clue, we can display a panoramic view of the evolution of related key technologies. Combined with the existing research results, the research direction and challenges of TPM virtualization under TCG architecture are discussed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={The knowledge graph is a promising method for knowledge management in the big data era. Pediatrics, as an essential branch of clinical medicine, has accumulated a large amount of medical data. This paper applies the knowledge graph technique in pediatric studies and proposes a method for Chinese pediatric medical knowledge graph (PMKG) construction. The proposed method has a conceptual layer and a data layer. At the conceptual layer we analyze the semantic characteristics of multi-source pediatrics data, formulate the annotation scheme of entity and entity relationship, and extend the traditional triplet form of knowledge graph to a sextuplet form. At the data layer, guided by the annotation scheme, information is extracted from data sources using entity recognition and relationship extraction. Manual annotation, knowledge fusion and other technologies are used to construct a pediatric knowledge graph. The PMKG contains 22,023 entities and 34,434 sextuplets. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={The article discusses the possibilities of using Master Data Management (MDM) technology to solve the problem of developing a corporate (institutional) state system segment to detect, prevent and eliminate the cyber - attack consequences (hereinafter - SOPKA). Typical objectives of semantic cyber security MDM is identified in article. The semantic cyber security MDM means a data management system that operates rules of the object behavior and interaction in cyberspace to solve the SOPKA problems in order to prevent the protected critical infrastructure transition to catastrophic states. Cyber security ontology (meta-ontology) as the knowledge presentation way about qualitative characteristics and quantitative patterns of information confrontation is proposed. Shown, that by combining cyber security data from various external and internal information sources and corresponding rules to detect, prevent, and eliminate the cyber-attacks consequences into a single semantic domain model, it is possible to build the required intellectual (and, in the future, cognitive) information space, then to develop the appropriate artificial cognitive agents and the corresponding intelligent “semantic cyber security MDM” software and hardware complex to support SOPKA operations as a whole. The basic development principles of the “semantic cyber security MDM” software and hardware complex are formulated. The possible architecture of the “Warning-2016” software and hardware complex that is intended for early cyber-attack warning on corporate and institutional information resources of the Russian Federation is shown. It is based on SAP HANA, and the required semantic MDM is implemented on the basis of SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management (SAP NW MDM). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Security is one of the most challenging issues facing the Internet of Things. One of the most usual architecture for IoT ecosystems has three layers (Acquisition, Networks and Applications), and provides the security to the different elements of the IoT ecosystems through specific technology or techniques, available in the different layers. However, the deployment of security technology at each layer complicates the management and maintainability of the security credentials increasing the risk of information leak, greater manual intervention and complicates the maintainability of consistency of the sensitive data. In this paper we propose a new architecture model, where a fourth security layer has been added, containing all the security technology traditionally delegated to the other layers, removing them from other layers. This new model is supported by the widespread use of Digital Objects, covering all aspects including physical components, processes and sensed data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The importance of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms and services has frequently been emphasized. This study focused on radio frequency identifier (RFID) linen tags and investigated Japanese linen supply markets regarding the application of RFID technology, expected IoT services, and approaches to platform ecosystem evolution. A total of 1,176 questionnaires were sent to Japanese linen supply firms and 136 responses were received. The results identified a promising business area in which the RFID platform provider cultivates an IoT service platform ecosystem in the Japanese linen industry. This has several implications for transportation management and services for hotels, restaurants, medical, and nursing, and firms in these sectors tend to show a high willingness-to-pay and willingness regarding the introduction of RFID. Additionally, since this area is located in the center of the linen firms’ network, the platform provider can extend the ecosystem in several ways. Based on these results and a consideration of eco-systemization based on previous literature, the authors suggest a method for the realization of IoT service platform ecosystems with RFID linen tag technology. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={User Authentication is essential in electric information management system where the operations should be controlled according to standard specifications. Traditionally the authentication is implemented by rule/rights definitions in the static database, which is difficult to manage and audit when there are a number of users and resources. Therefore, blockchain technology is introduced to facilitate user authentication considering its decentralized and security features. However, the performance of blockchain based authentication is relatively low compared with the centralized database. In this paper, we propose a high-performance user authentication framework for electric information management system based on multiple level structure and parallel computing. The proposed framework is implemented in a Provincial electric company of China State Grid. According to the experimental results, the proposed framework not only implements the blockchain based user authentication by also improves the system performance by 60% compared with the non-optimized system. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={Asset management is one of the important application areas of new Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such as data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). However, in many cases, the application area of IoT is limited to only a small part of the maintenance operation, so only a small maintenance improvement is obtained for maintenance companies, and at the same time, IoT sales also remain small for IT companies. Maintenance IoT solutions sometimes fail to be introduced into actual operations even though the technology trial is successfully completed. To avoid such situations, the customer cocreation method has been introduced into maintenance IoT projects. However, the knowledge and interest gaps between maintenance and IoT companies prevent the discussion. In this research, we introduce our maintenance service menu, which contains various ideas for maintenance improvements and connects maintenance improvements and IoT solution sets. We also introduce a new customer cocreation method based on the service menu. The service menu and new cocreation method are expected to realize practical and effective maintenance IoT project organization and cross-selling of solutions to expand both maintenance improvement effects and IoT sales. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={Digitization in logistics bears enormous potential for increased efficiency. Especially, the logistics of the last mile that causes between 13% and 75% of the overall logistics cost of parcel shipment could strongly benefit from digitization and an increased transparency. This transparency and a smart process control can be achieved with the help of a smart service platform. Such a platform connects with sensor, ID, and authentication technology in order to operate approaches, such as crowd logistics and sharing concepts with the goal of enabling an efficient, sustainable and user friendly last mile process. The contribution of this paper is a first conceptualization of the smart service platform for last mile logistics with special regards of the underlying business process management. A design science research approach is applied. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={Literature on customer experience management suggests that a seamless integration of touchpoints would create stronger customer experiences, but how to effectively do so is a key point of debate. This paper presents findings from an empirical study that surveyed Japanese car buyers in terms of their perception of touchpoints throughout their customer journey. The study is based on a framework drawing from “fluency” as a way to understand technology integration, in which the authors propose an integrated and holistic approach to measuring challenges that impede the “fluency” of experiences and result in what they call “friction.” Findings of this study show that while the majority of customers report that their car purchase experience was smooth and hassle free, a significant share also report points of resistance that made the customer journey more difficult or fragmented. Furthermore, a correspondence analysis of open-ended questions asking for suggestions to make the experience easier and hassle free demonstrated that each purchase stage is characterized by distinct word combinations, with a significantly high rate of requests to increase online touchpoints and enhancing test drives in the early pre-purchase stage, to facilitate negotiation in the purchase stage, and to increase after-sales contact and support activities in the post-purchase stage. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={With the rise of artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs have been widely considered as a cornerstone of AI. In recent years, an increasing number of large-scale knowledge graphs have been constructed and published, by both academic and industrial communities, such as DBpedia, YAGO, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph, Microsoft Satori, Facebook Entity Graph, and others. In fact, a knowledge graph is essentially a large network of entities, their properties, semantic relationships between entities, and ontologies the entities conform to. Such kind of graph-based knowledge data has been posing a great challenge to the traditional data management theories and technologies. In this paper, we introduce the state-of-the-art research on knowledge graph data management, which includes knowledge graph data models, query languages, storage schemes, query processing, and reasoning.

abstract={The traceability system is significant to consumers because it can protect the health of consumers and the stability of society. With the development of blockchain technology, it is concerned by researchers of the traceability system because of its immutability and consensus mechanism. For guaranteeing the confidentiality of core data, it is necessary to control data permissions in the supply chain. However, the existing blockchain authority management frameworks mostly concentrate on the medical field and the Internet of Things (IoT). They have to take a long time to reach consensus and store lots of data in the chain. The most important is that the number of transactions submitted per second has always been a bottleneck. In this paper, we proposed an authority management framework used to control the authority of different roles in the traceability system. It pays attention to store small amounts of data on the chain, optimize the consensus rate, and increase the number of transactions per second (TPS). We design a simple experiment to contrast the performance of our framework and the MedRec [1] framework, and the results show that our framework’s consensus rate and TPS are better than the MedRec [1]. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing demand for digital copyright transactions in the big data era causes the emergence of piracy and infringement incidents. The traditional centralized digital copyright protection system based on centralized authority management of authoritative organizations has high registration cost. Blockchain, as a decentralized protocol, has the characteristics of decentralization, anonymity, auditability, security and persistency, which provide a solution to the current problems in the field of digital copyright. Combining with blockchain technology, this paper proposes a digital copyright registration and transaction system with double chain architecture. The blockchain based on digital copyright registration and management chain (RMC) and digital copyright transaction and subscription chain (TSC) can prevent information disclosure and improve the privacy protection by segregating account information and transaction information. Meanwhile, transforming the previous one-chain architecture into multiple chains in parallel on the RMC and TSC can reduce the redundant amount of computation, the consensus efficiency and improve the throughput rate. Experimental analysis shows that the system has the advantages of short registration time, high throughput and good scalability. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Network Slicing technologies present promising solutions to enhance vehicular networks. Using these technologies, a dedicated slice will be deployed whenever a new service is requested. However, in this context, mobility management should be considered in order to support seamless roaming among different network slices. The roaming of users requires inter-slices interactions. In this paper, we propose a network slicing architecture for vehicular network application. We are interested especially in the management process. The challenge is to respect the required Quality of Service (QoS) for users during their movement from one slice to another. For this purpose, we propose an algorithm for the control of users’ mobility between different network slices. Mininet emulator and Ryu controller were considered to validate our proposed algorithm. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Since business process modeling is considered as the foundation of Business Process Management, it is required to design understandable and modifiable process models used to analyze and improve depicted business processes. Therefore, this article proposes a method for business process model analysis and improvement. The lifecycle of Business Process Management from business process modeling to applying the Business Intelligence and process mining techniques is considered. Existing approaches to business process model analysis are reviewed. Proposed method is based on best practices in business process modeling, process model metrics, and corresponding thresholds. The usage of business process model metrics and thresholds to formalize process modeling guidelines is outlined, as well as the procedure of business process model analysis and improvement is shown. The application of Business Intelligence techniques to support the proposed method is demonstrated, as well as the obtained results are shown and discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The implicit difficulties (resources and intermittent generation) of renewable energies prevent their insertion with greater security and reliability in electricity networks. However, as the priority of favoring environmental issues and represent one of the main axes of the electricity sector, it is essential to make efforts that characterize the behavior of the effective production of photovoltaic systems in real applications. In this way, the objective of this article is to propose a methodology where the monthly profile of future facilities is estimated. To this end, the received solar radiation (based on the Gamma probability distribution) is modeled along with the generation of seven photovoltaic arrays of different technology, connected to the microgrid of the Center for the Development of Renewable Energies (CEDER), belonging to the Center of Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT), located in Soria, Spain. The measurement of the solar resource was made with a Baseline Surface Radiation Network, and the injection of photovoltaic power to the microgrid was acquired with the help of smart meters. The verification of the procedure was carried out with simulations in Matlab and the statistical analyzes were confirmed with the JMP software. The results may be helpful in sizing a backup model and will collaborate in the proper management of the case study energy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a widespread technology where everyday objects are being transferred toward intelligent devices. These smart devices incorporate sensing, computing, and networking abilities into them. A smartphone, a smartwatch can be utilized for various tasks other than calling and timekeeping. Even home appliances also incorporate a midrange computer. Therefore, the most advanced applications and services have considerably risen. Despite numerous gains, security threats increased in terms of recorded catastrophic events as well as attack severity. There are multiple threads in 6LoWPAN and related routing protocol. In our research paper, we perform and assess an energy-efficient, lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS) for the 6LoWPAN network. The primary goal of this paper to target routing attacks (i.e., selective-forwarding, sinkhole, etc.). Our intended energy-efficient lightweight defense solution which identifies sinkhole attack in the IoT ecosystem. The defense method is executed with the help of Cooja network simulator on the Contiki OS. The experimental outcomes show that the solution is lightweight and can identify the sinkhole attack with a noteworthy performance, and provides 95.86% TPR and 94.31% TNR rate. It also shows minimum memory (RAM/ROM) utilization and energy consumption, which is comparable. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={New technologies and emerging challenges are drastically changing how the energy needs of our society have to be met. By consequence, energy models have to adapt by taking into account such new aspects while aiding in decision making processes of the design of energy systems. In this work the problem of the design and operation of a multi-energy system is tackled by means of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Given the large size of the problem to be solved, a matheuristic approach based on constraint relaxations and variable fixing is proposed in order to not restrict the applicability to small cases. Two variable fixing policies are presented and performance analysis comparison on them has been done. Tests have been performed on small and realistic instances and results show the correctness of the approach and the quality of the heuristic proposed in term of solution quality and computational time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={This study investigated how an interactive e-resource could be used to increase students’ performance for a specific Information Systems assignment given. As academics we are struggling to find sources that really talk to ‘Generation Z’ in the way they prefer to learn. We wanted to determine if we can create such a resource to increase students’ performance. This study investigates the usefulness of a self-created e-textbook for Systems Analysis and Design through the task-technology fit theory lens. A quantitative data analysis was conducted on a group of undergraduate Information Systems students. A significant association between the characteristics of the tasks and the technology used to perform the specific task was found. A significant association between the students’ understanding of the work and improving their knowledge as well as their contributions to a team was also found. Generation Z relies heavily on peers for assistance even though literature says that their social skills are under-developed. As academics we need to understand the Generation Z, and how they prefer to study, and then create content and tools for them so that they can broaden their knowledge and become life-long learners. Higher education institutions should become more student-centered and less lecturer-centered. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},
