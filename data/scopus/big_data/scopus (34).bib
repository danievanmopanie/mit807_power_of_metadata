abstract={The rapid, relentless, globalization of manufacturing and services, and the substantial productivity gains of the past several years, has created the need for well-rounded graduating engineers, understanding the business side of engineering just as well as the technical side. They also have to understand the rigors of brutal international competition, and be prepared to withstand it successfully, and even thrive in these conditions. In order to prepare our students for increased globalization, Cooper Union has undertaken the task of upgrading our course offerings, and improving our students' business, communications, leadership, and teamwork skills throughout the curriculum. We also have created a course in which globalization is discussed at length, and applied in an Internet based jointventure project simulation, in the GLOBETECH project. The GLOBETECH project has been successful for the past nine years, and represents one of our major achievements in preparing our graduating engineers for the challenges of the twenty-first century. This article presents our recent experiences with the GLOBETECH project, and aims to encourage engineering schools from all over to participate in this, or similar projects.},

abstract={In today's construction industry, with the introduction of new materials, free-form shapes of buildings, special problems with historical preservation, LEED Certification of buildings and even buildings with very large components that move, there are many new challenges for architectural engineers. This paper highlights some of the work done at Milwaukee School of Engineering by undergraduate students in summer of 2002 and 2003 that links architectural engineering with our Rapid Prototyping Center. This work started as research under the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Solid Freeform Fabrication program at MSOE. This is a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation. In the past projects have ranged from replication of historical decorative plaster details, writing code to translate drawing files into a form that can be read by the rapid prototyping machines, to modeling a building designed for Milwaukee School of Engineering by Santiago Calatrava. More recent projects have explored the use of Visual Basic to translate drawings into a form that can be utilized by rapid prototyping (RP), a method of using RP and photo stress analysis in the design of point supported glass, and two projects that utilize GIS data and RP to study the Milwaukee River Watershed. An encouraging side benefit of this undergraduate research has been a high percentage of our REU students going on to graduate school.},

abstract={The Ekranoplan project offers technology educators an additional inexpensive and creative design project that is appropriate for students from middle school through university. The project excites students about technology while motivating them to learn math and science using a team-oriented environment. The project utilizes learning objectives that may be tied to standardized assessments. Masters of Education candidates at Western Washington University developed the Ekranoplan vehicle project during a Technology Education course. An Ekranoplan or Wing-In-Ground Effect vehicle flies very close to a water surface. The vehicle uses design elements of both airplanes and marine craft. Ground-effect flight enables a vehicle to carry either a larger payload or operate with greater fuel efficiency than a conventional airplane. The candidates tested several vehicle configurations, power sources and construction techniques. Vehicle construction guidelines and curriculum outlines were developed to disseminate to other technology educators. The project has been used to teach the engineering design process to freshman students in Western Washington University's Engineering Technology Design Graphics course.},

abstract={Since 1980's, Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) has dramatically changed the way of manufacturing in all industries as well as the way manufacturing courses are taught. Among many worldwide CIM programs offered at various universities, some are more application oriented, some focus more on the business aspects, and some put more emphasis on the information technology behind the CIM concept. Over the last decade, CIM had evolved into a newer concept, namely Computer Integrated Enterprise (CIE), due to the advancements in the area of information technology and its applications in e-business. Nevertheless, there is still a gap between the shop floor and the upper level functions, such as enterprise resource planning. This paper focuses on the automated manufacturing systems and production aspects of CIE under the umbrella term of Integrated Manufacturing with emphasis on integration and reconfigurability of laboratory equipment to provide the most effective environment for hands-on applications. The paper introduces the basic features and capabilities of a laboratory, Integrated Systems Facility (ISF) (http://www.umr.edu/~isf/), which was established with the goal of improving manufacturing system related courses at the Engineering Management Department at the University of Missouri - Rolla (UMR). It highlights several teaching and research aspects of this initiative. Courses that have been determined by considering various learning styles in order to encourage life-long learning within the scope of integrated manufacturing concept and their laboratory requirements are discussed. A sample project is described in order to highlight the overall approach.},

abstract={Systematic improvement is a buzz word in the manufacturing world. Companies want to hear or know about how they can do one or all of the following three things: a) Produce more by keeping input at the same level, b) produce at the same level with a reduced input, or c) do both; that is, produce more with less input. The question often faced is whether this is possible. The answer to this question depends on the extent to which the company is willing to go to achieve its goal. In any of (a) through (c), many alternatives can be explored. These include productivity improvement through time study, ergonomics, and investment in new technology, worker's motivation, and attitude of the management towards productivity. All of these alternatives are not the same but they can be implemented individually or collectively. This paper discusses how a student used the combination of time study and redesign to help a mid-size company improve its manufacturing processes. This effort ultimately resulted in improved quality and increased productivity of workers in a section of the company. It also reduced the amount of personal, delay and fatigue allowances of the workers.},

abstract={There have been calls within engineering practice and engineering education to develop within engineers a capacity to recognise and accommodate diverse and even competing perspectives within decision-making processes. To satisfy these needs an instructional technique called Structured Academic Controversy was modified for multi-party controversies and for use with internet mediated communication. The activity specifically seeks to promote multiple perspective-taking on a controversial science and technology public issue and to develop conflict management skills, critical thinking and collaborative skills. The technique has been used to explore controversy surrounding genetically modified foods, the provision of telecommunication infrastructure to meet regional needs, the role of e-Libraries and the damming of international rivers. Feedback from student surveys show that there was a high level of student agreement that the activity developed their awareness of the political, social, environmental and scientific dimensions of the issue discussed. There were also high levels of student satisfaction with the activity. However due to the high number of student postings and the threaded nature of the discussion forum some students found it difficult to interact with all the points raised and to sustain dialogue within a thread. These problems with online dialogue have also been found in other studies. The instructional technique described has been effective in allowing students to develop knowledge of contemporary issues and appreciate the impacts of engineering solutions.},

abstract={The Department of Engineering at Western Kentucky University (WKU) has been given the rare opportunity to develop an entirely new engineering program. Western's challenge is to create a unique undergraduate curriculum focused on the needs of current and future industrial partners. In the 1990's, a move towards a project-based learning model was developed and is generally supported in the American engineering education undergraduate community. A primary focus of Western Kentucky University's engineering programs is to provide a project-based experience at all levels of the curriculum. Currently, the field of Digital technology is progressing rapidly. The electrical engineering curriculum at WKU requires all students to take a minimum of three courses in this field: Digital Logic, Introduction to Industrial Automation, and Microprocessors. Students take Digital Logic in the first year. In the digital logic course students use the 7400 series TTL chips and Xilinx CPLD, Students use an Allen Bradley programmable logic controller and an Atmel AYR STK 500 Microcomputer in Introduction to Industrial Automation. Students in the microprocessors course use the Motorola HC12. Another course, EE design I, also has a strong digital component. The results of the initial offerings, including student feedback and course assessment are included. Examples of projects tackled by the students, lessons learned by the faculty, and lists of necessary equipment are provided.},

abstract={Old Dominion University (ODU) has developed two fundamental courses for freshmen engineering students. The first course introduces the fundamentals of the practice of engineering including innovation, creativity, design and manufacturing, commercialization, teaming skills, environmental impact, and ethics. The second course is an exploration of engineering and engineering technology disciplines with an emphasis on projects. The purpose of these courses is to engage the students in the application of engineering early in their course of study with the hope that their interest will be reinforced and the likelihood of their being retained as students will increase. The courses are divided into three five-week modules that are distributed among departments within the college. The Engineering Technology department is responsible for two of the five-week modules in the second, projects-based course. One module is comprised of the civil, mechanical and electrical engineering technology curricula and the other module is comprised of strictly civil engineering technology. This paper describes the freshmen engineering courses and outlines the projects that have been developed for Civil Engineering Technology at Old Dominion University.

abstract={The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (Tech) has offered an MS degree in Technology Management (TM) since 1990. With its early involvement in distance education, the TM faculty has experienced a wide array of technologies and issues surrounding distance education. The program is now one of the largest graduate programs on campus and is made up of both on-site and distance learners. Most recently, SDSM&T has entered into a cooperative agreement with the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST) to offer the program in Mongolia. In this paper, we discuss some of the relevant technological and logistical issues that had to be addressed in a joint development effort. One interesting aspect of the project is multi-media considerations that differ substantially between distance learning needs in the U. S. and those required for delivery in Mongolia.},

abstract={Aalborg University's thirty years of experience with project-organised and problem-oriented studies has proved by continuous assessment to be an important innovation in higher education. The curriculum in engineering as well as in natural science is project-organised from the day the freshman arrives until graduation. In the design-oriented project work the students deal with some degree of know-how problems which involve a great part of theories and knowledge acquired from lectures. In the problem-oriented project work the students deal with know-why unsolved problems in science and profession. The new master programme in Architecture and Design will be used as a case example with its unique use of problem-based learning methods. The programme started in 1997 and admits 110 students every year, it consists of a 2-semester basic programme, 3- semester common ground study-programme and a 5-semester specialisation programme. In the specialisation the students choose one of the following four specialisations: Architecture, Urban design, Digital design or Industrial design. The benefit of the problem-based learning method is given by some considerations about project work carried out within Industrial design and from continuous evaluation results.},

This environment focuses on engineering problems solving, increased information technology content, and the higher order cognitive skills that are needed to be a successful engineering problem solver. We describe the status of this project, which has been implemented in two courses: an engineering economy course and a manufacturing systems engineering course. One of the objectives of this new environment is integration of the curriculum, and we discuss how links were created between these two courses to highlight connections between the course contents, and how this results in rethinking and improvements of the existing curriculum. We also show how the environment encourages development of engineering problem solving skills, as well as the basic cognitive skills needed. Finally, we discuss our assessment of the new learning environment, how it has been received by students, and how it is improving learning for industrial engineering students.},

In this environment a knowledge organization can be created as a hierarchical learning network to link diverse inter- and trans-disciplinary teams from a consortium of universities, industry, government agencies and the providers of learning technologies. It is an approach that builds on computer-based training, intelligent tutoring systems, interactive learning, collaborative-distributed learning, and learning networks. The present design optimization module has been developed and described herein, as a demonstrator of a learning module in this environment. This module allows for the learners of design optimization to get the course material at their own convenience and time either via the internet or packaged files. Consequently, it is expected that the learner's ability to understand design optimization and review its pertinent details will be enhanced significantly.},

abstract={In the early 1990s, Ohio State found that all incoming engineering students were being retained to graduation with a degree in engineering at a rate of about 38 percent. Honors students were being retained at approximately a 50 to 60 percent rate. In 1992, Ohio State joined with nine other engineering colleges to form the Gateway Engineering Education Coalition where one of the goals was to improve retention. Other goals were to develop modern curricula, to introduce technology into the classroom, to develop faculty to be better teachers, and to develop students to be better and life-long learners. The model for developing Ohio State's lower division programs was Drexel University's E4 program. This paper describes the development of the Fundamentals of Engineering for Honors Program at Ohio State, the resulting increase in retention, the building of community, the effect on recruiting good students, and the support of industry.},

abstract={Despite today's growth in the age of knowledge, information and technology, the enrollment and conferring of undergraduate degrees in engineering and engineering technology continues to fall short of the nation's demands. In the state of New Jersey, from 1998-2002, only ∼5.3% of the degrees awarded were in engineering and engineering technology (NJ Commission on Higher Education, 2003). In 2002, New Jersey Institute of Technology became the sixth university affiliate of a national pre-engineering program called Project Lead The Way® (PLTW), as one strategy to increase the pool of New Jersey secondary school students interested and prepared to enroll, and graduate from post-secondary, undergraduate engineering-related programs. PLTW trains secondary school teachers to implement one middle school and six high school yearlong courses. This paper presents a state's perspective on the impact of the skills development and implementation of PLTW on secondary school educators, students and guidance counselors throughout New Jersey over the past four and a half years. Currently, 78 teachers in New Jersey have been trained to implement this program in 7 middle schools and 20 high schools represented by 21 public school districts. The institutionalization of this pre-engineering program across a profile of different high school environments is examined. We explore the similarities and differences of implementation within a "magnet" high school and a comprehensive school. Perspectives of both teachers and students are included.},

However, the 'elephant on the table' that no one wants to talk about is the decisions and systems change that must accompany implementation, and the deep cultural change that must occur in the organization to sustain outcomes assessment. This paper will take a case study approach to discuss systems and business model changes necessary for outcomes assessment implementation. Using real examples the authors will examine the parallel business decisions that must occur during the academic analysis process, discuss implementation problems, and offer action-based approaches to resource, data, and organizational change issues.},

abstract={The fast-moving world of information technology is greatly changing the practice of civil engineering. Thus, it is generating changing needs and opportunities in education. These needed changes are both in program content and in delivery. The authors have conducted a NSF Department-Level Reform Planning Grant on the topic of "Information Technology in the Integrated Civil Engineering Curriculum", and this paper reflects findings from this effort. The primary emphasis of this paper is on the utilization of Information Technology within the civil engineering profession and in the large-scale products and systems the civil engineering profession provides, operates and maintains. Instructional technology, both general and IT is noted more as a part of implementing changes within the educational environment. Information technology as utilized in CE can be placed into four general categories. (1) personal IT/computing tools - which all graduates and civil engineers need at a fairly high level of proficiency, (2) civil engineering systems tools such networks, data structures, highly interactive design, supervisory control and data acquisition systems, decision support systems and other IT tools applied to intelligent transportation systems, NDE, environmental monitoring and control, smart buildings, etc., (3) IT-system components - sensors, actuators, communication links, etc., used in remote systems, and (4) IT tools used in instruction, presentation, sales, and general communications. The future graduate cannot be an expert in all of these areas. The paper explores which IT topics need to be addressed at what level of proficiency (recognition, understanding, or ability) and how this might be achieved in revised courses or academic programs.},

Freshmen seldom question the transferability of learned habits and assume they will apply equally well to the university environment. Consequently, the "Ready, Fire, Aim" philosophy best describes the student's mentality as they embark on the academic rigors of college life. This paper describes an "Academic Resolution Exercise" instituted in the Freshman Engineering Technology seminar. It is specifically designed to teach freshmen how to establish, monitor and accomplish academic goals essential for them to successfully transition to the significant academic demands of a higher education institution. Ultimately, the results of this exercise enhance the probability of students succeeding academically in their critical first year. Their success, in turn, assists the university's student retention rate.},

abstract={Competitions can create an effective learning environment by engaging students in active and cooperative learning. And while competition and cooperation are usually considered by educational researchers to be opposites, they can be used in conjunction to support learning. This study discusses the results of teaching upper-division and graduate-level technology courses that include a competitive project as a major part of the class. In this setting, students design and construct electronics projects, with ample opportunity for creative expression. The project goal is clearly defined, but the solution is not strongly constrained, and students work in teams to find it. In turn, the cooperation among team members and the competition between teams, and often, the cooperation between teams as well, all serve to motivate the students and enhance various aspects of learning. This approach was used with two different groups of technology students at two universities. Student response was evaluated using qualitative evaluation techniques and analyzed for trends and student impact. We also report on how to design a competition-based course to meet educational needs.},

abstract={Projects are defined as temporary and unique by the Project Management Institute Body of Knowledge (PMI BoK). Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) assumes incremental improvements over time. If a project is temporary and unique, how can we incrementally apply CPI over time? How do we develop lessons learned from a temporary project and how and when do we apply them? Projects are further defined by the PMI BoK to include process groups and individual processes. The concepts of Total Quality Management (TQM) and CPI are related to management processes as evidenced by the fact that TQM in some companies is called Process Management. A conceptual framework is proposed that applies CPI to individual Project Management (PM) processes. This model shows that repeatable project management processes can be continuously improved. The author applied these concepts to the projects in a large consumer based Information Technology (IT) group. The result was a significant increase in projects meeting their completion time, budget and performance objectives.},

abstract={For the past few years the Department of Engineering Technology have offered a senior design capstone course that helps Electronic Engineering Technology students develop interdisciplinary skills and knowledge to work on designs and products requiring the integration of mechanical, electrical, and microprocessor-control systems. Mechatronics is a term frequently used for this integration. The course features an autonomous mobile robot that the students must design, fabricate, test, and document. The course incorporates recent TAC/ABET (Technology Accreditation Commission of Accrediting Board of Engineering and Technology) guidelines concerning open-ended design problems. In this course and under these guidelines the students develop creativity, refine and use accepted design methods, formulate problem statements and specifications, consider alternative solutions and determine feasibility issues, and create detailed system descriptions. Students work individually or in teams of two or three on their projects. Lecturing is kept to a minimum and the class takes on a more or less studio-learning atmosphere, with the instructor acting as an advisor and making rounds to each project to check on progress in meeting developmental milestones and to offer guidance. Students are required to meet five check-point deadlines and the finished robot is to exhibit three behavioral objectives. This robotics project has become very popular with the students and has even attracted some students who are Computer Information Science majors to select the course as a technical elective. This senior design course featuring autonomous mobile robots, now in its fifth year, continues to be rated highly by students as an opportunity in which they experienced both teamwork and personal achievement in the hands-on application of the knowledge gained during the course of their bachelor's degree program.},

abstract={Many engineering technology departments have four general areas that are used for evaluation of tenure and promotion. These areas include teaching, research and scholarly activities, service, and other professional activities. Although teaching is the primary mission in most engineering technology programs, external funding as part of the research area is playing a larger role in tenure decisions at many universities. Many faculty members in engineering technology programs come from an industrial background and do not have a specific research area of interest and contacts within the research community. These faculty members must look at other avenues to develop the external funding necessary for tenure. Departments and faculty must think in an entrepreneurial way to consider and value all types of external funding options. One possibility that produces a wide range of ancillary benefits is continuing education programs. This paper describes a model that was developed for continuing education programs in an engineering technology department. It details the problems associated with the implementation of the model for the first series of courses and outlines future plans to implement additional course series.},

abstract={UMES-AIR (Undergraduate Multidisciplinary Earth Science-Airborne Imaging Research) project was partially funded by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the fall of 1999. The project has provided a platform for involving a group of more than twenty undergraduate students in mathematics science engineering and technology (MSET) curricula at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) in an out of classroom active learning and exploratory research experience in the field of remote sensing and its applications. UMES, an 1890 Land Grant historically black university, has a large minority population and all efforts are made to involve minority students to participate in the project activities. The scientific objective of the project includes aerial imaging in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, land survey study of shoreline erosion, research in agricultural land use patterns, environmental studies and atmospheric data analysis. The first phase (Phase-I) of the project has been successfully completed in August 2001 when the goal of collecting remote images from a tethered blimp from a height of 2500ft. was achieved by the UMES student team working in close collaboration with NASA GSFC Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), technicians, engineers, and administrative personnel. As the first group of students who led the Phase-I efforts progressed through college and graduated or moved to junior/senior levels with more demanding academic loads, the need for vertical integration of project participants became clear. Subsequent to the Phase-I efforts that were adequately funded students in the MSET major at UMES have been encouraged to take part in the project by the participating faculty members out of their own interest without any financial incentives. Although the numbers of student participation have gone down, significant achievements have been made with regard to achieving the Phase-II goals during the years 2002 and 2003.},

abstract={This paper reports on a work in progress in developing an interactive Control Systems learning object. The objective of the work is to enhance active learning and visualization, and to provide students with improved formative feedback and review of the learned concepts despite challenges of increased class sizes. The module is developed within a framework of the Co-operative Learning Object Exchange (CLOE), a collaborative project of several universities in Ontario, establishing an infrastructure for joint development of multimedia-rich, interactive learning resources. Since development of such resources is very time-consuming, one of the emerging trends in instructional technology is to focus on modular learning objects that can be shared among many users. Surveys of faculty confirm high interest in utilization of such objects. The module being developed by the authors consists of a series of interactive online tutorials. It is designed using Flash and streaming video technology and provides graphics, video, and animation to support the basic concepts. At any time the learner has access to several review quizzes, providing feedback on comprehension of the content. In-class testing of the beta version of the module is planned for Winter 2004, to be followed by a more systematic evaluation of the module's usability and observations of the interactions with the module by volunteers with different learning styles.},

abstract={This paper is a review of a series of evaluation studies that were utilized to inform and evaluate a large scale instructional software development project at-the university of Missouri - Rolla entitled "Taking the Next Step in Engineering Education: Integrating Educational Software and Active Learning." This project was funded by the U.S. Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education (FIPSE), and was carried out over the last four years. The assessment was carried out under the auspices of UMR's Laboratory for Information Technology Evaluation (LITE), and guided by the LITE model for evaluation of learning technologies. The fundamental premise of the model is that evaluation should consist of the triangulation of multiple research methodologies and measurement tools. Five representative evaluation studies, consisting of eight experiments, are presented here. The studies range from initial research consisting of basic experimentation and usability testing; to applied research conducted within the class room; to a large multi-nation cross-cultural applied-dissemination survey conducted during the last semester of the project. The results indicate that the instructional multimedia developed in this project can have a substantial positive impact in enhancing fundamental engineering classes. Further, the research also indicates that the LITE model can be an effective tool for guiding a comprehensive evaluation program.},

abstract={The primary purpose of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point is to produce leaders for the U.S. Army. Thus, the curriculum is tailored with this goal in mind. One of the selling points of the computer science program is its emphasis on problem solving. The premise is that the problem solving skills that are instilled through computer science can be extrapolated to problem solving in general and easily applied to problem solving in the U. S. Army. All cadets are required to take two or more courses in Information Technology and/or Computer Science. At a minimum, a cadet can take two classes in Information Technology which teach basic problem solving as part of their curriculum. Additionally, some students select a three course engineering sequence in computer science which further develops their problem solving skills. Finally, those cadets who major in computer science are exposed to advanced methodologies such as an object-oriented approach to problem solving. This paper examines the approach to teaching problem solving within the introductory core information technology course (IT105) and the first course of the Computer Science major (CS301). First, this paper will address the introductory techniques taught to all cadets within the first course. Next, it will discuss how these techniques are enhanced and extended in the second. Finally, it will describe how the tools and techniques taught within these two courses extrapolate to problem solving in general.},

abstract={An undergraduate course in dynamic systems involves basic material in previous undergraduate courses that are critical building blocks for course execution. Differential Equations, Mathematical Methods for Engineers, Dynamics, etc. are all basic underlying material that is critical to the material covered in an undergraduate course. Material taught in those prerequisite courses is often considered irrelevant to the student since there is no practical application to firmly instill these basic STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) concepts. A traditional Dynamic Systems course, with traditional class lecture/homework/test scenario is destined to the same fate as these earlier courses, if taught in the same manner. A new variation of this Dynamic Systems course has been implemented, which has individual projects which address various analytical approaches using closed-form analytical solutions with MATLAB and SIMULINK computer software to completely address 1st and 2nd order systems. In addition, a laboratory based component is added to collect measured data for these systems to be used to further develop the analytical representation of these systems. Students work in groups and collect data to develop these models and prepare detailed reports summarizing their efforts. Each project is anonymously peer reviewed by another team to provide a detailed evaluation of the report and data evaluation. As a result of this peer review, the students further appreciate the need to analyze and report findings in an accurate manner. The project is described along with laboratory experiments performed. Student comments regarding the project are presented. Assessments at the end of the first deployment of the project clearly indicate that the students enjoyed the hands-on based project and clearly felt that they understood the material in much greater depth as a result of the project.},

abstract={With the support of a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, faculty at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) are initiating a new program in Humanitarian Engineering (http://humanitarian.mines.edu/). Our specific goals are to: create a culture of acceptance for humanitarian service endeavors among engineering students and faculty; increase the number of engineering graduates that enter occupations and /or internships in service related industries and organizations; and, increase the recruitment and retention of women and minority students. The project includes the development of a minor degree program in Humanitarian Engineering (HE). The minor degree involves extensive collaboration and participation of faculty from the Division of Liberal Arts and International Studies (LAIS) at CSM. First envisioned as a minor degree available only to students with civil, electrical, environmental and mechanical engineering, the concept has evoked widespread interest among students and faculty at CSM, resulting in the planning of a second minor degree in Humanitarian Studies and Technology, which would serve students in applied science and economics. In this paper, we present some of the problems and issues associated with this multidisciplinary endeavor, involving engineering, the sciences and the humanities.},

The aim is to have students learn aspects of management that will be relevant from the outset of their professional career while simultaneously having immediate value in helping them to manage a research project and capstone design project in their senior year. An integral part of this innovation was the development of a web-based project management tool. While the main objectives of the new course design were achieved, a number of important lessons were learned that would guide the further development and continuous improvement of this course. The most critical of these is the need to achieve the optimum balance in the mind of the students between doing the project and critically analyzing the processes used to accomplish the work.},

abstract={In recent years study-abroad experience in collegiate education has become highly valued by both academia and non-academic employers. For a variety of reasons, developing this type of program in engineering education is particularly difficult. This paper presents an innovative study-abroad program in engineering education recently developed at Michigan State University in collaboration with the Volgograd State University of Architectural and Civil Engineering in Volgograd, Russia. This program successfully addresses such academic challenges in engineering education as the inherent vertical structure of scientific curricula, courses with laboratory requirements, ABET accreditation, and accelerated summer course calendars. Engineering disciplines included are civil engineering, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, statistics, and construction management. Also featured in this program is a unique curricular collaboration between the humanities and engineering. The paper also discusses the program's treatment of such logistical issues as student safety, moving large groups of students through a cultural landscape where Russian language proficiency is a necessity, as well as ensuring the financial solvency of the program. Finally, we describe the benefit of multi-institution collaboration and technology exchange in student/faculty research and teaching, both within the Michigan region and with partner Russian academic institutions.},

abstract={This paper describes a new project course in ECET at Purdue University. It is a course taken by students in their 4 th semester of the 2+2 ECET program, and may be considered a capstone course for the AS degree. In it the students must work with a time plan, and must follow a design guide that has them combine both analog and digital course concepts resulting in a finished project. They must use the principles of design for manufacturability (DFM) and design for testability (DFT), and must include the use of both active and passive surface mount technology (SMT) components. In addition to the circuit design, they must also use electronic computer aided design (ECAD) to design and lay out a printed circuit board (PCB), have the PCB made by a commercial PCB fabricator, test it, then populate the PCB and test the resulting printed circuit assembly (PCA). The design also includes a test port, which allows the instructor to add problems to the circuit, which the students must then troubleshoot and identify. The course culminates in both a written report and an oral report.},

abstract={This paper will describe new project management opportunities within the ocean engineering and naval architecture programs at the U.S. Naval Academy. Specifically, engineering management skills and techniques have been adapted to naval engineering settings and included in a new project management area of concentration. One elective course, in particular, introduces students to various inventory, queuing, linear programming and decision theory models, using a conventional management science textbook supplemented by applications from the marine environ. Examples include optimum dredging strategies for navigation channel maintenance, beach fill operations for shore protection and recreational planning, port development and commercial ship routings. Application of such skills crosses many naval disciplines including fleet operations and logistics, engineering duty officer and staff corps responsibilities. The goal of this course is to enhance the engineering and project management skills of Academy midshipmen. Practically speaking, enhancement of such skills will benefit all future naval officers and engineers. Details of the initial offering of this engineering management course as well as other project management opportunities at the U.S. Naval Academy will be reviewed. Suggestions will be offered for further project management developments in ocean engineering and naval architecture programs at this and other institutions.},

abstract={There is no substitute for experience. As educators, we cannot teach our students "experience". However, are able to provide an environment that simulates real world problems and fosters creative thinking and the development of possible solutions. Activity based learning is built upon this premise. Active learning is explained by Bonwell and Eison as, the students "are doing things and thinking about what they are doing". To accomplish this, a group of Engineering Technology students were challenged to apply the lean manufacturing concepts learned in class to a pre-designed production simulation. The simulation, "Wagons R Us*, required the students to assemble wagons using K'NEX plastic components as their raw materials. The simulation begins by having students participate in and observe an extreme case of a traditional production system. According to Dr. Ann Stalheim-Smith, "active learning is not a spectator sport". Therefore, the exercise required each student to actively participate. Students were divided into teams, given the constraints of the system and had one week to implement a more efficient lean manufacturing system. Student teams had to identify the different types of waste associated with the existing simulation and redesign the process to eliminate non-value added activity throughout the process. During the competition, each team would simulate production for thirty minutes. In some cases, the students had to renegotiate their union contract to facilitate improvements made to the manufacturing process. The team that produced the highest number of good wagons with the least amount of labor would be the winner. Points were awarded for the teams that produced the most quality products in the most efficient manner. The students witnessed first hand the importance of lean manufacturing, waste identification and elimination and teamwork in a successful manufacturing system.},

abstract={Many of the Delft University of Technology curricula have a rich history of bringing practice into the classroom. The most common and most obvious way that this is done in Delft is to seek candidates for full professorships almost universally from industry as opposed to having them progress 'up through the ranks' as is most common in US universities. Realizing that most US universities will not change their ways so drastically, the paper describes and analyzes experiences with several other and less far-reaching ways in which industrial guests has been brought into Delft University of Technology curricula: 1. Provide a single lecture period as part of a course. 2. Provide specific expertise for a course exercise. 3. Teach an entire course. 4. Coach a thesis - along with university staff. 5. Participate - as quasi-student - in university-taught classes. Experiences with each of these will be described, but more importantly, lessons learned from the experiences and the methodology for improvement of the utilization of industrial practitioners with students will also be highlighted. All of this work has taken place over the last quarter century with a significant increase in this activity in the most recent decade.},

abstract={It is the author's strong belief that engineering students should seek creative designs from arts as well as other perspectives to understand multidisciplinary design techniques and effectively solve today's complex design problems. In Spring 2003, senior design projects completed at the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis) illustrated the results of a harmonious merger of the artistic and technical talents of our students. This paper presents information on a unique capstone design project that involved collaboration between the arts and engineering, and the impact on the quality of the final design. It is very likely that multidisciplinary design projects will be increasingly developed and implemented in institutions of higher learning across the country as more art and engineering collaborations lead to creative design projects and valuable learning experiences for students.},

abstract={It is widely accepted that increasing the technical literacy among all students is critical as our society becomes increasingly dependent upon science and technology. Therefore, a number of engineering departments at some universities offer courses specifically addressing the needs of the non-engineering students. A general education course, Introduction to Computer-Aided Graphics Tools, has been offered by the Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Management department (MSEM) at California State University, Northridge (CSUN) since Fall 1998. This course was designed to enable computer illiterate students to achieve success in the use of a CAD software package. The students enrolled in this class who form the general population of the CSUN campus usually come from a wide range of academic majors. In this paper, we intend to address the conceptions and expectations of non-engineering students who enrolled in this class. Students were surveyed to determine their opinions regarding science and engineering. The survey was intended to analyze their opinions regarding the importance of technological literacy, their perceived technical literacy after taking the course, their satisfaction with the course, applicability of the course material to their major field of study, their comfort level taking an "engineering" course, whether their expectations of the course content were met, why they took the course in the first place, and would they take another course in the discipline. The input from the non-engineering students forms a useful basis for curriculum development; the results of the study can be used for other engineering educators to develop specific details of instructional programs.},

abstract={The Master of Engineering degree curriculum at Southern University, Baton Rouge (SUBR) includes a required core course titled "Engineering Management". The course material was planned and developed for a period of over a year before the first offering in spring 2002 semester. The engineering management course covers the management principles and applications specifically useful to engineering and technical graduates. The main topics in the course are planning, forecasting, decision making, project management, time management, quality control, optimization, reliability and risk analysis, and scheduling. The engineering management course offers students with ample opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of course materials and related ideas through guided class discussions, open ended projects, assignments, research reports, and tests. The main distinction of this course when compared to a traditional management course is less emphasis on non-technical topics such as accounting and business management. The observations and experiences learnt from the development and teaching of the engineering management course will be described in this paper. The future plan of utilizing SAP software modules 1 in the graduate level engineering management course and in the selected undergraduate level engineering courses will be described. This plan is based on collaboration between the college of engineering and the college of business at Southern University in association with the SAP university alliance program.},

abstract={A unique experience was afforded The University of Toledo Construction Engineering Technology (CET) program through the cooperation of a local construction manager. The construction of a new multi-story student residence hall on campus was to be managed by a firm that had also developed its own web-based project management/workflow software system. The CET program was offered access to this system which allowed for remote observation of the day-to-day construction administration of the two-year project. Student access to the project was tied to the department's required senior project capstone class. A select group of students from that class were then able to connect with a project that they saw everyday on campus. The student team was responsible for an established set of project administration tasks that were to be performed on a periodic basis throughout the semester. Team members were required to take on multiple roles throughout the project, acting as construction managers, sub-contractors, owners representatives and design consultants in order to address the situations that arose randomly based on the actual construction progress. Communication of construction progress was also fostered through required class presentations. Students gained the ability to make real-time decisions regarding the project and gain exposure to valuable lessons in the process of construction management. Additionally, the students gained exposure to the use of a web-based document and workflow process that is becoming the norm in the construction industry for control of complex projects. This paper chronicles and analyzes the development of the first in a proposed succession of similar semester experiences for CET students in the senior capstone class.},

abstract={The tools used in semiconductor processing are superb examples of advanced design for technology. They push the envelope of our process understanding and control in terms of physics, chemistry and mechanical precision and are self-contained microcosms of multi-disciplinary design. This paper describes a project to reverse engineer the design of an Anelva 1015 3-head sputtering tool. Cluster tools are now widely used in the semiconductor industry for metal and dielectric deposition. This is an early version that was donated by Intel to the Microelectronics Teaching Factory at ASU East. A 4-stage self-paced team project activity has been developed. The first stage parameterizes the sputter process using the known operational features of the tool. The second is a set of individual activities to quantify the features of the major sub-systems. The final stages bring the team together again to analyze the trade-offs in the final system and how it has since evolved for volume production. The reverse engineering approach allows many complex design issues to be appreciated in the context of the practical realization of a commercial tool. Comparisons with current-generation tools show the continuing evolution path and new design outcomes.},

abstract={The unit operations lab brings together a significant number of educational goals for the students: experiencing a broad range of equipment and instrumentation, enhancing teaming skills, learning to analyze experimental data, and developing written and oral communication skills. To help improve the students' overall learning in laboratory so as to better prepare them for industry and/or graduate research, we have (1) created a new lecture course on engineering experimentation to accompany the laboratory, (2) increased the emphasis on experimental planning and data analysis for each lab project, (3) implemented a peer-review and report revision procedure, (4) require students to follow industry standards for recording data in laboratory notebooks, and (5) completely revised the department's Lab Manual to reflect these changes in emphasis. This paper describes the organization and effectiveness of our revised laboratory sequence in comparison with our previous approach.},

abstract={Engineers often prefer to work with processes, particularly those that allow for assumptions, inputs, and outputs. Unfortunately, engineers seldom pursue diversity management as perhaps a secondary career field. In this paper, organizational diversity is represented by an engineering-like process having three primary phases and a supporting phase. The Leading Diversity Process Model (LDPM) is described by a modified pyramid with four parts defined as accepting differences, understanding differences, valuing differences, and role models. These same terms are often used in diversity conversations and literature; however, the current success story is derived from the manner in which the four components are defined and linked together to form a process. Like most engineering processes, the diversity model is receptive to creativity and innovation, along with standard problem-solving methodologies. Since July 2002, the LDPM has been presented to diverse audiences, including students, faculty, military leaders, and equal opportunity professionals. This paper offers an abbreviated discussion of the evolving description of each part of the model, followed by a brief summary of audience reaction to date.},

abstract={The companies that participate in the Joint Arizona Consortium for Manufacturing and Engineering Education for Tomorrow (JACME 2T) have expressed concern about the preparation process for future Chief Engineers and other technical leaders. There are two principal factors: the current generation is approaching retirement and the challenges of future technology demand an even greater combination of breadth and depth of understanding. A series of short courses has been prepared to address some of the skills required by potential chief engineers. The courses can be taken individually or they can be combined into a non-academic certificate. To formulate the certificate requirements, we followed the methodology used by the participating companies to design complex products. A detailed evaluation of the chief engineer job specification and skills led to an analysis of best practice and courses already available to JACME 2T and the companies. The translation into specific course modules was undertaken by the authors and with additional contributions from academic and industry experts. The full certificate will be delivered in 2004 and it has potential to be extended as a component of a distance MS degree within the Arizona universities.},

The course relied almost entirely on active learning techniques using student project work, and included the development of oral and written communication skills. Student and faculty assessment of the learning objectives of this course are included in the paper. Although open to all engineering and technology students, the mechatronics course was composed of two groups: undergraduate mechanical engineering students and graduate level technology students. The students were divided into groups of two or three and given a new project to complete for each of the first ten weeks of the course. At the completion of each project, the students were required to prepare a ten-minute PowerPoint presentation describing their project. The projects included material such as building an analog to digital converter, using a transistor H-bridge for motor control, construction of digital logic circuits, the use of proximity sensors, and the creation of music using a microprocessor. The final six weeks of the semester were used for the students to complete a design project of their choosing. They were required to submit a written project proposal, complete with deliverables and a timeline, before beginning the project. At the completion of their final projects, the students were required to prepare an oral presentation of their project and present it to a group of other students and faculty.},

abstract={Nothing captures the imagination more than a hands-on, highly-relevant and interactive experience. This paper will describe Engineering 100 at the US Air Force Academy, a new freshman core course designed to introduce and motivate first-year students towards the engineering fields. Cadets are introduced to five engineering disciplines: aeronautical, astronautical, electrical, mechanical, and civil. By the end of the course, emphasizing just-in-time teaching and learning, the students will use each discipline to design, build, and fly a boost glider (modified model airplane) of their own creation. They use aeronautical engineering o to design the plane, astronautical engineering to launch it (using a rocket motor), electrical engineering to control it during flight, mechanical engineering to employ sturdy construction techniques, and civil engineering to build an appropriate launching pad. Emphasis is on real-world design, a systems approach to project management, and close interaction with faculty serving as coaches and mentors. This course's organizing project gives plenty of opportunity for creativity and enough breadth to touch on all appropriate disciplines. Students are organized in small problem-solving design teams. Traditional lectures and evaluations are replaced with web-based instruction and hands-on projects. Computer tools are employed where appropriate, and students are evaluated on both individual comprehension and group execution of the project. Throughout the semester, design teams deliver two oral presentations and a final written report. The course gives students early experience wrestling with challenging educational outcomes; students apply the systems engineering approach, frame and resolve ill-defined problems, use technology, exercise their intellectual curiosity, work with others, and communicate orally and in writing. Various assessment methods aid the instructors in determining course effectiveness, student comprehension, and student motivation toward pursuing engineering degrees.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship education at Lehigh University has been recently enhanced by substantial institutional investments in new academic programs, the development of a campus center for student entrepreneurs and several grants from federal, state and private organizations. One such grant is from the Kauffman Foundation to build a Lehigh Entrepreneurial Network (LEN) of alumni to assist and advise student entrepreneurs. The effort requires the partnership of several academic programs, such as Lehigh's Integrated Product Development, Integrated Business and Engineering and Design Arts along with several internal organizations including Lehigh's Alumni Association, the Development office and the University's new thrust in innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship led by the Vice Provost for Research and the Dean of the College of Business and Economics. The LEN is a critical resource to: 1) help guide successful student e-teams through the product design, development, production ramp-up and market introduction phases of new product development, 2) help the students acquire seed funding, and 3) when appropriate be part of the management team in the startup phase of their businesses. The paper will describe a work in progress including the design and implementation of the Lehigh Entrepreneurial Network, its vision, goals, program components and evaluation mechanisms as part of the development entrepreneurial environment at Lehigh University.},

abstract={The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has adopted a revised set of criteria for accrediting engineering programs. Nevertheless, as in the past, civil engineering departments will be required to demonstrate proficiency in specific subject areas which are included in the ABET program criteria. This paper investigates, according to civil engineering students, the level at which their understanding of various subjects required by ABET and listed in the Program Criteria for Civil and Similarly Named Engineering Programs and the General Criteria (Professional Component) has been enhanced by being involved with the steel bridge and concrete canoe projects. The results are also compared with students who have practical civil engineering experience. In particular, the findings suggest that students who are directly involved with project work believe that four areas have been greatly enhanced. They include: structural engineering, project management/scheduling and estimating, constructability and team work. Understanding of engineering codes and standards, health and safety issues, materials engineering, and ethical considerations are also perceived to be enhanced. Furthermore, the results complement documentation from the American Institute of Steel Construction including comments from students participating in the steel bridge competition.},

abstract={Seeking to understand what and how students are learning about writing in its first-year engineering course, we have implemented an assessment project for Polytechnic University's core engineering course. Building on an innovative Writing Consultant program that already was implemented for EG 1004, Introduction to Engineering and Design, the assessment project draws several projects from English composition instruction to improve the communications skills of engineering students. Through the generous support of the Engineering Information Foundation (EIF), we were able to develop the program and implement it in three sections in the Fall 2003 semester, providing valuable insights into the assessment process and this project in particular. The project has continued in Spring 2004, expanding its scope and building on the lessons learned from the fall. This interim report describes the original conception of the program, the results obtained in the fall semester, and presents the improvements made to the project based on those results. The project was successful in creating a dialogue between students and instructors, and among instructors, about the assessment of writing. This dialogue allowed instructors to quickly correct student misconceptions, gave students a critical standpoint for evaluating their own writing, and offered them a forum to discuss their writing issues in a nonthreatening setting before getting a formal grade on a report.},

abstract={We have all heard our students groan as we assign them a project. Most of us accept this sound as the natural order of things, but have we really listened to what the students are telling us? Have they been the first to recognize that we are asking our students to do too many projects? The impetus for utilizing projects in a wide variety of courses comes from many sources. Industry prefers to hire graduates who have experience working in teams. They are also interested in graduates who have the skills to combine knowledge from a variety of areas and synthesize this knowledge to complete a project. In order to meet a variety of ABET criteria such as, the ability to function effectively on teams and the ability to apply creativity in the design of systems, components, or processes, educators have added projects to their courses. With projects appearing in nearly every course, from Economic Analysis to Design of Machine Elements to Circuits, has the use of projects to meet external customer requirements affected the learning experience of our internal customers? There is no doubt that projects are useful, interesting, and challenging additions to the learning experience. However, the questions still remain: -Are We Asking Our Students to Do Too Many Projects? -Has the use of projects to meet external customer requirements had a negative impact on the learning experience of our internal customers? In order to gain insight and more definitive answers to these questions, members of the Engineering Technology program at the University of Dayton conducted a survey of engineering technology programs nationwide. An analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for improvement are included in this paper.},

Users of ALTE can develop and remotely execute a variety of laboratory experiments over the Internet. Execution of the experiment hardware is controlled by a lab station personal computer (PC) linked directly to the device under test (DUT). Users first login to a management server that provides authentication and ensures that time has been reserved. It then re-directs their browser to the appropriate lab station for the experiment they are about to run. The management server also stores experiment procedures needed by students to perform the lab.},

abstract={The capstone design course is used by many engineering programs to provide students in their final year of training an opportunity to integrate knowledge from coursework and other sources in order to provide a solution for an engineering problem. The strategy for conducting the course, the process, implementation, and expectations vary between programs and disciplines. Often, there are conflicts or inconsistencies in expectations between course instructors, as well as between students and instructors. In many cases there appears to be no 'systematic' way for arriving at project ideas. Students are sometimes offered a list of potential topics, or asked to brainstorm and submit topics for approval. This non-methodical approach has resulted in a catalogue of poorly-conceived products showing a dearth of creativity and poverty of innovations. This paper discusses a pre-capstone course to guide students through the process of idea-production, selection of a title for a creative product or system, and a plan for development.},

abstract={During the academic years of 2001-2003 Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology participated in a NSF sponsored project to determine The Impact of Calculus Reform on Long-term Student Performance. The project was broken down into three major components. The first component was to compare registrar data for students who had taken a traditional calculus curriculum with those who had taken calculus in a "reformed" curriculum. The second component was a questionnaire to discover the views of graduating seniors to the use of technology in their education. The third component was a series of interviews with graduating seniors. We obtained their responses to their calculus and engineering education. This report will focus on the responses made by senior engineering students attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology to the questionnaire concerning the use of technology in their undergraduate education. The results of the survey showed that the engineering students at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology used mathematical software or graphics calculators not only in mathematics courses but in other courses either as part of the class, or to check their homework. The students also believe that learning how to use mathematical software or graphics calculators is a very important part of their educational experience, and in many, cases helped students to better understand the mathematical concepts presented.},

abstract={Using an individual's iris pattern, voice, facial characteristics or fingerprints for identification enables a high degree of certainty of a person's identity, especially when used together. This form of identifying people can be used in a variety of applications, including allowing physical access to secure sites, making financial transactions, allowing access to networked computers, or identifying a terrorist in a public place. Due to the potential for research that this relatively new field holds, and its importance to homeland defense, we have built a new Biometric Signal Processing Laboratory, and developed a new course in biometric signal processing. This course was designed for seniors in the electrical engineering major so that they could become familiar with the basis for these new technologies. The course was organized to give the students some background in image processing, from which the identification algorithms are formulated, and had them design simple identification algorithms. The students were exposed to state-of-the-art commercial equipment, including iris scan, fingerprint and facial recognition hardware and software. The course was comprised of three lecture hours and two lab hours each week. We discuss the topics that were covered, the equipment in the lab that supported each topic, the projects that the students performed, field trips, guest lecturers and related senior design projects.},

abstract={In recent years, Universities have placed a stronger emphasis on research and scholarship as a critical element not only for faculty members to be tenured and promoted but also being used in their performance evaluations. Engineering Technology (ET) faculty members are not an exception. However, ET faculty is a more heterogeneous group than their colleges in Engineering programs, having very diverse experiences and backgrounds. A common factor for all ET departments is the emphasis on undergraduate education and the limited human and infrastructure requirements to conduct the traditionally considered research activities. All this introduces newer elements that need to be considered when defining the activities that can be considered under the umbrella of scholarship in Engineering Technology. The goal of this paper is not to solve all the problems that exist today in defining and understanding scholarship in our field, but to share the author's experiences in developing his own scholarship activities as an ET faculty member. The author firmly believes that scholarship activities in Engineering Technology will ultimately help to strengthen our own academic identity.},

abstract={Machine Learning has traditionally been a topic of research and instruction in computer science and computer engineering programs. Yet, due to its wide applicability in a variety of fields, its research use has expanded in other disciplines, such as electrical engineering, industrial engineering, civil engineering, and mechanical engineering. Currently, many undergraduate and first-year graduate students in the aforementioned fields do not have exposure to recent research trends in Machine Learning. This paper reports on a project in progress, funded by the National Science Foundation under the program Combined Research and Curriculum Development (CRCD), whose goal is to remedy this shortcoming. The project involves the development of a model for the integration of Machine Learning into the undergraduate curriculum of those engineering and science disciplines mentioned above. The goal is increased exposure to Machine Learning technology for a wider range of students in science and engineering than is currently available. Our approach of integrating Machine Learning research into the curriculum involves two components. The first component is the incorporation of Machine Learning modules into the first two years of the curriculum with the goal of sparking student interest in the field. The second is the development of new upper level Machine Learning courses for advanced undergraduate students. The paper will focus on the details of the integration of a machine learning module (related to neural networks) applied to a Numerical Analysis class, taught to sophomores and juniors in the Engineering Departments at the University of Central Florida. Furthermore, it will report results on the assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the module by the students taking the class. Finally, based on the assessment results some conclusions will be drawn regarding the potential of the modules in attracting undergraduate students into research, specifically machine-learning research.},

abstract={Colleges and universities strive to prepare graduates for the demands of a technology-infused business world where familiarity with both engineering and management skills is necessary. Bucknell's Institute for Leadership in Technology and Management is an example of a program created for that purpose. The structure and themes of the ILTM program were devised to meet the needs of industry; however, since its founding a decade ago, the business world has continued to evolve in its technologies and purposes. Assessment and improvement of the ILTM program, and others like it, are needed to ensure that graduates are truly meeting the needs of employers. The purpose of this study will be to revisit the foundation of ILTM and determine the continuing relevance of its themes and structure in today's business world. Initial effort was made at the time of founding to consult business leaders, so this study will return to that concept by surveying ILTM graduates now working in industry along with middle managers and executives who can give insight into the current demands for engineering and management graduates. The results of the survey, which includes both quantitative and qualitative responses, is compared to previously published rankings of desirable skills for graduates.},

abstract={Rowan University has developed a program that fosters synergistic interaction between industry and academia. This program provides a mechanism for performing industrially sponsored research or design projects in an academic environment. One of the unique features of this program is its integration into the undergraduate curriculum at our university. Participation in this Engineering Clinic program is required of all Engineering undergraduate students for all four semesters of their junior and senior years. Students work in multidisciplinary teams on semester-long or year-long projects that are supported by external sponsors. In addition to providing a mechanism to introduce emerging technologies relevant to regional industries, the clinics provide the students with exposure to industrial projects with real deadlines and deliverables, and an opportunity to develop their project management, teamwork and oral and written communication skills. This program offers the industrial sponsor a cost-effective approach to problem solving with potential for a high return on investment, through technical assistance from advanced undergraduate engineering students supervised by faculty. In addition, the company has the opportunity to watch for potential interns and employees for future hire. This paper presents case studies which examine successful synergistic interaction between industry and academia through the Rowan Engineering Clinic Program. The case studies focus on the integration of industrial problem solving into the curriculum, the development of three successful and different relationships with companies in the region, and benefits to students, faculty and industry.},

Both the EIET and Manufacturing programs have 2+2 articulation agreements with Iowa community colleges. This paper presents a detailed study on a capstone senior design project to design and construct a solar powered outdoor digital display for promoting environmentally friendly technologies in Iowa. This paper also illustrates how a student capstone design project can serve as an excellent marketing tool for engineering technology and industrial technology programs. The authors determined that an innovative use of environmentally friendly technology would be an outdoor marquee to advertise events and programs in the department. Students designed a panel mount frame using CAD software. Analysis of dynamic forces that could affect the outdoor display insured that the design could withstand strong summer windstorms. The system includes three 100 W solar panels, panel frame built by students and production lab technicians, electrical box, two deep cycle batteries, one charge controller, surge arrester for lightning strikes, switches, DC fuses, DC fluorescent lights directly connected to battery output, 120 ft underground data cable connected to a PC from the outdoor display, and a digital display with six inches letter size. Fabrication of the display framework, concrete footings, and electrical connection to the indoor control unit took nearly six months. The digital display has been an excellent marketing tool for the announcements of the undergraduate and graduate programs in the Industrial Technology Department at UNI.},

abstract={The 21 st century promises to be an extraordinarily challenging era. The demands of a new technology revolution, globalization, pressing social concerns and a renaissance in business ethics all call for a new kind of engineer. The 21 st century engineer must possess not only technical skills but also interdisciplinary skills and a firm foundation for making ethical decisions. Engineering schools have a responsibility to develop our students' leadership skills in order that they may improve the quality of life through science and engineering. How will we know if we have properly prepared our students? Students and employers tend to rate graduate programs by their perceived quality, but are our current assessment methods adequate for the future? Is there one good way to evaluate and compare graduate programs? Are universities expanding their use of quantitative metrics for evaluating their programs? A number of methods are used to evaluate engineering programs. Among them are the Baldrige Education Criteria for Performance Excellence, the ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, and U.S. News and World Report magazine ranking of America's Best Colleges. This paper presents the assessment method used by the School of Engineering at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. We use the Malcolm Baldrige Education Criteria for Performance Excellence to assess our overall performance. Then we measure our performance against our mission and the program objectives and outcomes. We will discuss our experience with this assessment method and provide some comparisons with other assessment methods.},

abstract={What are the benefits of diversity in graduate engineering education? Reasons for increasing diversity among undergraduates also apply at the graduate level-a larger pool of highly trained workers, increased technical expertise among the overall population, the potential for enhanced innovation due to multiple perspectives, and greater economic and professional opportunities for the students involved. Moreover, engineers with graduate training will be at the forefront of leadership and change, in both academia and industry, giving additional impetus to efforts to increase the diversity of this group. However, while the percentages of women and minorities earning engineering graduate degrees are increasing, they still (except for women at the masters' level) lag behind the percentages earning bachelor's degrees. Many initiatives for improving diversity at the undergraduate, K-12, and faculty levels, as well as extensive industry programs, already exist or are being developed. But at the graduate level initiatives are more limited and their success rate has been lower. While some programs for increasing diversity at the undergraduate level can be extended to the graduate level, other factors must also be taken into account. For example, at the undergraduate level only 7.1% of B.S. in engineering degrees awarded in 2002 went to foreign nationals, while at the graduate level the percentages were 42.6% for M.S. degrees and 54.9% for Ph.D. degrees respectively. This greater cultural diversity certainly impacts both understanding and dealing with issues of diversity in graduate engineering education. Here we discuss some of the major issues whose impact on diversity in graduate education needs assessment. These include both issues which are crucial at the undergraduate level, such as workplace, climate, critical mass, and support systems, and also issues specific to the graduate level, such as increased family and financial responsibilities and the structure of graduate degree programs and academic engineering research.},

abstract={Undergraduate engineering is changing at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology through Engenius Solutions. Funded by a grant from the Lilly Foundation, Engenius Solutions allocates financial and intellectual resources in an effort to help undergraduate engineers think like entrepreneurs as well as engineers in their careers. Project ideas are solicited from students, faculty, staff and the general public for evaluation by Engenius Solutions. Those ideas that meet the specific criteria establish by Engenius Solutions are accepted and the idea is then developed and prototyped by teams composed of undergraduate engineers. Engenius Solutions then provides the necessary resources to assist their clients in commercializing the developed idea. The organization is led by four undergraduate students who are overseen, but not hindered by, a group of six faculty and staff members. This paper will present an overview of Engenius Solutions including the goals of the program and its organizational structure. A discussion of the objective of the organization, to increase entrepreneurship among undergraduates by allowing students to manage their own company in an effort to allow engineers to become more familiar with business and more comfortable when handling interactions between entrepreneurs and engineers, is included along with multiple aspects of the projects including Intellectual Property protection, business plan development support, market analysis, prototyping, and the design process.},

abstract={Visits to construction sites are ideally complementing our classroom instruction for construction engineering and management students. However, various complicating issues, such as unavailability of construction projects during the academic semesters and impracticality due to construction site risk for a large group of students make it impossible to rely on site visits. Considerable pedagogical advantages can be achieved by the integration of the contemporary information technology (IT) and visualization tools in teaching engineering technology. Although the classroom environment in Engineering and Construction Science is highly structured by the instructor, teaching students to be critical thinkers is essential in the virtual classroom of the future. The objective of this research was to develop a virtual tour of a reinforced concrete building construction using 3D animation and walkthrough. All the techniques that were used in this research employed a generic programming architecture, which was discipline independent and could be adapted to any other similar domain. These visualization techniques can be valuable aids not only in teaching in the classroom but also an effective self-directed tool for open learning via the web.},

abstract={Over the last two years, Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Aviation Technology (AT) students at Purdue University have been collaborating and competing in several aviation related design-build projects. This paper will describe three such projects: The Personal lifting vehicle (PLV), the lighter than air vehicle (Blimp), and the Hovercraft. Elements of collaboration, competition, and design-build strategies were utilized in an effort to increase student motivation. In the first project students of ME and AT worked together to design and build a Personal Lifting Vehicle (PLV); a prototype was built but the team was unable to satisfactorily resolve some control problems with the vehicle. For the second project a design was chosen that could more realistically be achieved, and the effort was to culminate in a race between the two design blimps. The element of competition greatly improved the motivation of the students and both teams successfully constructed and raced the 12 feet long radio controlled blimps. For the third project one team of ME students and a combined team of AT and ME students competed. The teams were tasked with the design and manufacture of a full-scale one-person hovercraft. Both teams successfully built a hovercraft, but only the hovercraft of the combined AT/ME team was tested. The ME hovercraft was not tested due to safety concerns. These projects have created considerable interest among faculty members from other departments within the University, some of who have expressed a desire to participate in future projects of the type. Suggestions have also been made that collaborative competitions might be conducted in the future between teams from Purdue University and other universities here and abroad.},

abstract={The Kate Gleason College of Engineering (KGCOE) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has implemented a college-wide initiative to emphasize multidisciplinary design in the senior capstone experience. The mission of this three-quarter sequence is to develop engineers who have an end-to-end life cycle prospective of product realization. Problem solving, teamwork, market-oriented product development, and technical communication are key experiential components of the program. Supplemental topics in innovation, entrepreneurship, and contemporary issues in product development, are fostered through lectures and workshops. The capstone program is coordinated by a team of faculty representatives from each participating department. A standard set of assessment tools is employed by the coordinators, faculty team mentors, project sponsors and external reviewers. The design of a state-of-the-art 8,500 sq.ft., multi-disciplinary design workshop is underway. It will provide team work spaces as they develop and analyze concepts, and support for assembly and testing. This facility is made possible by recent gifts from local foundations and industries. At steady state, approximately 400 students will work concurrently on approximately 60 projects. This paper discusses the educational objectives, structure, and management of this multidisciplinary capstone program.},

In the larger project, students were evaluated at various points in time to assess their levels of learning and retention. The purpose of the formative study was not to assess students, but to evaluate the pretests, posttests, and examination questions that were later used to assess students. These instruments were tested for usability, reliability, and validity. In the formative study, the instruments were completed by students in two sections of a sophomore level mechanics course. The resulting data were compared via standard statistical techniques and the instruments were found to be reliable. The data were also analyzed for evidence of criterion-related validity and the instruments were found to be highly valid. After some changes were made based on student responses, the instruments were also found to be usable. This paper describes the formative study and the findings on the usability, reliability, and validity of the assessment instruments.},

abstract={Modern conveniences abound in the world today. This is sometimes not evident in graduate classrooms. While innovative teaching techniques are often discussed in regard to undergraduate courses, they seem to be less frequently seen in graduate courses. This is unfortunate, as these tools may in many cases be of even more value in those courses. This paper will discuss the use of a variety of online tools in the teaching of the required graduate course in chemical engineering thermodynamics at New Jersey Institute of Technology. The tools include electronic lecture notes, online quizzes, web-based bulletin boards, electronic submission and grading of projects and papers, and online monitoring of course grades by the students. Use of these tools can help students whose learning style may not be well suited to the traditional lecture format. Many of these tools are also helpful in dealing with the diversity of backgrounds found in core graduate courses. Some differences are due to the educational background of the students. Others are due to their cultural background, as most graduate programs typically have many international students. Use of online tools can help to alleviate some of the problems in dealing with this diversity. There are also some pitfalls in using these tools that should be avoided. The paper will address both sides of the issue of using online tools to supplement the teaching of a required graduate course.},

abstract={One of the problems we face in 4-year engineering technology programs is to motivate students to work on a senior project that is based on the research methodology. Most students choose instead traditional design projects. The design projects are good for integrating knowledge from various courses, but students do not get a chance to work on new innovative areas where they have to learn new ideas and new methodologies. The project described in this paper, although not a new technique, gave the student a chance to work in a research related field. As part of the preparation for the work the student was given basic information required for any research project. A review of various related statistical concepts was also completed. This paper reflects the work done in this senior project course by the student and the advisor. The paper describes two work sampling studies, one each on a residential project and a commercial project.},

This paper describes a model curriculum development strategy to create user-friendly material for students and the instructor. The development team consists of faculty from community colleges, ASU East and industry subject matter experts (SMEs). To maximize the efficiency of the development team an Online Authoring Tool is developed to generate the curriculum materials. This modular curriculum is competency based and industry validated with the goal of producing work-ready graduates. The online tool structure allows all potential authors to upload their material into the system. Based on their development role, it provides access to all (authors, editor and publisher) to review and revise the material. The tool also has the capability of automatically saving each version of the material for logging the changes. When the author uploads the final version of the material the editor makes the final changes and informs the publisher to publish the material to the site. The instructor material covers the information to prepare for the laboratory. The student material covers the details of each laboratory exercise with several learning objectives.},

abstract={A unique baccalaureate degree program called Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT) was developed at James Madison University in the early 1990's in response to industry need for university graduates with a broad knowledge of science and technology and excellent analytical and problem-solving skills. The goal was to produce university graduates with the ability to manage a broad range of technologies and solve science, technology and engineering related problems. A second important goal was to attract and retain students, including minorities, who ordinarily would not have selected an engineering program. Accomplishing both goals from a pedagogical viewpoint required a paradigm shift in the way science and engineering courses are traditionally taught in universities. It required the design of interdisciplinary courses with careful and deliberate integration of concepts from a broad range of disciplines of engineering science and technology. These courses were such that they involved more than one faculty and therefore required some form of team teaching. In this paper, we discuss some of the merits and demerits of the team teaching concepts that have been employed in some of the ISAT courses.},

abstract={This is the first of four papers in the special panel session focusing on issues driving reform of faculty reward systems to advance professional graduate engineering education for creative engineering practice and leadership of technological innovation to enhance U.S. competitiveness. This panel session is in direct response to the urgency of engineering education reform and improvement of faculty reward systems, voiced by Wm. A. Wulf, president of the National Academy of Engineering at the 2002-Main Plenary Address to the American Society of Engineering Education. Since the Grinter Report, scientific research has become a primary condition for tenure and promotion at many of the nation's schools of engineering across the country. In his seminal work, Scholarship Reconsidered, Ernest Boyer identified the need to broaden the range and the definition of scholarship beyond the limits of scholarship of research and discovery. As the panel overview paper, this paper introduces the need to implement a comprehensive faculty reward system for those professional-oriented adjunct faculty from industry and for those professional-oriented core faculty within schools of engineering and technology, who are at the leading edge of advancing the practice of engineering through their teaching, industrial engagement, and original professional scholarly work relevant to creative engineering practice and its leadership for technology development. The paper raises fundamental questions that must be answered to design a complementary faculty reward template of creative professional scholarly work, teaching, and engagement for high-caliber engineering professionals in parallel to the academic scientific research template, which predominantly exists at schools of engineering and technology across the nation.},

abstract={Service learning (SL) is a pedagogy that integrates community service into the academic experience. Studies have shown that service learning can positively impact student learning, provides a rich environment for students to learn the "soft" skills that are often difficult to teach in traditional classes, can increase retention in participants, and can broaden the view of engineering among the participants. Service-learning can greatly enhance the services of local community service organizations that lack the technical staffs and/or resources to take full advantage of current technology. The potential benefits of service learning have motivated the Department of Freshman Engineering at Purdue to begin implementing service learning into the first-year engineering courses. 143 students participated in an service-learning experience at Purdue University in the Fall semester of 2003. Student and community partner evaluations have shown initial success and in depth investigations are underway to characterize these experiences.},

abstract={Engineering and technology students often struggle with comprehension of thermal science topics, due to the seemingly abstract nature of the topics when compared with materials or machine design concepts. For example, it is difficult for some students to "see" the conservation of thermal energy explained by the First Law of Thermodynamics, yet they can easily visualize transformations between potential and kinetic energy in a simple mechanical system. Laboratory experiments help alleviate the difficulties in some cases, but even a lab-based introductory thermal science course in the Mechanical Engineering Technology department at Purdue University does not consistently improve student understanding of the basic principles. This paper describes the development and implementation of simple open-ended projects, used in conjunction with the laboratory portion of the course, as a means for increased student understanding. Project topics have ranged from proving basic equations to investigating more complex problems, such as the effect of window treatments on cooling requirements or the feasibility of alternative energy sources. Results from Fall 2003 semester projects are presented.},

abstract={Massachusetts is leading the integration of engineering into K-12 education by adopting a statewide science and technology/engineering framework. To meet the need for teachers who can deliver this curriculum, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team from Smith College and Amherst Public Schools to design a workshop for pre-service teachers of all grade levels and subject areas. Through this workshop, we intend for students to increase their familiarity with the engineering field and state frameworks, learn about the engineering design process, develop an understanding of how engineering can be used in classrooms of many disciplines, and develop an understanding of the relationship between engineering and the liberal arts. This paper describes how the curriculum was implemented through a one-week workshop for 21 education students, representing a wide range of disciplines and grades. In this workshop, we used a variety of hands-on activities intended to meet the needs of each learner. Activities included laboratory explorations of content knowledge and delivery according to grade level, application of the engineering design process through redesign and design projects, student teaching of engineering topics, and team development of interdisciplinary engineering curricula. Pre- and post-workshop student surveys indicate that the intended learning outcomes of the workshop were met. The experience positively impacted how students viewed engineering and their intentions for including it in their teaching.},

abstract={The Engineering Entrepreneurs Program at North Carolina State University is a program in which undergraduate students participate in design teams formed around corporate technology start-up company themes. Through funding from the NSF-sponsored SUCCEED (Southeastern Universities and Colleges Coalition for Engineering EDucation) Coalition, the Entrepreneurs Program aims to retain student interest in engineering by exposing undergraduate students to the design process early in their academic careers and by providing upper class students as mentors. Secondly, it seeks to teach students "real-world" skills such as teamwork, leadership, and the dynamics of entrepreneurship. Multiple approaches to assessment - qualitative means such as surveys and focus groups as well as quantitative methods such as longitudinal assessment of retention and GPA - triangulate on the benefit of the program. The design of program is discussed, so that it may serve as a model program. This model should be of value to anyone who is interested in providing vertically integrated, multidisciplinary, practice-based engineering design experiences.},

abstract={The U.S. Department of Energy, through its Office of Industrial Technologies, funds twenty-six university-based Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) to train graduate and undergraduate engineering students to provide medium-sized manufacturers with energy, waste, and productivity assessments (http://www.oit.doe.gov/iac/). 1 Presently, the IAC Program uses a well-established database to track savings resulting from recommendations generated during IAC site assessments (Muller, Barnish, and Kasten, 1998) 2. However, additional benefits are not quantified by the database. One additional benefit, the subject of this paper, is student learning. The training and experiences that students receive through the IAC Program provides industry with engineers with significant and diverse industrial experiences. Students are introduced to manufacturing environments and must perform their job functions within these environments. When they graduate they have experience in several industries, understand energy efficiency and can implement lean manufacturing techniques. This paper will review the IAC program at The University of Dayton, its learning tools, and the skills that students acquire. Finally, the paper will review the results of follow-up questionnaires from over 130 IAC alumni that discuss the impact of the LAC program on their careers.},

abstract={"Communicating Technical Information" (CTI) is one course in the Master of Engineering in Professional Practice (MEPP) offered online through the College of Engineering, UW-Madison. The participants in MEPP are mostly early and mid-career engineers seeking a technical alternative to an MBA. CTI fosters technical leadership by maintaining the best qualities of the living interactive classroom while also exploiting technologies for online course delivery through WebCT and Placeware. Besides an appropriate choice of technology and content, course design must consider the motivation of the targeted student population. Students in MEPP were surveyed to gauge the importance of technical leadership in this population's concepts of professional growth. Responses indicate a differentiation between business management and technical leadership, an ambition to learn and apply techniques of technical leadership as part of job effectiveness, and an appreciation of the importance of communication in effective technical leadership. Future work should define "technical leadership" in detail and evaluate the motivations of engineers to develop appropriate skills. Finally, this is an age of information, technical innovation, and intense competition; business and industry should be surveyed to evaluate their resolve and motivation to foster "technical leadership" as part of the engineering culture.},

abstract={Design is the central activity of engineering and the focus of undergraduate engineering education. Effective teaching and learning of underlying engineering science and the principles of engineering design can be readily accomplished in instrumentation courses, through the completion of mini-design projects relative to the measurement of common variables found in engineering systems, such as temperature, pressure, stress, fluid flow, motion, sound, etc. This paper presents and discusses typical examples of highly affordable mini-design projects that have been implemented and used during the instruction of engineering students in a standard introductory instrumentation course in the School of Engineering Technology at Northeastern University. These mini-design projects can be completed within the time constraints inherent to regular academic schedules, and provide students with an appreciation for the realities of engineering practice, in particular, those associated with time and money constrains. This teaching technique blends the perspectives of theoretical discussions in regular lectures and the subtleties encountered in the practice of engineering design. It seeks to develop proficiency through practice guided by concurrent knowledge and the recognizable dimensions and challenges of the engineering product development process. Using this educational approach, class assessment guided by the Technology Criteria 2000 (TC2K) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), effectively reflects satisfactory mastery of knowledge, and the desirable abilities students are expected to demonstrate, as established by TC2K.},

abstract={Researchers in VaNTH - a National Science Foundation (NSF) consortium of schools with strong bioengineering departments, namely Vanderbilt, Northwestern, the University of Texas at Austin, and the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology - have developed an enriched program for the undergraduates from other institutions who participate in their efforts through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs). Although the VaNTH REU program is designed primarily to involve these undergraduates in the VaNTH mission-the development of cutting edge curricular material for bioengineers that is based on research in the learning sciences about how bioengineers learn - the enriched program also helps students develop the core competencies necessary for professional success, such as problem analysis, team management, written and oral communication, and professional ethics. Students are mentored by professionals in ethics and communication, participate in special study groups, and complete a report and presentation based on their research. Preliminary evaluation of this enriched summer experience points to its success and suggests that the REU program is a good setting for preparing undergraduates to be more capable members of their profession.},

abstract={The challenge of an education befitting a technologically knowledgeable workforce involves two fundamental components. It involves the preparedness of students implying a suitable education and the preparedness of the teacher. In order for teachers to keep pace with knowledge and skills akin to a technological age, they need resources for their students and themselves in the form of professional development. Therefore, this study sought to develop a needs assessment tool to acquire data to more effectively facilitate educational partnerships between K-12 and higher education systems, and engineering or technology-based businesses or industries. This research project involved developing and electronically administering two surveys - one for a sample of K-12 teachers in Iowa and one for a sample of technologically based business and industry in Iowa. The survey for teachers consisted of a self-assessment of content knowledge and utilization of best practices, and a composite of desirable partnership activities related to science, math, and technology. A second survey inventoried business/industry K-12 educational partnership activities and participation. The survey asked business/industry to identify their participation in various partnering activities and their view of the level of importance and effectiveness of those activities, as well as the resulting value that those partnering activities might have for their business/industry. Scores for partnering activities deemed "important" by teachers had similar correlations to the same list of activities for business/industry suggesting that it is the 'right time' to develop partnering relationships. However, participation in partnering activities was low. Barriers to educational partnering were explored and recommendations for further study are included.},

abstract={In this paper, we report the progress of the Bachelor of Arts in Engineering (BAE) Program (formerly named the ELITE program - Engineering with Liberal and Technical Education). The program is novel in that it leads to a BA in Engineering degree at the University of Arizona, a large land-grant institution. We have 25 students and we are becoming more established on campus with each additional semester. We have had 24 graduates with placement in both industry and graduate school. Each year approximately 60 students hear our informational presentations and seek information about the program. The program allows students exceptional flexibility in designing a degree program to meet their needs. Requirements ensure that-the students cover areas within engineering and outside of engineering and we focus on the application of technology. Our requirements are designed to be agile in that students can quickly piece together degree programs in "hot" areas. We have formulated research questions based on the needs of our key stakeholders. In this report, we present initial findings on three of the questions. Our results suggest that we are achieving our mission of keeping high quality students in engineering related fields and we have succeeded at developing and operating a program that allows students an opportunity to tailor an educational experience to their direct needs. We also have areas where we could improve, and suggestions and strategies are included.},

MECO is a curriculum construct joining subject matter in multiple courses over a four-semester sequence by introducing a large problem to be solved by collaboration. Through this integration, the overall function of a manufacturing engineer is better understood by the students. The MECO construct puts course content with context, and infuses it with a problem-solving atmosphere requiring exercise of communications skills.},

abstract={Over the past decade, a great deal of attention has been placed on capstone design projects in engineering technology. This has come as a result of criticisms of education institutions for not meeting the needs of industry. To that end, nearly all institutions have adopted a capstone experience. Many have instituted projects that include both design and fabrication. Some have utilized industry-sponsored projects. A few have even implemented an interdisciplinary approach, by including several students from different majors on the design team. Of course, all of these enhancements are to better simulate the "real world" and thus better prepare the students for the expectations of industry. After years of working through all the barriers, the Department of Engineering Technology at the University of Dayton currently requires a senior design experience that encompasses all the mentioned enhancements. Teams of electronic, mechanical, manufacturing and industrial engineering technology students work with a company on a real project. The teams are given full responsibility from project definition and concept generation to the fabrication and testing of a device. The purpose of this paper is to share the experience and discuss some of the details on the implementation.},

abstract={To prepare students for the 21st century global environment, Consulter groups and ABET have encouraged engineering schools to make provision for leadership development within their programs. The model envisioned by the corporate/industrial community would aim to have students achieve competency in business practices equivalent to the proficiencies realized in engineering subject areas. One method for achieving this is to ask students to respond to "Request for Proposal" (RFPs) in which inter- and multi-discipline design teams "compete" with alternate solutions. Corporate representatives provide realistic scenarios through active participation in such courses. These "clients" require the students to use realistic project management tools and reinforce planning and economic aspects of a design without neglecting the technical aspects of the project. While such approaches have proven successful, they neglect an important element of leadership development - the "ntrepreneurial" aspect. To this end, we describe an alternative scenario that we have designated the "venture capital" (VC) approach. It retains the important feature in which corporate representation is retained but requires students to initiate their own projects (as opposed to providing an RFP). Class discussions provide information for development of a Business Plan including: purpose, use of tile technology, market analysis and forecast, financial plan, and management. Student projects are depicted and include: Voice biometrics wherein an individual's speech pattern is digitized and stored to produce a "voiceprint"; an electronic tuner for selecting signals at specific frequencies and sound reproduction; an electronic audiometer for testing hearing loss. Course assessment results and evaluation are explained.},

abstract={At Penn State Altoona, as a senior design project in the Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology department, we have developed an instrumentation system to measure the dynamic response of skis under real time skiing conditions. The intent is to monitor the ski response during different styles of high performance use. Consequently, initial modeling and static testing were required to determine both sensor type and placement to capture the critical parameters during a specific ski maneuver. Apart from the determination of sensor type and optimum placement, environmentally hardening (handling of large temperature variations and large and rapid loading) of the system proved challenging. The specific measurements performed were ski displacement and acceleration. In this work, we will discuss the design and construction processes, the testing processes, and the specific results of the static and dynamic testing. This information and testing system, which is coordinated with ski manufacturers, will then be available for the future redesigning of skis for specific performance constraints such as freestyle or slalom.},

abstract={In July 2001, the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) was established in the Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering Technology (CAET), the School of Engineering, Technology, and Computer Science (ETCS), Indiana-Purdue University Ft. Wayne (IPFW). The CAET department has a long and productive history of community interaction on many levels including service learning projects, formal grant contracts, technical service agreements, and continuing education. In the past 4 years, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs created an environment on campus that nurtured and supported financially the creation of several centers of excellence. The CBE is the first center in the School of ETCS. The creation of the center was a natural evolution of work that the CAET department had been involved with for many years. The CBE presented a vehicle that allowed the department to focus its efforts and to properly publicize the services it had to offer the region of NE Indiana. This paper summarizes the proposal submitted for initial funding from the VCAA office. The five-year plan has the CBE as an income generating, self-sustaining enterprise at the end of the initial five years of operation, with some financial support from the university during this development phase. Projects that were part of the first and second year effort are described. The CBE has already made a significant impression with local government and the professional community, and has established a strong reputation in service learning.},

Similarly, potential students with engineering backgrounds do not understand the differences in engineering management and business programs. Even many employers do not fully appreciate the potential engineering management programs present for significant organizational change. Even within the discipline, the focus varies between an emphasis on soft skills and quantitative skills. This paper proposes a research agenda for the engineering management division that targets examination of these issues and long-term definition of the discipline by using educational assessment and effectiveness measures and also by study of skills necessary for student success in the work place.},

Three principal areas of student impact were identified. These were: (1) Improvement of the quality of engineering students, (2) Development of student social skills, and (3) Enhancement of student motivation to continue the learning experience. This paper recounts how equation solvers, interactive software, and hands-on projects were incorporated into sophomore level integrated courses and documents the observations, lessons learned, and conclusions from the experience. Student participants improved in understanding and applying fundamental principles, developed the ability to identify and define problems, knew how to evaluate alternative solutions, were better trained to communicate ideas, both orally and written, and were able to use technology for setting, solving, and presenting problems, in addition, the students enhanced their social skills by working in teams and by enhanced student/faculty interactions.},

abstract={This is the fourth paper in the panel session of the National Collaborative Task Force on reshaping professional graduate education in engineering and technology that is more relevant to the needs of industry to ensure a strong U.S. engineering workforce. As the final and integrating paper of the panel session, this paper ties together the three previous papers and focuses on leading change for purposeful action at comprehensive research universities to implement this needed innovation into the mainstream of university operations across the country. The National Collaborative Task Force believes that innovation in engineering education can be accomplished best at the graduate level through a national demonstration project effected by a critical mass of innovative leaders from a strong coalition of universities and industry who are committed to taking purposeful action for reform. The paper presents strategies to overcome systemic and institutional obstacles in implementing this significant transformation at comprehensive research universities across the country. Additionally, the paper builds upon recommendations of the National Academy of Engineering, ASEE, the Kellogg Commission, the Council on Competitiveness, the Council of Graduate Schools, and other calls for reform in engineering education. The National Task Force is playing a key role as change agent for this transformation with industry.},

abstract={A short design project was given concurrently to sophomore engineering students at the Kanazawa Institute of Technology (Ishikawa, Japan) and at the University of Houston (Texas, USA) as part of the first engineering design course taken in both curricula. Students were asked to design and build at least one low-cost device whose main purpose was to support a set of chopsticks while not in use. The project was introduced in the first week of the Japanese and US design classes with minimal guidance from the instructors to provide the engineers-to-be with a first experience in design. The (intentional) lack of technological challenge did not necessarily mean that the project was easy as each student population had to face its own challenges. The product to be designed, while foreign and mostly unknown to the US students, is very well known and deeply traditional in Japan. In general, the US students attempted to design devices with more than one function. Predictably, some of the US projects resulted in products, which despite their originality and functionality, were unsuitable for the Asian market as they violated some of the traditional cultural values of Asia. In the Japanese projects, the originality did not appear at the function level but in the way esthetics and recycle-ability were treated. Work samples submitted by both student groups are described and evaluated in this paper. Design trends are commented upon and analyzed in light of the cultural and behavioral characteristics of the two groups.},

abstract={At the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, students from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering all take a Mechatronics course during their sophomore or junior year. The course follows the textbook Mechatronics by Alciatore and Histand rather closely. For the lab projects, students use a small computer circuit board containing a PIC microcontroller. The computer circuit board was designed and built at the school. Students design interfaces for transducers and actuators to be controlled by the software executed on the PIC which they develop in the C language using the PCW compiler from CCS, Inc. The 16F876 PIC microcontroller used has a flash program memory so that compiled code can be downloaded in seconds, speeding the software development and debug cycle. Along with the standard quizzes, tests and labs, the students must complete two projects. One project is the construction and demonstration of a robot designed to run the IEEE Region V robotic contest. The other project is chosen by the student team. Each team must be multidisciplinary; it must have at least one ME and at least one EE or CompE. Student teams have become very successful at completing the increasingly imaginative projects they choose. Results from the five years over which the course has been developed show increases in teaming skills; increased cooperation among students of different departments leading to more multidisciplinary capstone design projects; increased multidisciplinary participation in student competitions such as IEEE Robotics, American Solar Challenge, and Formula SAE; increased levels of enjoyment as students succeed in real engineering projects (especially obvious as students cheer on their team's robot in the end of semester competition).},

abstract={C.P. Snow's famous 1959 Rede Lecture on the clash of the "Two Cultures": Art and Science continues to reverberate in the halls of science and engineering education. Snow's lecture brought to the surface what seemed apparent to most but never, until then, boldly stated; that there were two cultures, one of science and one of art that seemingly both can never be enjoyed by professionals who clearly must pick only one world to live in. In order to bridge this gap and to emphasize the richness that both cultures can provide the professional, engineering curriculums are requiring that the engineering students seriously take non-technical electives. The battle to gain the attention of an engineering student who is immersed into four 'heavy' courses in engineering and thus doesn't have time for Liberal Arts is not an easy battle to win. This paper will describe the author's efforts in integrating culture within engineering course work and provide examples of the Case Studies that have been used.},

abstract={A number of universities are seeking ways to increase their study abroad offerings. The Purdue University Aviation Technology Department began this process a few years back, and a plan was established for increasing student participation in various study abroad opportunities. A portion of the plan was to visit peer institutions in Europe, Asia, South America and North America, and establish relationships with educational institutions that match our curriculum or a part thereof. Last year, several universities in Europe were visited. This year a team of two faculty members, one industry representative and one student visited China. This paper will discuss the visitation of two aviation universities in China. The Purdue University and United Airlines partnership 1 enabled a meeting, and travel with the United representative in China and use of various resources of their office. In this paper the unique experiences encountered, and the future plans for cooperation with the Civil Aviation University of China and the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China are discussed. Six different options are being considered in part or collectively: (1) offer course work at Purdue University for Chinese and Purdue students (2) offer course work at the Civil Aviation University of China (CAUC) for Chinese and Purdue students (3) develop joint research and design projects between CAUC and Purdue University (4) develop a study abroad trip of two weeks or three weeks in which Purdue students accompanied by faculty will research an aviation related research project in China (5) pursue joint Purdue University and CAUC faculty research opportunities (6) develop a by semester or by year study abroad program. Meetings with the university presidents of both institutions and faculty members of both universities were very successful and they seemed eagerly interested to establish a relationship with Purdue University.},

The project was carried out to study use of portfolios as a means for authentic assessment of students. Portfolios have constituted the primary method of evaluation in fields such as art, architecture, modeling, photography, and journalism. The students in the study indicated that barriers exist during the creation of student portfolios to assess student learning, and that university, professional and regional standards be aligned to avoid duplication and repetition of the accreditation process.},

abstract={The Engineering Technology profession is more sensitive to the new changes in the engineering practice. The engineering technology programs in general and the civil engineering technology program in particular are not responding well to the demand in the engineering market. This causes the gap between the education and the engineering industry to widen continuously. The new ABET Criteria was a step in the right direction but was too little too late. What was accepted in the 1970s may not be accepted today as far as civil engineering technology curriculum is concerned. The civil engineering technology industry changed drastically lately while the civil engineering technology education changed a little. Five-year study at Gaston College of the Civil Engineering Technology two-year program will be presented. The study will focus on the factors affecting the survival rate, student academic performance, initial salary, and the waiting period before getting the first job after graduation. Techniques and procedures to enhance creative environment in the civil engineering technology program will be discussed. Reforming math and science courses in the engineering technology curriculum became a necessity to help engineering technology graduates survive with the new challenges in their careers. North Carolina statewide completion study for the Civil Engineering Technology program will be presented. The study shows the survival rate of the students in the engineering technology program. Several factors affecting the survival rate in the engineering technology program will be discussed.},

abstract={Engineering Economy is one of the most, if not the most, valuable required course(s) offered in most undergraduate engineering and engineering technology programs. The course is very important because most topics covered in it are used everyday in our personal and professional lives. Unfortunately, the importance of this course is greatly undermined as some students' have difficulties with the course. This paper will present the approaches I have utilized in teaching engineering economy to engineering technology students in the past ten years.},

abstract={Visualization in Technology Education (VisTE) is a standards-based initiative designed to promote the use of graphic visualization among grade 8-12 students to improve their higher order thinking, communication skills, and understanding of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. By using simple and complex visualization tools, students can conduct research, analyze, solve problems, and communicate major topics identified in the new ITEA Standards for Technological Literacy (STL) as well as topics aligned with national mathematics and science standards. Unfortunately, rigorously tested instructional materials to support such activities do not yet exist. Over three years, the project team will develop 12 discrete units. Units will encompass areas such as biotechnology, medical technology, communications, transportation, power & energy, and construction. While the curriculum is not developed for the post-secondary level, it is expected to have an impact on the students' understanding of key technologies and their ability to apply graphic communication tools in the exploration and conveyance of technology and engineering concepts. This presentation will provide an overview of the project.},

abstract={The Women in Engineering at The University of Texas (WE@UT) program, a two-day in-depth residential program, is designed to increase participant knowledge and understanding of engineering and technology through hands-on, technology-based team projects so well informed and solid educational and career decisions are made. The objectives of this program are (1) to encourage young women to explore engineering as a career choice; (2) to expose young women to technology across engineering disciplines and to build confidence in using technology; (3) to expose young women to female engineering role models (students, faculty, and industry professionals); (4) to establish an ongoing support network for young women interested in learning about engineering careers; and (5) to introduce young women to a university environment. The overall goal is to increase the enrollment of women in engineering programs at The University of Texas at Austin (UT). The pilot WE@UT program, held in July 2001 in conjunction with The University's on-campus honor student recruitment program, had an enrollment of 73 women out of 549 students invited to participate. Invited students had indicated an interest in either engineering or natural science on PSAT, SAT, or ACT tests. According to UT admissions information, 78 percent of those who attended WE@UT applied to UT compared to 32 percent of those who were invited but did not attend. In addition, 55 percent of those who attended WE@UT applied to the College of Engineering at UT compared to 6 percent of those who were invited but did not attend. By providing the participants with the opportunity to explore engineering, the Women in Engineering Program (WEP) at UT contributed to increasing the number of female students entering into engineering programs at UT compared to those female students who did not participate in the WE@UT program.},

Based on research proposals, twelve faculty members were chosen from across the campus to teach existing traditional courses as on-line courses and compare on-line results to results from traditional teaching formats. The author's proposal to teach Engineering Economy (EGR 403 Capital Allocation Theory) was accepted. To prepare for teaching on-line, all participants engaged in a summer-long on-line course in collaborative, on-line teaching, a one-week course in Dreamweaver (web page development and management software), and a one-week course in WebCT. Release time was provided to prepare on-line materials. This paper discusses the teaching strategies and learning activities used, testing strategies, communication methods, learning results, and the strengths and weaknesses of WebCT as an on-line web hosting system.},

In early 2002 and with the support of the Georgia Tech's Atlanta and French administrations, the Lycée de la Communication (in Metz, France) and Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology (25 miles from Georgia Tech's Atlanta campus in Conyers, Georgia USA) agreed to an experiment in which French and US students are paired to perform joint research projects. In autumn 2002, ten US students visited France to meet with their French research partners. In April 2003, French students will reciprocate and visit Georgia. Each visiting group resides in local homes and participates in the academic and home life of their host families. The organizers hope to repeat annually and expand with goals including joint and French participation in science and engineering competitions.},

abstract={Engineering degree programs are, by their nature, very structured with extensive prerequisite systems. Because of this, student advising often degrades to the level of updating records and assisting students as they navigate the proper sequence of courses [1 ]. This situation can be substantially changed if both the faculty advisor and the student are provided with a larger view of the entire undergraduate curriculum including major and general education requirements and sequencing. Utilizing database management software and web tools, a system has been implemented that provides both students and faculty advisors with timely and accurate student program data. The information is presented in an easy-to-understand format that is effectively utilized in advising. Providing this information changes the dynamics of an advising session, and allows students and their faculty advisors to focus their conversations on forward planning rather than bookkeeping.},

abstract={Professionals in the Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) industry have noted concerns regarding the appropriateness of the coursework offered at universities across the nation to students seeking an education in HVAC systems. At the core of this concern lies the issue of whether or not an adequate curriculum is being offered on a regular basis to these students at academic institutions since 1986. Very few large Mechanical Engineering Departments currently offer some energy related courses hi their Mechanical Engineering curriculum for those students interested in entering the HVAC profession. However, today's modern building technology encompasses a wide range of disciplines, and integrates the latest engineering technology in design, energy conservation, and energy management. Current computer technology (such as advanced building simulation software, and direct digital control systems) offer the ability to operate facility systems more effectively. Because there is a large demand for college trained professionals in the energy efficiency profession, energy educators must develop an academic program capable of meeting the challenge of equipping students with a repertoire which would allow them to function successfully in the modern building energy industry.},

Students then watched a video on large dams and were assigned to write about the social and economic issues associated with large dams, hi addition they were asked to discuss the social and economic issues of a local project of their choice. After the assignment, class discussion was used to highlight some of the social and economic issues encountered in each project. Student feedback on this learning experience was also obtained.},

abstract={Delivering an innovative graduate program in engineering management to a student body consisting almost entirely of working professionals can be challenging, especially when students are geographically remote from each other and from the main campus. Distance learning methods and technologies can be helpful in bridging this gap and making the program more accessible to a larger group of individuals. However, the implementation of courses and programs via distance learning requires much more than mere translation of traditional class materials and methods into new media, and careful planning is required in order to provide the optimum mix of traditional and non-traditional delivery methods. In addition, although working professional students often appreciate the convenience of an unconventional approach, they and their employers are much more focused and assertive regarding their expectations for the outcomes of courses and degree programs. This paper discusses positive and negative experiences associated with simultaneous delivery of Marshall University's graduate program in engineering management to four different locations, utilizing a combination of interactive video link technology, video-tapes, on-line instruction, and live instruction. The discussion includes an overview of the engineering management area of emphasis in Marshall's Master of Science in Engineering program, course and curriculum development issues, and identification of effective teaching methodologies for employed, adult students in a distance learning environment.},

abstract={All first-year engineering students at Western New England College are required to take a two-credit hour course that deals with computer-aided engineering. This course has two components: computer-aided problem solving and engineering practice. To satisfy the engineering practice portion of the course, all students are expected to present and demonstrate a successful solution to an engineering design problem. The other portion of the course concentrates on developing students' problem-solving skills using engineering computational tools such as MATLAB and MathCAD. In this paper we concentrate on presenting hands-on computer experiments. These are designed to motivate students, enhance problem-solving skills, and introduce students to the latest technology in data acquisition tools as well as data manipulation and processing using MATLAB.},

abstract={With a shift from large, central power plants to smaller generating facilities, small renewable energy systems (SRES) are viable due to the coincidence of several events: 1) deregulation of the electric utility 2) development of BIPV roofing systems, and 3) federal and state tax credits. Roof mounted modules have been tested and used intensively, as seen in the solar roof programs around the world. However, despite the currently available technology, efforts to integrate PV systems into roof system have been minimal. Previous research shows that multifamily housing complexes are ideal candidates as small power producers (SPP) due to their 1) flexible roof configurations, 2) high percentage of roof area and 3) rent base management structure. Projected to provide up to 70% of a building's electric demand, integrated PV fenestration can offset the overall utility costs and produce energy that can be sold to the building's tenants. This paper presents findings from student centered research of a prototypical study of multi-family housing utility subsidiary that sells renewable electric energy produced by integrated photovoltaic roof systems to the tenants. The results show significant economic benefits while increasing the building's energy conservation.},

abstract={The World Wide Web is ubiquitous, interesting, and is now a part of many electrical and computer engineering courses. A set of Web design modules for utilization in non-web programming electrical and computer engineering undergraduate classes is introduced in this paper. The modules began as an introductory exercise for a "Circuits for the non-major" class, and have been adapted for utilization for a number of different audiences. The introductory module for the Circuits class takes about 15 minutes on the first day of class, and proves to be a popular introduction for the non-major [mechanical engineering students and civil engineering students] to the topic of 'electrical and computer engineering'. The students have laptops in class, and are instructed to develop a small webpage to describe themselves to the entire class. The WebPages are posted on the course Blackboard, which is course management software, during the first session and the instructor displays the pages as a different way for students to introduce themselves on the first day of class. This type of interactivity is utilized in engineering design in industry, and students find the environment stimulating. Web page design is approached in the format of mechanical engineering design, and reinforces the step-by-step design concepts that are essential for the modern engineer. Lastly, the student utilizes and reinforces 'technical communication' skills that are a part of a required humanities course. An additional benefit is that it takes less than a half an hour for one module.},

abstract={Engineering and technology schools, departments and students are encouraged to explore a capstone design project option that possesses significant, far-reaching implications for international humanitarian application. An Indianapolis, Indiana-based non-profit organization called the "Institute of Affordable Transportation (IAT)" engages young engineering and technology talent through service-based capstone projects to design and develop a class of transportation known as a Basic Utility Vehicle (BUY). The IAT's mission is to improve living standards and enable economic growth in the Third World by creating a simple vehicte that can be assembled almost anywhere, by almost anyone. To propagate this initiative, the IAT hosts an annual collegiate BUY competition that tests student-designed prototype BUV's. Ultimately, the student efforts from these competitions will help provide mobility, freedom and economic hope to people in rural areas of devebping countries. This paper introduces the organization that is the genesis of this initiative, gives an overview of the first two IAT collegiate competitions (including examples of student-designed and other vehicles), reflects on the academic benefits to participating students and faculty and culminates with an invitation to academic institutions to become involved in this life-changing initiative.},

abstract={This paper presents the details of an undergraduate senior design project in our design technology course 1-3. The main idea of this design is to have a keypad that could be carried on board an ambulance to communicate with the units available on houses in neighborhoods so that in an emergency situation ambulances can easily identify where the emergency call is coming from. As the ambulance is approaching the neighborhood where the emergency is taking place, the attendant could push a code that is unique to the house where assistance is needed, which would activate a beacon located in front of the house. This would greatly limit the time spent on finding the house which is ordinarily spent on trying to read numbers that are not always where they are suppose to be. In this design, each of the houses has its own unique three-digit code that can easily be changed. The data lines are the only portion of the system that is shared between the ambulance and the houses.},

abstract={Improving the quality of instruction is a key strategic goal of the College of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. The Faculty Innovation Center (FIC) plays a crucial role in realizing that goal. Many colleges of engineering provide teaching effectiveness support, and some provide instructional technology services, but the linkage of these two services is not always found in a single organization. The FIC offers a distinctive combination of technical and instructional expertise. As such, the FIC is ideally positioned to support faculty in adapting to the increasingly technology-driven teaching environment and to assist the College as it makes strides in instructional innovation. In this paper, we will explore the spectrum of FIC enterprises. Engineering faculty come to the FIC for a range of services, from technology assistance to pedagogical exploration. Sometimes, faculty members need help evaluating the appropriate use of instructional technology. They may also need ongoing training and support for integrating technologies into their teaching. The FIC works with faculty to create a video presentation or a media-rich Web site. Whether putting an entire course online or simply enhancing the classroom experience, working with the FIC requires minimal technical expertise on the part of the faculty member. The FIC inspires instructional innovation and excellence. By providing technical and instructional expertise, the FIC allows faculty to stay focused on their area of expertise -engineering.},

One method, PID control, normally requires a tuning process after the system is installed. This paper describes how a kiln with manual temperature control was modified to automate the process by utilizing a microprocessor-based PID controller. The controller accepts input from a "K" type thermocouple to switch the heater on and off with a solid state relay. The process variable is transmitted through a data acquisition system to a PC for storage and further analysis. This project provides valuable hands-on experience in control loop tuning and produces reasonably accurate results. The paper shows the design schematic and presents results.},

abstract={This paper describes the results of a novel approach in a senior mechanical engineering lab course, which combined team reporting, self-assessment of writing, conference grading, and consultative techniques that help learners improve both their communicative competence and their performance. We argue that the approach increases communications assignments and makes them more effective as teaching tools, without increasing the professor's workload. Moreover, the approach is similar to industry practices of reviewing communications face-to-face and evaluating them in the context of assigned project objectives, and therefore better prepares students for the demands of the workplace. In addition to the instructor's assessment, the reactions of the students were obtained by oral surveys. The results indicated that the students believed the approach to increase their understanding of assignments, their attention to and understanding of the instructor's comments, and their motivation. Finally, initial assessment of student writing indicated improvement resulting from the innovation.},

abstract={Students working toward the Baccalaureate degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) at the University op Cincinnati are required to complete a Design, Build & Test Capstone design project. Some of these projects are geared to meet the needs of the local non-profit organizations that provide community service. For the past several years, the MET department has been working with these organizations to identify problems to be solved by senior students. The current focus is on improving the quality of life for the elderly and people with physical disabilities. Doctors and nurses examining wheelchair bound patients state that in order to minimize the risk and discomfort to the patients as well as the risk to the healthcare professionals, a better method to shift these patients from the wheelchair to an examination table should be devised. This paper describes a project solving this problem from concept to final working prototype. The practical solution was a bi-use wheelchair, which can function as a wheelchair, then will convert to an examination table that rises to the proper height.},

abstract={The Colleges of Engineering and Science at the University of Texas at El Paso have developed a multi-faceted system based on peer support to address the particular needs of science and engineering majors. At the core of this strategy is a strong commitment to develop the critical thinking and leadership skills of a selected cohort of undergraduate students. These students act as peer mentors, tutors, team leaders, and role models for the undergraduate science and engineering student population. A synergistic effort is achieved by bringing together the resources of the Academic Center for Engineers and Scientists (ACES), the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, and the Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES). Through the use of existing facilities and services available at ACES, a wide network of mentoring, coaching, and tutoring has become the principal support system for a large student commuter population. In this article we will discuss the development of this successful peer support system, the synergy generated by the ACES, REU, and CircLES staff, and the outcome of the effort.},

abstract={The authors developed a series of computer aided drawing instructional modules utilizing MicroStation® software as part of the Software Series in Civil Engineering Technology Independent Learning Experiment at Fairmont State College - Track 3: Design. These modules, which are customized to utilize transportation and transportation structures projects, serve as enhancements to the Design Track in the CET program, specifically enhancing instructional objectives in Structures (CIV 290), Structural Design (CIV 440), Advanced Structural Analysis (CIV 410), Surveying II (CIV 240), and Highway Design (CIV 400). Using transportation projects throughout the scheduling modules provides an experience integrating aspects of the transportation, structural, and water system tracks within the program. The series is comprised of Three modules: Module 1, Introduction to MicroStation®; Module 2, MicroStation® Applications for Bridge Design; Module 3, MicroStation® Applications for Highway Design; In each module, students are required to complete exercises based on example projects created by the authors. The examples utilized in the modules are actual transportation projects, which have been constructed and are in use. The utilization of built projects allows the students to gain additional experience with proven construction plans followed by visits to the actual sites to see the constructed product illustrated in the plans. Final projects are employed to bring together learning activities from each of the modules. This summative final project approach serves to reinforce the "real world" experience.},

abstract={This presentation is part of an ongoing research project by the authors looking at how constraint-based 3D modeling can be used as a vehicle for rethinking instructional approaches to engineering design graphics. A particular goal is moving from a mode of instruction based on the crafting by students and assessment by instructors of static 2D drawings and 3D models. Instead, an approach based on dynamic modeling is proposed. This approach provides the opportunities for students to learn about geometry through the embedding of geometric behaviors into models and then testing these behaviors via dynamic change of the model. An advantage to dynamic modeling is the ability to provide visual embodiment to the underlying logic of the constraint strategy, providing direct feedback to the student and a straightforward mechanism for assessment by the instructor. Also, this approach mimics the real-world activities of engineers and designers executing 'change orders' on their virtual product models. As such, this approach is better aligned with larger goals of better problem-solving abilities in the technology and engineering workforce. A previously developed taxonomy of geometric behaviors is used to guide the development of activities that provide an appropriate range of activities for the students. Example instructional activities will be presented.},

abstract={The advanced design and manufacturing/ assembly industry is increasingly operating on a globally integrated, Internet-based collaborative model of design, production and support in which OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) assemble products out of components and objects (both hardware and software) by a network of distributed suppliers. This distributed client-server digital enterprise collaboration and creation model is enabled by the Internet, company intranets and consortium based extranets. In order to fulfill this need, we have created an object / component-oriented methodology and architecture, that is analytical, quantitative, and open-source computational This paper introduces the methodology, to some extent the object/ component knowledge documentation architecture and offers examples of this industry /academia sponsored R&D effort. As our validation results, and the over thirty supporting enterprises clearly indicate, our 3D web-enabled, interactive multimedia solution can be applied to satisfy a large variety of engineering technology knowledge documentation and learning, as well as hi-tech product and process marketing needs. For education, the created CBL Library is an effective method for outcome-oriented problem solving and assessment because it forces both the student as well as the tutor to focus, and then create new wealth, and encourage outcome-oriented educational practices and follow US ABET (Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology in the USA), and European educational principles.},

abstract={Many program look for ways to simulate "real" design experiences. At Purdue University, the EPICS - Engineering Projects in Community Service - program does this through long-term team projects that solve technology-based problems for local community service organizations. The program currently has 24 project teams with approximately 450 students participating during the 2002 academic year. Each EPICS project team consists often to 20 students, a local community service organization that functions as its customer and a faculty and/or industrial adviser. The teams are multidisciplinary; they are composed of students from 20 majors across engineering and the university. The teams are vertically-integrated; each is a mix of freshman, sophomores, juniors and seniors. A key concern with any real design experience, where the purpose is to expose students to open ended problems and multiple solution paths and to encourage creativity, is the evaluation of student performance. This is especially difficult with multidisciplinary and vertically integrated experiences. This process can be further confounded when the projects are driven by an external customer, making it difficult to predetermine the expected outcomes. The EPICS program has developed a series of methods to help assess student achievement and assign grades in an equitable manner. They cover a variety of attributes that each student brings to the team based on his or her discipline and academic year. These methods include automated weekly report and peer evaluation systems, design notebooks, self assessments, and an evaluation matrix. They are used in a dry run grading period near the middle of the semester to help calibrate students in their performance. This paper will provide an overview of these methods and how they have been applied in the context of the EPICS program.},

The structure for the course is described, followed by a description of student feedback on their learning experiences. Students have enjoyed working on these projects, although it is important to retain the option to select a more traditional project. Based on the required curriculum content for engineers per the ABET 2000 criteria, the students working on sustainable projects in developing countries report that a wider range of non-technical issues of importance to design are emphasized.},

abstract={K-12 engineering outreach programs are gaining in popularity as vehicles for getting students interested in engineering at an early age. This paper presents such a program that is integrated with the undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum at Lehigh University. Annually, approximately eighty mechanical engineering juniors complete a three-credit course entitled ME 240-Manufacturing. This course exposes them to a wide array of manufacturing processes from a scientific, business and social standpoint. The course is innovative in that manufacturing science knowledge is acquired while students simultaneously develop skills in the areas of teamwork, project management, business analysis, and customer focused product realization. An additional innovation is the creative inclusion of approximately 120 local middle school students. These students benefit by developing an awareness of engineering as a potential future career at a critical age. The cooperative university/middle school learning environment has been found to be one that the students enjoy and the ME 240 experience has become a favorite of the Lehigh and middle school students alike.},

abstract={A three-phased project is underway in the School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh that is aimed at integrating engineering economic analysis across the curriculum. In the first phase, an engineering economic analysis needs assessment was done. During the second phase of the project, the course content for the engineering economic analysis courses is being modified based on the needs assessment. The third phase will integrate the material into other courses in each of the school's engineering disciplines by developing and making available (via the web) an Engineering Economic Analysis Template. In this paper, we will report on the current results of this project and propose that a similar project can be extended to other engineering schools across the country.},

abstract={The ability to communicate effectively is expected of all college graduates. The ability to present technical concepts and write good reports distinguishes an outstanding technologist from an average one. Feedback from our industrial board indicated that writing should form an integral part of an electrical engineering technologist's education. The goal of graduating electrical engineering technologists with effective communication skills is found in the ABET 2000 TAC criteria. Traditionally, electrical engineering technology programs have required that courses in technical writing and oral presentations be administered through their English departments. While these courses can provide useful instruction, they inevitably suffer from certain drawbacks. First, these courses teach students only one standardized approach to writing and speaking, overlooking the significant differences that exist in the way that engineers in various industrial domains communicate technical information. And second, the courses seldom provide the students with adequate, "real world" exercises. To help give our freshman students a better understanding of technical writing and to give the electrical engineering technology program immediate relevance, ECET 196 "Introduction to ECET and Projects" has been designed to incorporate the teaching of these communication skills. This paper focuses specifically on my efforts to incorporate these features into this course and into our undergraduate laboratory courses.},

Using the same model, in fell 2002, the Introduction to Engineering course that is required of all freshmen offered a design project that included service learning as an option. The "Outreach Project" required students, in teams of four, to propose and design a project that they could take to a K-8 classroom that would teach about engineering, math or science. The projects were required to align with the NC Standard Course of Study and national science and technology standards. Projects could be interactive or passive (e.g. a hallway display) and were required to meet strict acceptability guidelines before the teams were matched with a particular K-12 classroom. This paper describes the lessons learned as fifteen teams participated in this pilot project.},

abstract={The technological requirements of the 21 st century will often be satisfied through the concept of multi-disciplinary research. Multi-disciplinary research is often the impetus that moves science, engineering and technology forward to facilitate system solutions. A common approach to establishing and sustaining multi-disciplinary research at small and minority universities is through a Multi-disciplinary Research Center (MDRC). The general mission of the MDRC is to: Conduct research in the sciences; Develop technologies and evaluation procedures; Resolve technical and human problems; or Assess the impact of various conditions on life, materials, systems or the environment. Centers also provide various research bases, which are carried through engineering implementation. The first step of establishing a MDRC is to identify a "funding source" with needs in the various areas of local expertise. The second step is to propose a center foundation or organization upon which to build the MDRC infrastructure. Constructing the foundation of an organization, which will convince the funding source of likely success is very important. As with forming any organization, one must consider the political, functional and operational environments concerning the mission, goals and objectives. The leadership traits of the center director must be well communicated throughout the Office of the Director, fostering participatory management and accountability. The strategies used to establish and sustain the NASA-Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU) Center for Applied Radiation Research (CARR), an $11.5M, five-year endeavor are provided.},

This development has taken various forms including directed production of lab modules, production of supplemental material, and researching an in-depth'subject then teaching it to peers. The curriculum development experiences are shown from three perspectives; first from the perspective of the faculty member advising the development, second from the perspective of the student developing the material, and third from the perspective of students using the material for learning. The actual curriculum developed from these experiences contributes well to the learning environments but the major learning is taking place by the students doing the development. It is well known that teaching is one of the most powerful learning mechanisms. Mentoring environments facilitate the learner as a teacher. Future work of using undergraduate students to develop curriculum suggest a move towards a faculty and peer mentoring environment.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to compare the curriculums and the methodology of teaching of the Civil Engineering (CE) departments of the University of Florida (UF) and the University of Engineering & Technology, Lahore (UET). An overview of the CE courses at both institutions has been presented and reviewed. Each school is among the national leaders in engineering education. The civil engineering department at UET Lahore is one of the oldest departments at the university, and the first in Pakistan. It is not a semester-based system and follows an annual system of education. The University of Florida is among the oldest universities of the United States, and follows a semester system. Despite the different systems of education in the two institutions, both are providing exceptional education in producing top quality engineers. The CE education at UF is focused on providing a broad general education that enhances communication skills, teamwork, and leadership skills. The CE education at UET Lahore empasizes on the fundamental concepts and principles, which constitutes the basis of civil engineering practice. To foster their creative abilities, the students are assigned projects on design or laboratory investigations for self-directed execution. The classroom and laboratory work is supplemented with field trips to acquaint students with the civil engineering projects of national importance. The difference in offering courses within the curriculum at both institutions is based on the regional needs of each country. However, the general aim at both institutions is to provide a well-rounded, excellent CE education.},

abstract={During the past decade, and especially over the last few years, engineering educators have been promoting, and implementing in their classrooms, an increased emphasis on student creativity, problem-solving ability, and inventiveness. At a growing number of universities, student engineers are studying the creative process, developing advanced thinking and problem-solving skills, and learning to design by experience. Successful programs, projects, and research at premier engineering schools around the country are equipping students with the advanced creative and cognitive abilities required to succeed as contemporary professionals. This paper is a review of the innovative, multi-disciplinary, educational methodology that is manifest in several types of new efforts, including: 1) Engineering design in a studio atmosphere; 2) Engineering courses for creative problem-solving; 3) Encouraging creativity and insight through journal writing; 4) The agenda for creativity at the UK Centre for Materials Education; and 5) A focus on the personal creative process. Research for this review inspired The Creativity, Innovation, and Design Report, a new national publication dedicated to fostering creativity and innovation in engineering and applied science education.},

abstract={The Concentrations in Environmental Sustainability (ConsEnSus) Program at the University of Michigan is a new multi-disciplinary opportunity for graduate students in the College of Engineering to pursue interests in environmental sustainability white obtaining a traditional engineering Master's degree. Students from several engineering departments complement traditional disciplinary course requirements with courses in environmental regulations, policies, and technology. A required case studies course of the ConsEnSus Program brings practicing engineers together with students to discuss real-world sustainability problems. The industrial participants interactively present relevant case studies, and provide opportunities for experiential learning through classroom activities and term projects. This paper will further explain the ConsEnSus Program, its implementation, the initial successes of the program, and the case studies course and term project that was developed in collaboration with industry.},

abstract={The Aviation Technology (AT) Department of Purdue University is now entering the third year of an ongoing globalization effort. Activities have included visits to numerous aviation programs around the world for the purpose of setting up aviation specific Study Abroad opportunities. The department offered an aviation law course in Oxford, England for Aviation Technology students in 2002. The Aviation Management major is now requiring a globalization component, with the other majors soon to follow. The first faculty-led global study trip for academic credit offered by Aviation Technology is currently under development. The trip will be nine days in length and will be offered during spring break 2003. Interest is high with 25 - 30 students expected to participate. The trip will visit aviation operations, manufacturers, museums, and places of cultural interest in England and France. Development to date has included considerable research and a trip by participating faculty in October 2002. The trip visited all potential sites, investigated transportation issues, and evaluated the overall environment for student participation. Two new courses were developed to support this type of travel. The first is a one-hour seminar course taught by the faculty trip leaders to prepare students and have them perform research prior to travel. The second is a two-hour course for the actual trip and associated assignments, logs, and trip reports. All three majors in Aviation Technology have agreed to accept this type of credit towards graduation requirements. This paper will discuss the development of this type of academic experience, the associated course content, and the desired outcomes.},

abstract={While most graduating engineers have solid training in applying engineering principles to analysis, product design, testing and other technical duties, they are frequently not prepared to understand the nature and goals of the companies and ventures that employ them. Many studies have noted the disconnect in engineering curriculum between the assessment of customer needs as dictated by the marketplace and the engineering of products. In product design and development engineers are often quick to offer solutions without fully exploring the actual need and market for those solutions. Approaching a problem with this kind of "solution fixation" can limit an engineer's contributions in business environments. What business skills do engineers need to acquire and how does the engineering mindset influence an engineer's business savvy? Using funding from the Ford Motor Company; faculty from The University of Texas at Austin (UT) in the mechanical engineering department and graduate studies program and staff from the Faculty Innovation Center (FIC) are exploring answers to these questions by creating a curriculum for a short course on business skills for engineers. This paper provides a look at the pilot short course's curriculum, strategies, and resources used to present and teach interdisciplinary concepts related to engineering and business. The following three components were used in the instructional process: teaching notes; a course-package; and interactive multimedia resources. Fundamental to this short course is the notion that business is about relationships and communication. Through exercises, students are encouraged to develop their questioning and listening skills to guide them in a range of business interactions. This short course endeavor complements a larger project within the mechanical engineering department focused on implementing project-based learning into the curriculum.},

abstract={Over the last three years, nearly a quarter of Bucknell's engineering faculty have participated in Project Catalyst, a NSF funded project to promote systemic change in engineering education by integrating instructional design techniques, transforming the classroom into a cooperative learning environment, and incorporating the use of information technology in the teaching/learning process. One of the major outcomes of that work is a conceptual framework for assisting faculty in transitioning from more traditional instructional modes to more collaborative modes of instruction. Drawing heavily on a typical engineering process, this framework maps concepts readily understood in the engineering design world to the development of instructional experiences. This paper outlines that framework and discusses our efforts to export this framework to faculty beyond Bucknell through a pair of national workshops conducted last summer. Included is our assessment of the effectiveness of this effort, both in terms of impact on Bucknell faculty and on the workshop participants.},

abstract={At small scales, mechanics enters a new regime where the role of surfaces, interfaces, defects, material property variations, and quantum effects play more dominant roles. A new course in nanoscale mechanics for engineering students was recently taught at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. This course provided an introduction to nanoscale engineering with a direct focus on the critical role that mechanics needs to play in this developing area. The limits of continuum mechanics were presented as well as newly developed mechanics theories and experiments tailored to study and describe micro- and nano-scale phenomena. Numerous demonstrations and experiments were used throughout the course, including synthesis and fabrication techniques for creating nanostructured materials, bubble raft models to demonstrate size scale effects in thin film structures, and a laboratory project to construct a nanofilter device. A primary focus of this paper is the laboratory content of this course, which includes an integrated series of laboratory modules utilizing atomic force microscopy, self-assembled monolayer deposition, and microfluidic technology.},

abstract={Techtronics: Hands-On Exploration in Everyday Life, is an after school program in engineering education designed for middle school students. A joint venture between the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University and Rogers-Herr Middle School in Durham, North Carolina, and funded by a three year grant from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Techtronics seeks to stimulate intellectual curiosity in engineering through exposure to four engineering disciplines: civil, mechanical, electrical and computer, and biomedical engineering. For each unit, students typically work in groups of three to five to complete a project under the guidance of one of five undergraduate Pratt Engineering student teachers. A graduate student coordinates each team of undergraduate teaching fellows. In Techtronics I, students build balsa wood bridges, programmable robots, heart monitors, and solar powered devices. In Techtronics II, returning and new students are participating in an entirely new curriculum during the 2002-2003 academic year. Techtronics II is comprised of approximately half returning students and half new students. Though some students have been lost, the 50% return rate of students from last year's program suggests that the program is meeting its goals to provide a stimulating creative outlet for students with interest in science and engineering. In Techtronics II, returning and new students use computer-aided design (CAD) to test their civil engineering designs before building them in groups, compete in a group setting on the Lego Robotics Mars Rover project, and build AM radio kits. This paper provides an overview of the new structure of the Techtronics program and details the new hands-on, group-oriented modules used in Techtronics II.},

abstract={This paper presents a successful senior project of instrumentation developed in a Mechanical Engineering Technology senior capstone course. Students were encouraged to approach the problem of designing an air-filter sensor and to propose an optimum and practical solution for the problem. Work includes conceptual design and analysis, implementation, tests and modifications. When an air filter is used in a home air conditioner, inhabitants often forget when to replace it until the cooling or heating capacity is obviously reduced. If the filter remains in service, the efficiency of the cooling/heating system will continue decreasing while the electricity bill will significantly increase. In some worst cases, the air quality will also be affected. This paper presents an idea of designing and fabricating an air-filter sensor to alleviate this problem. The sensor will send a warning signal when the filter collects a specific amount of dust in the air filter. It can be easily installed and only consumes a negligible amount of electricity. A photo sensor with an infrared LED emitter and receiver is used in this design. As the infrared LED can transmit through most of the home-used air filter to its receiver, a signal will be sent out when a specified amount of dust is collected in the filter and the light is blocked from the emitter to the receiver. The emitter and receiver are mounted on a simple fixture and can be easily fitted on an air filter. In addition, cost analysis of using the sensor show that it can save a significant amount on an electricity bill, when filters are replaced properly.},

abstract={Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technology. The use of cell phones and mp3 players permeates every age group and socio-economic stratum. The creation of new devices that improve human life quality is the essence of engineering. Yet, the vast majority of the population does not even know what engineering is. In a 1998 Poll 61% of adults claimed that they were "not well informed" about engineering. This statistic is the result of the fact that engineering is generally not introduced in either elementary or secondary education. Exposing elementary and middle school students to engineering concepts will increase awareness of the general population and potentially lead to more children pursuing careers in engineering fields. This project introduces students at Rogers-Herr Middle School in Durham, North Carolina, to mechanical engineering fundamentals throughout the course of a school year. Our goal is to create an integrated curriculum accompanied by hands-on projects and weekly quizzes. Teaching is structured with weekly lectures accompanied by several interactive demonstrations and experiments. Students are given weekly hands-on projects that are evaluated and assessed based on their incorporation of the concepts presented in lecture. In addition, students are given short, individual, weekly quizzes that contain problems that rely on a conceptual understanding of the material presented during the previous week. The topics covered are: heat transfer, fluid dynamics and velocity/acceleration. Projects include mousetrap cars, catapults and Rube-Goldberg machines. This paper presents a detailed description of the program curriculum, the assessment instruments and conclusions regarding program effectiveness.},

abstract={Active and cooperative learning methods recognize that the passive model of the typical college lecture does not work for many students. Instead, active and cooperative learning focuses on the premise that the students can learn best by doing and working with each other. Traditionally structured class periods imply that students listen to a professor lecture for about an hour. Cooperative learning can replace some of that lecture time with methods designed to get students actively involved during the class period. This paper presents the use of active and cooperative learning techniques applied to a first-year, first semester of principles of industrial engineering course. In this course, students are introduced to engineering problem solving, engineering design, and industrial engineering topic areas. In addition, this course provides introductory skills in computer technology and provides an opportunity for first-year students to get acclimated to the university within a supportive environment. Tips and examples for how to transform a standard lecture into a lecture based on cooperative exercises are given and the authors' experiences with these techniques are detailed. Examples include introductory coverage of quality control, engineering economics, material handling, manufacturing systems, and methods analysis. In addition, potential projects for the course will be discussed.},

Studies have shown that faculty industrial placement is a component of life-long learning that helps to maintain and expand technological skills 1. The internship program at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), fully supported by the industrial advisory council, is set up to be a very simple and paper-free process. Every semester one member of the faculty spends the entire semester working as an engineer at a local industry and continues to draw his or her normal salary from the university. The industry, in turn, reimburses the university for the cost of replacing the faculty with adjunct faculty. Since the faculty member is employed as a contractor in the host company, he/she retains the employment benefits from the university. This paper describes the logistical details of faculty industrial internships, advantages to the industry and the university, and the personal experiences of the author as a faculty intern.},

abstract={The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has revised the accreditation criteria that is designed to assure that graduates of accredited programs are prepared to enter the practice of engineering and satisfy industrial requirements. The general criteria also specifies that engineering programs must demonstrate that their graduates possess or satisfy eleven (11) educational attributes or outcomes generally known as "a" through "k". This investigation suggests that both industrial practitioners and undergraduate Civil (Construction) Engineering students consider two of the eleven (11) outcomes to be particularly important. In addition, graduating seniors in Civil (Construction) engineering believe their coursework has given them a strong background in the identical two areas. These include: (1) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering; and (2) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems. In contrast, three outcomes received slightly lower ratings from each of the groups. These include, a knowledge of contemporary issues; the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global/societal context; and an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs. Overall, the data may suggest that not all ABET educational attributes are considered by graduating seniors in Civil (Construction) engineering, industrial practitioners, and undergraduates to have the same level of significance and perhaps should not be stressed to the same degree in an engineering program. For comparative purposes, the findings of the investigation could be utilized by other institutions and departments that may wish to study and/or assess their curriculum and satisfy ABET criteria.},

abstract={The energy conversion course is traditionally included in the requirements for an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering. The course typically covers topics in transformers and classical rotating machinery. As the competition becomes more intense for the limited undergraduate credit-hours this practice has been on the decline. As a result, there is a growing population of electrical engineers in practice with a very limited knowledge of the theory and application of energy conversion devices. This paper highlights a required undergraduate course on energy systems and conversion for electrical engineering (EE) students at Penn State University -Harrisburg. The new course format adds components that are not typically included in the students' exposure to the subject. It guides students to explore various energy sources, conversion technologies, and highlights economic, environmental, sustainability, ethical, health and safety, social, and political issues in energy use.},

This includes classes with joint classroom and lab meetings, sharing of laboratories, and partnering of students for senior design classes and design-build-test projects. This initiative for this partnership is multifold. It is driving by industry pressure for engineering students to increase their application skills. Furthermore, tight budgets and a significant change in university culture provide significant reward opportunities for participating departments and faculty. The advantages of collaboration are numerous. Engineering students are able to learn about manufacturing, service, and repair issues that enhance their ability to truly design for manufacturing. Technology students are able to better understand design constraints and create improved manufacturing and repair techniques. The sharing of facilities allows each group to build on its strengths and not waste resources on materials or equipment that are redundant. These activities were started by the initiative of interested faculty. A more formalized structure is emerging with the offering of five new minors from Aeronautical Technology in materials and propulsion combined with a joint plan of study for a dual major under development.},

Senior project courses in computer science/engineering are usually designed to be one or two semester-long and they traditionally involve large-scale software systems development. There is also a tendency to assign hardware/software integration projects to prepare students for the competitive job market. This paper introduces an innovative approach to enable students to work in multi-disciplinary teams and develop large-scale software/hardware systems.

abstract={The Roy Report serves as the basis for today's typical industrial engineering curriculum. That report documents a 1966-1967 study led by Robert Roy, Dean of Engineering Science at Johns Hopkins University, supported by NSF and sponsored by ASEE. Unfortunately, few major changes have been made to the core baccalaureate-level industrial engineering curriculum shared by most American universities since the dissemination of the Roy Report and initial implementations based on its findings. This paper describes the work of a project team from the Department of Industrial Engineering at Clemson University, sponsored by NSF. The team has been working since September 2002 to develop a new scalable and deployable industrial engineering baccalaureate-degree model. This model is designed to permit scaling up from an information technology kernel of coursework to a fully integrated industrial engineering undergraduate curriculum. Three aspects of the new curriculum plan are described in this paper.},

abstract={Capstone design courses are prominent elements of engineering degree programs and are central to the development and assessment of student professional competencies for program accreditation. This paper describes a process for establishing broadly-applicable capstone design course learning outcomes and proposes a set that may become universally applicable across programs and disciplines. These capstone course outcome definitions will guide faculty in creation of improved instructional materials and methods for facilitating engineering-practice-oriented student learning. They also provide a foundation upon which broadly-applicable assessments of student learning can be developed to address the nationwide challenge for capstone course instructors to assess student achievement of important program outcomes. Capstone course learning outcomes were derived from the attributes of top quality engineers, both upon graduation and five years after graduation, as defined by a team of faculty and industry engineers collaborating across disciplines and organizations. The attributes of top quality engineers include: (1) motivation, (2) technical competence, (3) judgment and decision making, (4) innovation, (5) client/quality focus, (6) business orientation, (7) product development, (8) professional/ethical, (9) teamwork, (10) change management, and (11) communication. These attributes span ABET engineering criteria 3 and 4 requirements. A set of broadly-applicable capstone course learning outcomes is presented to address needs for developing the attributes of top quality engineers and to match capstone course objectives within engineering curricula.},

abstract={The objectives of this project are to demonstrate that (a) it is practical and feasible to offer engineering undergraduate students a course on Web-based Instrumentation and Control (WIC) that involves recent technological innovations; (b) the proposed course can be effectively conducted with two integrated components: classroom lecturing and hands-on practice through a remote setting; and (c) the course materials can also be offered after modification to gifted high school students and, thus, be used as a vehicle to attract students to engineering disciplines. Since July 1, 2002 (the official starting date of the project), we have been actively involved in developing the WIC Laboratory. After the laboratory is set up, it will have 10 workstations that are inter-connected via campus LAN. Each workstation will consist of a PC, a data acquisition board, and other instruments. A web server and a process server will run on every workstation. A number of web cameras will be installed in the lab. Students will be able to conduct WIC experiments, and Internet users will be able to navigate to the lab site to witness the progress of the laboratory development. We plan to offer an undergraduate course on WIC in the coming summer semester.},

This new Academic Model is based on learning outcomes as well as on grade point average. University and College specific learning outcomes form the basis of the Information Systems Curriculum. These outcomes are derived from the college's vision of the knowledge and skills that students need to acquire in order to be successful in gaining employment. Special courses are used to support and assist students in their understanding of the learning outcomes. Furthermore, we show how the use of technology can facilitate the learning and assessment process. Students develop an electronic portfolio to document and reflect on their learning experiences. Assessment and feedback are used to make the learning outcomes component work effectively in the students' learning experiences. This new academic model may help address issues on curricular design for successful career placement, and producing graduates with the skills and abilities needed for the job market.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates how networked laptop computers (and/or personal computers) may be used with course management software to accomplish the following four goals while enhancing student learning: Simplify the process of communicating course information to students. Assess student performance without using paper, pens, and pencils. Keep students apprised of their grades without intruding on class time and faculty office time. Systematically and efficiently accumulate evidence of student performance. Students and faculty, alike, benefit from more productive uses of their time and are increasingly computer literate. Computers have capabilities that can enhance the teaching and learning process in many ways, and, they can free users of many necessary but often more mundane and less satisfying aspects of student and faculty work. So, by marrying human capabilities, needs, and desires with computer technology, students and faculty can accomplish more with less, i.e., more effective and satisfying student learning and faculty teaching with less student and faculty time and effort expended. Alternatively, even more student learning and faculty teaching is possible with the same time and effort expended. This paper is a case history of the use of networked laptop computers, personal computers, and course information software spanning a two-year period of progressively advancing computer and software applications. Its focus is primarily on quiz and exam administration and keeping students apprised of their performance.},

abstract={The assessment of entrepreneurship and innovation projects and coursework is relatively new in engineering education. At the past two National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) annual meetings, roundtables focusing on assessment provided participants with the opportunity to share their concerns with regards to assessment of E-teams and related programs. As a result of these roundtables, the University of Pittsburgh is developing a database containing information from the various projects sponsored by the NCIIA. We are specifically focusing on the assessment of entrepreneur-based projects and programs by participating NCIIA members. The database will allow NCIIA participants to: access web-based instruments, obtain guidance on how to conduct an assessment, and learn about assessment/evaluation practices in academic entrepreneurship programs. As an initial effort, current and past NCIIA participants were surveyed to determine the variety of assessments they have conducted on E-teams as well as any long-term impact that the "E-team experience" has had on students. Concomitantly, a database of assessment instruments and methodologies provided by the participants as well as those identified through other sources is being maintained. This paper describes the results of the survey and how the resulting database can be used in the evaluation of entrepreneur-based projects.},

abstract={Technological innovations influenced by the capabilities of global communication means are creating competitive environments that require companies to respond faster to customer needs with higher quality products. To foster competitiveness, global companies in the twenty-first century are being challenged to integrate all their resources into a seamless digital enterprise. This seamless integration represents a technological environment that leverages the skills and knowledge of all participants to include customers, suppliers, manufacturers, vendors, retailers, engineers, customer support, sales, and designers. The integration of design processes within digital enterprises is realized through the application of web-centric product-data management systems. These systems allow for the exchange of design data and product configuration in a manner that facilitates not only interdepartmental communication but also inter-enterprise collaboration. Within existing technologies, these systems can help to facilitate design processes, shorten time-to-market, and increase product design quality. This paper describes efforts with the Department of Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue University to integrate product data management applications and product lifecycle management philosophies within its computer-aided design curriculum. Topics covered include course information within the computer-aided design curriculum, technologies utilized, a group design project that implements components of product lifecycle management, future developments, and student feedback.},

abstract={Product Line and Product Family approaches are development techniques that take advantage of commonalities that exist among a set of current or planned products. The use of a product line approach allows for speedier integration of new requirements and capabilities to account for product variation without the timely process of reorganizing and reengineering an entire product. While the product line approach is an emerging paradigm in the software development research and industrial communities, little attention has been placed on its use as a methodology for developing and maintaining course projects in an engineering curriculum. As part of an Embedded Systems concentration at Arizona State University we are creating a course in Embedded Systems Engineering that focuses on systems integration and applications development. For this course we are developing a home automation product line. By using a product line approach, students can gain exposure to new technologies in successive offerings while still receiving instruction on core concepts. Furthermore, instructors can easily provide a wide variety of experiences for students with a minimal amount of incremental course refinements.},

abstract={This paper describes a collaborative project involving students, faculty, community members, and The Institute for Women and Technology. The Virtual Development Center (VDC) site at Santa Clara University is one of nine such sites at universities around the country, each committed to including the community in the definition of projects that truly benefit a segment of the population usually ignored in the design and development of new technology. We begin with workshops that bring together women with a variety of life experiences (teenagers to octogenarians, technophile to technophobe), providing a forum for women in local communities to make their views on technological developments known to major research and development organizations; to generate new and unique ideas for technological changes and developments that would be of benefit to women and families; and to discuss their needs and increase their skills in expressing their views on technology. In our third year we initiated a relationship with HomeSafe, a transitional housing community for survivors of domestic violence. We found that in addition to showing the students the benefits of serving the community, and of having to design for a specific real world user population, we were able to attract many of our women students to the project. The women students found the experience validated their feeling that engineering should have a positive impact in "the real world." This paper will describe the experience of the students and the projects they produced for the women at HomeSafe.},

abstract={Faculty development efforts in the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI have been greatly aided by Responsibility Center Management (RCM). Under RCM, academic units generate revenue streams through credit hour tuition; state appropriation; indirect cost recovery from grants and contract; and/or development and fundraising efforts. University-level administrators charge academic units a tax for central services, and, in practice, academic units whose revenue (less costs) exceeds their tax end up with a surplus that can be used for personnel, programmatic, and other initiatives. This paper will describe the academic entrepreneurship efforts of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, and the resulting ways RCM has been utilized to innovate, rejuvenate, and remunerate faculty and administrators in guiding and aligning their efforts toward important strategic directions. Implications for revenue generation, faculty development, and resource allocation, among other topics, will be discussed.},

West Virginia University Institute of Technology (WVU Tech) and various industries in the Upper Kanawha Valley region have designed a co-op program for undergraduate students that will require them to spend a day every week of the spring and fall semesters of the junior year and a part or the entire summer between the semesters with industries. Several students from the departments of electrical and computer engineering, mechanical as well as chemical engineering are expected to participate in this experiential learning program. Each student will have two mentors, one from the industry and the other is a faculty member from the student's parent department. The year-long program offers the student the opportunity to participate in design projects at a level which is not possible with the more traditional summer or internship employment. In addition to the design experience, students will have benefits in communication skills, exposure to industrial standards, safety training and safety considerations in designs, design implementation, and multidisciplinary teamwork.},

Web-development projects in particular typically require at least one database on the server. In addition, many multimedia and manufacturing projects require databases, anything from Product Data Management systems on a company intranet to collaborative multimedia in a classroom. What requisite knowledge does a student need to competently work with a database that comprises only a portion of a larger project? Which database management system(s) should a student learn and does one provide an advantage over the others?},

abstract={Due to time constraints and the lack of available educational materials, students in engineering and engineering technology often do not get an opportunity to work actual design problems in heat transfer. This is especially true for those students taking concentrations in machine design and manufacturing. Upon graduation they are frequently faced with heat transfer issues, where they must find usable data and make educated decisions. Capstone or design project courses frequently offer an opportunity to expose the student to applied heat transfer design problems. This paper describes the development and testing of a module that may be plugged into a design or project course to expose students to practical heat transfer design. Module elements include a review of heat transfer modes and mathematical models, as well as lecture and lab elements targeted toward problems frequently encountered in manufacturing processes.},

abstract={One way to provide powerful problem-solving experiences in science, mathematics, and technology is to engage students in novel problems that require them to assess a situation and then apply conceptual and procedural knowledge to its solution. Engineering offers an effective context for these problem situations. However, most practicing teachers do not have the knowledge or experience to create meaningful, engineering-based learning experiences. This paper will provide details about a program to enhance the ability of preservice and inservice teachers to make these engineering experiences possible for their future or current K-12 students. Providing teachers the training necessary to make use of such engineering contexts is crucial to the success of curricular improvement. An undergraduate engineering course has been offered for several years that began as an "engineering literacy" course and has developed into the basis for providing meaningful engineering contexts for national standards-based lessons. A graduate level engineering course for inservice teachers during the past three summers has not only provided similar training, but has also helped develop mentoring field experiences among the preservice and inservice teachers. In addition, freshmen Honors Program students take a research mentorship course in the spring of their first year. A group of Honors engineering and science majors are working to create K-12 activities based on engineering context. They are working with the education majors in the course previously mentioned in order to create standards-based, age-appropriate activities. Engineering and education faculty and students, working in teams, through the courses mentioned and the mentorship program, have developed activities that bring authentic learning in engineering contexts to science, mathematics, and technology education. Examples of such standards-based activities will be provided.},

abstract={Teaching statistics to undergraduate mechanical engineers is one of the required ABET program criteria, a criteria that is included under, but also predates EC 2000. To more effectively teach statistics to junior mechanical engineers, an experiment was created using a modified commercially-available golf analysis system that included an array of 53 floor-embedded light-sensors. Students measured the tempo (swing time), club speed, club angle and trajectory, and projected ball trajectory of typical golf swings for golfers and non-golfers. Analyzing the data (and comparing the results to PGA Tour Pros) taught students the basics of statistical analysis, including using mean, standard deviation, Student's t-test, and the F-test for the analysis of variability. This study was co-sponsored by the PGA Tour and the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, FL.},

abstract={The global persistence of warfare, aggression, oppression and political unrest testify to the growing vulnerability and impatience of those who live in conditions of extreme poverty. A larger injection of aid is needed to help stabilize the poorest countries: projects that promise only long-term results are inadequate responses to immediate needs. But in order to insure that this aid is not wasted, the population of these countries must be prepared to act in partnership with the donor nations in monitoring funds distribution and assessing their impact on the economic welfare of their countries. This paper argues two points. First, foreign aid in the US and other developed countries must be raised to a minimum of .7% of the combined GDP of the developed countries. Second, 10% of that foreign aid must be earmarked for higher learning in engineering and technology in order to increase economic development and its concomitant result, alleviation of poverty. With an adequately educated and trained indigenous workforce to help implement foreign assistance, chances are increased for sustainable improvement in the living standards of the people.},

abstract={Public information indicates that fewer American youth are selecting science and engineering as desired careers. General discussions with underrepresented populations revealed that most students view mathematics and science as very difficult subjects that require a lot of time and hard work to achieve above passing grades. As underrepresented populations become the majority in Texas and other midwestern states, innovative approaches must be developed to excite and encourage high school students to consider science and mathematics as primary building blocks for the future. The Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) NASA Center for Applied Radiation Research (CARR) adopted the concept of teaming with The Boy Scouts of America to establish joint Explorer Posts with local high schools as a primary component of outreach. The university and high school Math, Science or Environmental Clubs conduct various activities to excite and encourage middle and high school students to do their best in science and mathematics. The Boy Scouts of America insures each member, thus the university does not incur added liabilities. At the university level, the students get a greater vision of how our country, globe and universe are connected though various forms of science (environment) and mathematics (money). Selected activities and benefits are the primary topics of discussion.},

abstract={The new accreditation criteria (TC2K) of the Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET require an assessment of Program Intended Learning Outcomes. Some of the learning outcomes required by the "a" through "k" and the Civil criteria of TC2K include leadership skills, teamwork skills, project management skills, communication skills, and design and construction skills. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the American Institute for Steel Construction (AISC) sponsors regional and national concrete canoe and steel bridge competitions on an annual basis. The Civil Engineering Technology (CET) students at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) have participated in these competitions for the past nine years. These competitions give students a chance to apply what they have learned in the classroom. To assess the impact of the concrete canoe and steel bridge competitions on student learning and development, the authors carried out a survey of current students and graduates of the CET program at RIT who have been members of the concrete canoe and steel bridge teams. The issues addressed in our survey include the following: impact of these activities on leadership skills, communication skills, teamwork skills, design and construction skills, project management skills, confidence levels, students' enthusiasm for the profession, and a positive image and exposure for students and CET programs. In this paper, we discuss the results of this survey and some of the challenges to student participation in these non-credit activities at RIT, and present some suggestions for enhancing the level of student participation.},

With its early involvement in distance education, the TM faculty has experienced a wide array of technologies and issues surrounding distance education. The program is now one of the largest graduate programs on campus and is made up of both on-site and distance learners. In this paper we discuss some of the relevant issues regarding delivery of a technology-oriented program that is suitable for both on-site and distance learners. Recent advances in technology provide opportunities for improving course organization and efficiency, creating audio or video enhanced content delivery, providing for interactive self-evaluative student experiences, and revising faculty and student interaction. In addition to multi-media considerations for delivery of content, successful faculty will also consider student learning styles, course management, evaluation and assessment, as well as the programmatic supxport systems necessary for overall program delivery.},

abstract={This paper will describe and summarize a two-year project using hands-on activities to introduce K-12 students to Electrical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Technology and inspire and foster an interest in engineering, mathematics, and science. Two specific projects included in this initiative were: S developing new summer hands-on workshops for students entering grades 5 through 10 through the 'Young Scholars' summer on-campus program, and S deployments of the Mobile Electronics Manufacturing Line (MEML) to schools in the area, exposing additional students to electrical engineering / electrical technology with hands-on experiments. These deployments were coordinated with the help of K-12 teachers. We were able to reach 111 students through our summer workshops as part of the Young Scholars program at IUPUI, and just over 800 students through deployments of the MEML. The paper will summarize the efforts within the project, address funding, discuss results and emphasize lessons learned when approaching a large scale K-12 project. Many roadblocks were encountered over the two year period, and these lessons should prove valuable to anyone proposing such a project.},

abstract={In manufacturing engineering education, there is a need for problem-solving projects that reflect real issues to supplement or replace drill and practice problems. Authentic activities offer an opportunity to apply new knowledge and skills to manufacturing engineering problems, test theories, and draw conclusions in a safe environment with the help of their peers and mentors. Case studies add relevance and real world context to manufacturing engineering education. At Greenfield Coalition, two case studies were developed on the basis of real issues faced by the Focus:HOPE Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT), a tier-one supplier to the automotive industry. The first involves determining why some, but not all, batches of aluminum manifold castings discolor during machining. The second study involves stabilizing bore dimensions for a pulley used in the manufacture of diesel engines. Both studies require the student teams to brainstorm potential causes, generate solutions and select the best method for elimination of the problem. The final deliverable for each case is a report similar to one that might be presented to management. By employing case studies in manufacturing engineering education, students learn to apply skills and techniques to new situations just as they would have to perform on the job.},

abstract={Literature is replete with studies of performance appraisal systems used in Engineering Technology (ET) personnel reviews and those studies conclude that the performance appraisal systems are not above reproach, and that there are inherent problems with any performance appraisal system. A further review of literature uncovered a number of alternatives for the potential problems associated with the performance appraisal systems for technical managers, and their lack of effectiveness. For this research study, the inherent problems of performance appraisals using 'forced ranking system' was investigated and the adverse effects of forced ranking of technical managers was examined. In many organizations peers, employees and managers have begun to experience the adverse effects of the use or misuse of forced ranking. Without warning, employees experience feelings of loss, grief and resentment for receiving the brand or label of a "poor performer." Certainly, there is a need to analyze and identify employees that require encouragement to become more productive, but a company should refrain from creating an atmosphere of fear causing its staff to question their reason for continued employment. This research was designed to determine the effect of forced ranking system (FRS) on employee performance and productivity. It is hypothesized that performance and productivity are negatively affected by a forced ranking system of performance appraisal. The null hypothesis is H 0:μ 1 = μ 2 . The alternate hypothesis is H 1:μ 1 ≠ μ 2. (control group = 1 and experimental group =2.) The hypothesis will be tested by the responses of a sample of respondents from business and industry.},

abstract={As part of the effort to prepare future Information Technology (IT) workers, the Center for Information Technology and Community Development (CITCD) at the College of Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati established the Summer Academy of Information Technology (SAIT), a summer enrichment program that introduces high school students in under-served communities to IT. The first session of SAIT was scheduled for a two-week period. The development of the program faced several challenges in the area of recruiting students, administration, pedagogy and others. One of the main challenges in designing the program was in developing the curriculum, which had to address several focus areas of IT and be appropriate for the level of understanding of high school students from varied (and often unknown or unclear) backgrounds. Project-based learning was the pedagogical approach employed within the program. The curriculum had to be general enough to match the diverse backgrounds of the students and at the same time specific enough to enable them to finish a relevant, non-trivial IT project within the two-week time period in order for them to experience tangible proof of what they had learned and accomplished. This paper reports on the development of the SAIT and on the results of implementing it for the first SAIT session during summer 2002.},

abstract={Student researchers face daunting challenges when attempting to commercialize technology that they have developed. Engineering students typically lack an overall understanding of the commercialization process associated with academic research. Furthermore, the resources required span several disciplines including law, business, and engineering. Only recently have engineering programs included entrepreneurial courses covering the basic concepts that are essential for technology business development. At the University of Michigan, such courses include an MBA business plan development sequence that is elected by an increasing number of engineering graduate students, an undergraduate engineering course in business plan development, and a patent law class specifically for engineering students. Academic resources such as these significantly increase the likelihood of stimulating student entrepreneurial activity and of successful commercialization of university research. However, these resources alone are typically insufficient. Professional resources, such as those offered by the Office of Technology Transfer and the Sam Zell and Robert H. Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at Michigan, provide business development support ranging from one-on-one business development counseling to grant programs for emerging businesses. This paper discusses a complete process of commercializing engineering research. Critical academic and professional resources supporting this process are described as well as how these resources have fostered entrepreneurial activity, contributing to successful commercialization of engineering research at the University of Michigan. Several of the challenges faced by the student entrepreneur have been addressed by these resources at Michigan, while others still require development that is underway. Here the authors report on these activities, while aspiring to foster inspiration for the development of entrepreneurial resources at engineering institutions across the country.},

abstract={Enhancing the preparation of engineering students to deal with real construction projects requires the development of their abilities to handle several engineering concepts in an integrated fashion. This paper presents an integrated approach to delivering construction engineering education using new technologies capable of providing an environment to handle real construction situations with manageable pieces of knowledge available in flexible representations media. In this approach, a computer-based system will be developed to allow the housing of the knowledge of different concepts in formats that can be integrated and used for several purposes and construction engineering aspects. The formats contain representations including sections of digital videos related to construction methods and materials, schedules as well as design alternatives. These representations are organized in association with construction projects components to provide effective compilation and manipulation to support integrated analytical and decision-making processes. The proposed approach will provide the educator with an effective mechanism to deliver the construction knowledge by integrating several concepts in the course, which will help prepare engineers to solve real construction situations.},

abstract={The area of pavement design and management has seen important changes over the years that are the results of numerous federally funded research programs and changes in professional practices. Most road networks are largely in place, and the more urgent focus of various transportation agencies is on cost-effective ways of maintaining the existing networks. Consequently, pavement design and management has become a "hot" area of research and professional development. A pilot project involving the development of a new technical elective that incorporates recent innovations in pavement design, management, and especially maintenance has been undertaken at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown (UPJ). The course offers an important career path for students and insights into current practices in an important field of transportation. Interested students who take the course may have an employment advantage, especially with State Departments of Transportation. At a higher level, the course aims to ensure that the Civil Engineering Technology (CET) program not only meets accreditation requirements, but also meets the demands of industry. The development of the course also keeps the instructor abreast of the profession and allows exploring research opportunities in this area. The major steps followed in the development process included a literature review of recent articles and books dealing with aspects of pavement design and management, contacting government and private agencies regarding current technologies and professional practices, and designing exercises utilizing the latest standards employed in the industry for hands-on student training.},

abstract={Machine Learning has traditionally been a topic of research and instruction in computer science and computer engineering programs. Yet, due to its wide applicability in a variety of fields, its research use has expanded in other disciplines, such as electrical engineering, industrial engineering, civil engineering, and mechanical engineering. Currently, many undergraduate and first-year graduate students in the aforementioned fields do not have exposure to recent research trends in Machine Learning. This paper reports on a project in progress, funded by the National Science Foundation under the program Combined Research and Curriculum Development (CRCD), whose goal is to remedy this shortcoming. The project involves the development of a model for the integration of Machine Learning into the undergraduate curriculum of those engineering and science disciplines mentioned above. The goal is increased exposure to Machine Learning technology for a wider range of students in science and engineering than is currently available. Our approach of integrating Machine Learning research into the curriculum involves two components. The first component is the incorporation of Machine Learning modules into the first two years of the curriculum with the goal of sparking student interest in the field. The second is the development of new upper level Machine Learning courses for advanced undergraduate students. The paper will describe the first phase of the project, that of the integration of Machine Learning concepts into introductory engineering and science programming courses through appropriately designed programming projects.},

abstract={High-performance computing (HPC) platforms are becoming increasingly accessible to scientists and engineers due the remarkable decrease in commodity hardware costs. The promise of HPC allows engineers to perform more detailed analysis of complex systems in shorter times. Ultimately, design cycle times can be reduced and reliability can be increased by utilizing new HPC facilities. However, barriers to effective use of existing and emerging HPC technologies remain. In fact, few researchers and engineers possess the knowledge to benefit from the current computing capabilities. In response to this unheralded demand, a pilot course for exposing engineering students to new technologies and capabilities in the computing world has been developed. As a result, not only have student participants become HPC savvy, but also the research community as a whole has expressed intense interest in the continuation and expansion of the initial project. This surge in interest is derived from the fact that student participants have been able to solve problems that were previously not considered because of their computational requirements. In other words, science has been advanced because of this single class offering.},

abstract={Academic power engineering programs have been in a state of decline for numerous years. During this same timeframe, technology and the application of power electronics has been growing at a rapid pace. Additionally, the utility industry has experienced a dramatic change in regulation, the end of the Cold War has reshaped U.S. defense considerations and impressed new requirements on military systems, and the U.S. economy has both soared and slumped. Integral to the success of the U.S. economy is cost-effective and reliable power generation and transmission. Electrical brown-out or black-out events result in a loss of production capability or necessitate expensive backup generation equipment; soaring utility costs mean less capital for both product development and workforce expansion. This paper begins with an overview of the U.S. economic trends that have influenced the employment demand for power and power electronic engineers. The demand for new talent will then be evaluated in the context of the demand for more-capable and cost-effective military platforms. In particular, the technological requirements of an "Electric Warship" will underscore the need for engineering graduates, both civilian and military. Next, an assessment is offered on the current state of electric power programs within the academic community for meeting these needs. In recognition of projected technology-driven military platforms, an enhanced power engineering concentration within the electrical engineering curricula at the Naval Academy has been proposed. The paper will conclude with an overview of the selection process for curriculum topics, course sequencing, and laboratory content.},

abstract={Students mature during their engineering education moving from being a student of science and technology to becoming an apprentice engineer. This process will occur regardless of the practical experience held by the engineering faculty. However, maturation may be deepened by the apt use of experienced-based instruction (EBI). This paper examines the usefulness of engineering experience as a teaching tool. Assessment of student readiness and receptivity should be considered in determining when to use experienced-based instruction. EBI can motivate the student by showing relevance of the topic and appealing to the student's sense of curiosity or adventure. EBI can broaden the topic by altering the "point-of-view" of the student. And last, EBI can allow the student to get a sense of what is expected from an engineer by his clients, employer, peers, and the public. Deciding how to insert the engineering experience requires planning. Reading assignments, videos, web-based information, personal stories, role-playing exercises, simulations, games, and carefully crafted problem-solving exercises are tools that play a part in the delivery of EBI. This paper discusses the use of EBI in a series of geotechnical courses offered to juniors and seniors at the US Air Force Academy (USAFA). The when and how issues are illustrated in four courses that include an introductory course, two required courses and a design elective. The success and limitations of EBI are examined with emphasis on when and how to insert meaningful, effective and appropriate EBI.},

abstract={At Northeastern University, students are learning how to solve real life engineering problems as they provide hands-on solutions to industrial control systems problems in a real time engineering environment. Students are required to team-develop solutions to real life problems as provided to them by industry professionals in a simulated engineering scenario. Through the application of the team design concept, students work together to provide "complete& solutions to presented problems. This paper chronicles an assigned project from initial definition to a student team's final report including hardware and software solution. Students are treated as engineers throughout and are expected to compile necessary information on their own to solve presented problems. This project brings together many of the courses and cooperative work experiences that students have had during their college tenure.},

abstract={The city of Hyderabad, an explosively growing metropolis located in the south central region of India, experiences hot and dry summers and generally warm day temperatures most of the year. The building construction approaches and techniques currently in use involve excessive use of cement, brick and reinforced concrete with no insulation, resulting in considerable thermal discomfort to occupants several months in a year. To meet the objectives of "climate responsive building design & construction", an initiative at Muffakham Jah College of Engineering & Technology (MJCET), entitled Centre for Environment Studies & Socioresponsive Engineering, has conceived and developed the design of "The Natural House". This has been set up as an undergraduate R&D project, supervised by two faculty members (the two authors of this paper). It is expected that following the R&D phase the students - a group of twenty-three mechanical engineering juniors, including eight female students, will construct a small "Natural House". The House is being designed for maximum compatibility with the natural surroundings and uses a wide spectrum of principles modeled on the homeostatic and self-regulating behavior of biological and ecological systems. The overall design objective is to ensure maximum energy efficiency, low construction and maintenance cost, thermal comfort without air-conditioning, high aesthetic quality and intimate contact with the natural elements. The paper describes the architectural and engineering principles used and our attempt to provide an inspired student group an opportunity to fully exercise their creative imagination and "learn by doing".},

abstract={New "hands-on experiences" are being incorporated into the undergraduate civil engineering program at Rensselaer. The aim is to have students see real civil systems; better relate their classroom knowledge to the real world; tie their knowledge together, within and across the disciplines; and learn how to learn through experimental investigation and analysis. Various options are being explored ranging from three two-credit classes to a set of experience modules distributed across all four years. The areas being addressed are structural, geotechnical, transportation, and environmental engineering. The experiences will range from basic experiments to multi-disciplinary charettes. Some of the more advanced ones will emphasize simulation, where virtual systems are compared with their real-world counterparts. Others will tie together concepts from several disciplines. Some will be visits to construction sites, traffic management centers, and special lab facilities at other universities. This paper describes the experiences being devised, their potential packaging, and the findings from a pilot implementation. Overall, the experiences will help the students tie their classroom knowledge to the real world.},

abstract={Much of the information used in libraries is handled and processed through databases. Often an individual has primary responsibility for data entry of information from many people. If the database has restricted access or is stored on a local machine, then the data entry person may also have the responsibility for retrieving information. Database-to-web technologies can be used to allow individuals throughout the libraries to enter information directly to a central database and retrieve information, removing the additional step performed by a data entry person. Applications for web interactions with databases can be as diverse as an instruction reporting form, a list of books on approval for faculty review and a subject list of databases. This paper will provide a brief overview of some of the technologies available to create database-to-web applications, describe three projects which use this approach and mention how those applications can enhance library services and operations. The ability to generate low-maintenance pages and incorporate advanced information technologies enhances services to patrons while freeing staff for other more innovative tasks.},

abstract={The Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of South Carolina has embarked upon a project to enhance the Mechatronics education of non-EE engineering students. NSF funds the project with cost-share by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the College of Engineering and Information Technology. An essential part of this project is the construction of functional modules for teaching hands-on skills related to the interfacing of mechanical, electrical, and electronic components of a Mechatronics system. Non-EE engineering students have the need for hands-on experience to increase their ability and confidence in tackling electrical and electronics concepts, especially during the realization phase of a Mechatronics project. To address this need, we started developing a suit of functional teaching modules. These functional modules are intended as bolt-on building blocks with clearly defined inputs and outputs, and an explanation of the underlying operational principles. The students are expected to use the functional modules as a learning tool. After understanding their functionality, they are expected to duplicate the circuitry on their own breadboards to be incorporated into their Mechatronics class projects, as well as into other hands-on projects, as appropriate.},

abstract={Modular instruction in two Mathematics courses was introduced by the Engineering Sciences Department of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines. Printed learning modules of Plane Trigonometry and Solid Geometry were developed to allow its Engineering Freshmen to learn these courses at their own pace. The challenged posed by this fact to engineering educators is to provide a learning situation where the learner may discover potentials and utillize them to the fullest in order to obtain and practice the knowledge required of future engineering professionals. The use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the development of self-learning materials has made learning more fun and exciting.},

abstract={An overview of regular courses of study in undergraduate Civil Engineering at the University of Florida (UF) and the Mahanakorn University of Technology (MUT), Thailand, is compared. The curriculum systems are alike in terms of courses provided and credit hours requirements. These similarities are to provide necessary preparatory courses such as mathematics, chemistry, and physics, which serve as a foundation for the engineering degree. A number of basic engineering courses are taken to complete the core curriculum required of all engineering students. In upper division, students concentrate on their major field of study- civil engineering, which is composed of Structural, Construction Management, Transportation, Geo-technical, Water Resource, and General Civil Engineering. UF-Civil Engineering education mainly concentrates on technical excellence, communication skills, and a well-rounded general and multidisciplinary education. Whereas, the MUT focuses on balanced distribution of fundamental knowledge and practice to reach the society needs. The procedure to obtain license for working as a professional engineer is a major factor that indicates the difference between the two departments. Even though, the curriculum structure may appear dissimilar in minor but the main objectives are indisputably based on the same direction to incorporate many of different civil engineering aspects; in private practice, in academia, in public practice and in combination with other disciplines. Moreover, the action in the ideas of global perspective has been developing in both universities for the future of Civil Engineering.},

abstract={Technology is a rapidly changing field, it is monumental task for a college or university to keep pace with these changes. As corporate demand for specialized computer hardware and software training increases, it is becoming very challenging to find and retain full time faculty to teach in these areas, and to effectively integrate rapidly changing technology into our curricula. The University of Hartford's S.I. Ward College of Technology has engaged in a successful strategic partnership with New Horizons Corporation to provide specialized computer training for students. This collaboration has provided the University and New Horizons with the ability to offer Microsoft® certified training and certification testing for our students while earning University of Hartford credit. This program allows the University to keep pace with the changing technology needs of potential employers of our graduates while not requiring a significant investment of resources. This program has the potential to provide several significant outcomes; it can improve enrollment, increase corporate visibility of S.I. Ward College of Technology, offer our students marketable skills, serve local industry by providing lifelong educational opportunities for employees, and create a new income for the college. These outcomes have helped to foster an expanding and advantageous relationship between industry and engineering technology. This paper will outline the necessary steps to initiate, develop, assess, and gain university approval for these types of collaborative education agreements. These agreements between industry and academia can help us to meet today's demand for rapidly changing technological educational needs.},

abstract={The Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program (STOMP) at Tufts University brings engineering students to educational settings to support engineering education. In December 2000, Massachusetts incorporated engineering into its state science and technology frameworks. Educators are now working to integrate these new standards into their classroom teachings. Many educators are not familiar with engineering concepts so they are working hard to learn new concepts at the same time as they are implementing projects and teachings to address the frameworks in their settings. STOMP students, engineering undergraduate and graduate students, serve as a support mechanism for these educators by helping students with hands-on projects, resolving technical issues with equipment, answering engineering questions, doing research on topics, and helping to brainstorm activities. The program has been very successful in facilitating engineering education in 10 local classrooms in grades K-9. STOMP student teacher partnerships have resulted in some fabulous new curriculum units including a 4 th grade unit entitled "Egyptians as Engineers" and a middle school unit entitled "Make your own CD Learning Digital Logic." The STOMP program also strives to help engineering students understand the educational system and to encourage their involvement, as future members of industry, in K-12 education. This paper will detail the creation and implementation of a project of this nature as well as highlight the difficulties and successes experienced to date.},

abstract={This article describes how a group of faculty members at the School of Engineering, Université de Sherbrooke, Canada, are going about implementing a novel and fully integrated approach to developing in engineering undergraduate students the competencies linked to the human dimension of engineering. First, a critical and skeptical eye is being used to describe and assess the results of the traditional modus operandi coined "the two solitudes": "soft" courses taught by non-engineers on one part, and technical courses taught by engineering professors who are ill-equipped to dwelve to any meaningful depth in such topics as ethics, team work, communication, leadership, creativity, critical thinking, engineering management, etc. on the other part. This article then describes how, after an exhaustive survey of the literature, a grant from the University's Major Pedagogical Innovations Program is being used to devise ways in which the development of the interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies of engineering students will be intimately integrated throughout the whole undergraduate programs with that of the scientific and technical competencies. This entire process is under the responsibility of engineering professors. In order for this ambitious goal to be achieved, the group of faculty put together a strategic plan based on the professional aspects of engineering practice and which calls for five separate but complementary courses of action: a continuous technology watch, a research program, the design of appropriate pedagogical material, the training of engineering professors in the use of this material, the online classroom use of same material and, lastly, the publication of results. The article ends with an analysis of the results achieved so far and an optimistic look at the future that this novel approach allows to envisage.},

abstract={The fast pace of product development has caused a need for both managerial and technical graduates who are able to solve problems. In the area of Industrial Education, new methods are needed to enhance problem-solving skills. Industry generated product ideas are turned over to Engineering Technology and Technical Graphics students for design, drawing, and prototyping. This presentation examines the value of Industry/Education cooperation in regard to improving product development and sales as well as examining it's effect on student scores, skills, and self esteem. Both beneficial and detrimental factors to industrial and educational cooperation are discussed. Various groups of students were tested at different levels of instruction before and after being assigned industry partners in the development of new products. Significant increases in standardized test scores and design skills were noted after the cooperative development of these designs and prototypes. Various uses for product design and prototyping partnerships in education and industry are examined and their benefits to students, educators, administrators, and industry are examined. While the time constraints placed on both the students and the instructors is a problem, the benefits are great enough to make this cooperation worthwhile. The use of advanced technology is expensive but there are various ways to defray the cost of this technology to both education and industry. Cooperative ventures of this kind result in more ideas going into production, increase student learning, and help small-scale production facilities increase their profitability.},

A post-visit analysis of these various assessment methods provided insight into lessons learned as to how well each method worked for each department. Although many assessment methods were, in general, similar from department to department (e.g., surveys or coursework) the implementation (and success) of these methods often differed considerably from department to department. Of even more interest were those methods that were unique to departments (e.g., self-assessments of individual courses) and the success of these methods. Comparison and contrast of these assessment methods replete with lessons learned can provide valuable feedback not only to individual departments within the UW COE, but also for departments at other universities still preparing for their first visits under ABET EC2000.},

abstract={The Chemical Engineering Departments at North Carolina A&T State University (NCA&TSU) and Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) have collaborated in a USAID linkage program to enhance the pollution prevention activities in Bangladesh through joint curriculum development and research project programs. Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest and most densely populated countries. Environmental pollution, especially surface water pollution, is a significant problem with increased industrial activities in the textile and fertilizer sectors. Thus, sustainable planning and management of water resources has become a priority consideration for the future welfare of Bangladesh. BUET is benefiting from the linkage program in the following areas: faculty development in pollution prevention, curriculum development in pollution prevention, facility and equipment plan development, and development of collaborative research in pollution prevention with emphasis on surface and groundwater contamination and water purification. Cost savings and sustainability of the linkage are being encouraged through an emphasis on the use of electronic conferencing technology. It is hoped that through these activities, BUET would become a national resource for educating engineering students at the undergraduate and graduate levels in pollution prevention, and that as these students enter positions of leadership in industry and government, they will use their training to make wise decisions for the future of the environment in Bangladesh.},

The key to this type of technical design lies in the fact that the courses would follow established design concepts developed by engineering and that there would be prime emphasis on standard design procedures and practices. Many of these design methods have already been included in handbooks or standard computer methods for various branches of engineering. These courses would require an understanding of the application of mathematics and science, for example, to such activities as [HVAC] air conditioning systems design, duct design, piping design, amplifier design, computer component and circuit design, plant layout, materials handling operations, and/or civil engineering technology applications such as road design.".},

abstract={Structural protection using active control systems is becoming common practice due to three factors: 1) safety, in order to protect the lives of occupants; 2) the high cost of reconstruction or repair of structures including the social cost incurred while the structure is out of service; and 3) the low cost of reliable electro-mechanical systems required for implementation of an active control system. Structural Analysis and Design (SAD) and Control and Instrumentation Electronics (CIE) are two University of Houston-Downtown Engineering Technology B.S. degree programs that are ideally related in the field of active control of civil structures. SAD deals with the analysis and design of structures, their loads, and failure modes. CIE deals with the design of systems for control of processes. The study of how to design active controls for structures that respond favorably to imposed loads and deformations is a problem that naturally connects the two disciplines. The Engineering Technology Department at the University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) has a structural laboratory that was developed with funds provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). After the NSF grant was implemented, the laboratory developed additional facilities for testing and determining the behavior of structures. During Fall 2001 a student appointed as a Shell Scholar (Shell Scholars are student assistants that are other students) developed a test rig for active control of structures. The paper presents the factors used for design of the test rig and illustrates specific examples of active control of structures in the laboratory. This paper also shows how two seemingly different engineering technology majors can function in a synergistic environment for the benefit of students in both programs.},

abstract={Organized by the Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, SPINE is a partnership among 10 technical colleges and universities to identify and share educational practices in engineering and computer science; three schools are in the United States (Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech and MIT) and seven are in Europe. Five disciplines are chosen for assessment - chemical engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, materials science and engineering, and mechanical engineering. Assessment of current practices is achieved through quantitative and qualitative questionnaires completed by administrators of each school, questionnaires completed by faculty at the school, and on-site interviews with deans, department heads and senior administration of the school. Additionally, surveys of alumni, human resources managers, and line managers in industry provide external views to support assessment of the schools' educational practices. Practices at a school are compared with the vision, mission and goals developed by the school. The findings and conclusions of the study are shared among all the universities with the goal of identifying what educational practices work best with respect to the goals of the particular school. To our knowledge, this is the first international benchmarking study of engineering education, and the study provides a unique networking opportunity among the institutions on an international scale. In this talk we present the most significant results of the SPINE study and contrast educational practices between US and European colleges of engineering.},

An experiment that required students to determine the coefficient of drag for a small, dollar-store parachute figurine was selected. After a brief introduction to the pertinent theory, students were tasked to determine a governing equation for the experiment, identify measurable variables, generate concepts for experimental procedures, evaluate them based on customer requirements, conduct the experiment, analyze the results, and suggest improvements for subsequent iterations. Survey data indicates that most students enjoyed the project even though it required hard work, and that most learned how to design an optimal experimental procedure.},

abstract={Emerging technologies in engineering challenge the new generation of engineers to work in more specialized environments. Universities in turn are faced with the challenge of training students with the skills that will help them to adapt into a dynamic industrial environment within a brief period of time. This challenge must be met within a 4-year curriculum with a fixed number of credit hours that students must take to complete the program. Of these a good number is reserved for non-engineering courses. Therefore, the hours available for engineering courses are rather limited and must be used efficiently to ensure that students acquire the skills needed for a rapidly changing work environment. To better address industry/government professional requirements, a curriculum must be such that it can adapt to and benefit from newer instrumentation, techniques, software and hardware to stay relevant to industry's needs. In this paper, we will address how the Mechanical Engineering Department at Alabama A&M University has utilized input from its constituencies and professional organizations to begin the process of continuous improvement of the manufacturing systems track of the Mechanical Engineering Program.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to examine systemic issues that impact the design, delivery, and maintenance of asynchronous engineering management educational products. Asynchronous education continues to rapidly evolve as an alternative to traditional classroom delivery. An asynchronous educational system requires the effective integration of technology, supporting processes, and infrastructure design to prepare, deliver, and maintain asynchronous educational products. Currently, the technological capabilities for delivery of asynchronous education have outstripped the ability to maximize those advanced technologies. To help understand this rift between technology and our ability to deploy that technology this paper examines three critical areas. First, the distinctions between asynchronous, distance (interactive televised), and live instruction are examined from a perspective of immediacy. Second, based on initial experiences in preparation and delivery of asynchronous education, a systemic issues perspective is developed. Finally, implications of systems design principles are presented as a guide for more effective future design of asynchronous educational products in engineering management.},

At our university, engineering seniors begin the spacecraft design courses having some project teamwork experience, but mostly for short duration projects. We instructors have found that our students don't necessarily possess the skills required to be productive members of a larger engineering team for an entire semester. To help the students work better in teams during the spacecraft design experience, we have implemented a series of exercises and structures. This paper outlines the tools we have used to enable teaming, the grading strategies we have implemented and the interdisciplinary aspects of our design teams.},

abstract={ABET 2000 accreditation criteria have substantially changed the philosophy of establishing the equivalency of programs within engineering education, and in particular, equivalency between programs offered in different nations. Under the old (pre-2000) system, course equivalencies might be established by simply showing that the same textbook was used in each course. However, with the newer guidelines, the standard of accreditation is based on "outcomes assessment" and now includes many more "soft" measures than was previously the case. The procedure for establishing some equivalency for a student who spends a semester or longer abroad as part of an accredited US engineering program, is now more ambiguous. In this paper, a review of the ABET 2000 criteria as they relate to international exchange agreements is given. In particular, a student who shows the independence and motivation to participate in a study abroad program actually strengthens the satisfaction of many of the softer ABET 2000 criteria by virtue of the demands he/she must meet in order to successfully complete the study abroad program.},

abstract={On July 1, 2000 Stevens Institute of Technology created a new Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (SEEM) department. Through a unique partnership with industry and selected government agencies in the area of short courses, graduate programs, and applied research, the department has grown to over 60 masters and 30 PhD students in one year. In terms of revenue from short courses and off campus programs, the department is now second within the school of engineering. This paper will provide the details and lessons learned of how we designed, marketed, and executed three non traditional certificate and masters programs and two PhD degree granting programs centered on technology, engineering, systems, and management. Partnership with industry and government agencies within key market domains was the cornerstone of our strategy. At the strategic level we will discuss ideas on how to target market large employers of engineers, attracting faculty, balancing resource allocation for income activities versus break even or money losing activities such as research and undergraduate education, partnering with traditional engineering departments, the role of web based learning, and most importantly managing expectations for growth and income. Other seemingly trite yet important issues such as the naming of programs, how to best utilize web versus hard copy for marketing information, the role of an advisory board, and how to create the environment of mutual beneficial existence with the traditional engineering departments will also be discussed. This paper, though hardly a road map for creating new programs or a department, will provide insight to the thought processes and steps needed to create modern and relevant programs to educate engineers in the 21 st century.},

abstract={At the Pennsylvania College of Technology, we feel that the tools of project design and management, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), should be taught along with the more usual subjects in a Civil Engineering Technology curriculum. Such a tool is an application of some very basic concepts to design and construction. Students learn the use and construction of coordinated Digital Terrain Models (DTM), from which mapping is derived and manipulation of an existing GIS for project planning and construction management using the Intergraph MGE system. Our portfolio includes associate's degrees in both Civil Engineering Technology (CT) and Surveying Technology (SUT) and a bachelor's program in Civil Engineering Technology with emphasis in Surveying (BCT), all ABET (TAC) accredited. The use of GIS is taught to students in all degrees. A more advanced course in Land Use/Information is part of the BCT program. The advanced course is the subject of this presentation. In this course, students construct and query a GIS. They learn, from a Civil Engineering standpoint, how to manipulate coordinate and attribute data, and set up and populate attribute data tables. Students then choose to use Fortran90, C++ or Pascal, all higher order languages required by ABET (TAC), to compute answers specific to a planned project, customizing the reports from GIS enhancements. Covered as well in this course are State Plane Coordinates algorithms and the procedures available to merge coordinate data from different projections and datums.},

Faculty in the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) recently examined the philosophical justification of offering course material involving the technical enterprise (entrepreneurship) into the engineering curriculum. One of the important issues considered by the faculty was the question of what should be taught in engineering and what should be taught in business and other disciplines. This paper discusses the educational and philosophical approach to development of the multi-disciplinary course (titled "The Enterprise of Technology: From Lab to Market") as well as considerations in the implementation of the course.},

abstract={Technology education at the university level can be grouped into: Engineering Technology (ET) and Industrial Technology (IT) Programs. These programs are primarily focusing on applications in Engineering Science. A typical IT curriculum includes: hands-on type of experience courses, courses on humanities, liberal arts, physiology, management, economic, etc. The graduates of these programs are workforce that can be used in many workplaces such as: industry, government, educational institutes, financial institutions, etc. Although the graduate of IT programs has a wide scope of knowledge in many areas, he or she can still suffer from a lack of some fundamentals in mathematics, and core courses that are considered as core elements in building a sound skeleton of a scientific knowledge. It is believed that by efficient design of the IT curriculum many of these pitfalls can be avoided. In this paper a case study of a program design and development in industrial technology in Computer Integrated Design and Manufacturing Technology (CIDMT) will be shown. The conflicting factors to be considered and resolved in the curriculum design will be highlighted and discussed.},

abstract={The substantial advances in Internet technology of the past decade have tremendously facilitated rapid, relatively inexpensive communications around the globe. In education, a great variety of creative, easy to implement, budget oriented collaborative projects between domestic and overseas colleges and universities have become a reality. The Globetech International Joint-Venture Project Simulation developed and offered on the Internet free of charge by Cooper Union for the past seven years, is one of those successful collaborative projects. The simulation was developed under the auspices of the Gateway Engineering Education Coalition. More than 350 students and faculty from 12 engineering and business schools, from five countries on three continents, have participated in the seven Globetech simulations offered up to now. The project aims at developing students' practical global technology management, and other multidisciplinary skills, through the creation and negotiation of Requests of Proposals (RFP's) and Proposals for several international joint-venture projects each year. In the same time, since most of the projects deal with new, clean, renewable energy sources, or other new technologies, the simulation has the added benefit of exposing the students to practical engineering and managerial concerns they might encounter in their future careers. It also gives them an ethical background related to sustainable development and environmental issues, which will play a major role in the years to come. This article presents our positive and sometimes not so positive experiences with this project, and aims to encourage other schools to participate in this, or similar projects.},

abstract={This curriculum development project on multiphase transport phenomena draws on the research experiences from nine research laboratories at The University of Akron, Michigan State University, and the University of Tulsa. The objective of the project is to develop a new curriculum for teaching undergraduate and graduate students multiphase computational fluid dynamics for advanced design. The impact of multiphase flow research on solving practical engineering problems is an integral part of the learning experience. Industrial participants in the project provide specific design problems related to emerging technologies. Students are taught the fundamentals of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) during a one-week workshop. This is followed by an Internet course on multiphase transport phenomena. The students work in teams on CFD design problems with a faculty and industrial mentor. The salient results of this NSF/CRCD project are presented in this paper.},

abstract={In July 2001, Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT) hosted a weeklong resident Technology Space Camp for high school students from Oregon, Washington and Colorado. The students participated in various class and team building projects applicable to zero gravity space science and exploration. The highlight of their week was the design and construction of a zero gravity experiment. In August 2001, the OIT NASA Science Team subsequently flew the high school student's experiment, along with the college student's own experiment onboard NASA's KC-135A aircraft, the Weightless Wonder. Under the guise of their senior project, the OIT students proposed, designed and built their experiment through participation in the Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program. A primary objective of participation in the NASA program is to provide an outreach component for the project, hence, the Technology Space Camp. The partnership between NASA, a college senior project team and high school students, illustrates how industry, higher education, and pre-college initiatives can work jointly to promote Engineering Technology. Ongoing participation in the NASA program is used as a tool to recruit top students throughout the state of Oregon and the Northwest. A second Technology Space Camp is planned for Summer 2002. This paper will discuss the organization, implementation, and course material of the Technology Space Camp, with the expectation that other technology schools might use this information as a blueprint for their participation in similar programs.},

Nanotechnology, cryonics, cloning, quantum computing, cyber-intelligence and genetic engineering each hold the potential of radically altering the fundamental nature of human life. Therefore, their consideration is warranted in an engineering ethics curriculum. An extraordinary teaching experience with undergraduate students at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), suggests that intergenerational dialogue is one pedagogy that can enliven and enhance the undergraduate engineer's ability to engage moral deliberation about technology and the future. This paper recounts one such intergenerational experience, highlighting excerpts from dialogues which occurred, and from student essays which reflect upon them, as documentation of the exceptional effectiveness of this profound teaching technique.},

abstract={Can pedagogical techniques developed for Internet courses be integrated to enhance "live" classes, and what impact might this have on the "seat time' requirements of those live classes? Electronic technologies are rapidly altering the nature of university-level classes. These changes challenge accepted standards of what constitutes a "class" and its value as expressed in credit hours. Connect time for an Internet course does not equal seat time when most of the work is done offline and asynchronously. We believe that the arbitrary "seat time" requirement for live classes has lost its utility when the live portion of the class can be appropriately complemented with pedagogical tools developed for Internet courses. Using new teaching tools should permit enhanced student outcomes with less "seat time". We propose an ongoing discussion of the paradox of requiring "seat time" in an era of revolutionary opportunity to enhance pedagogy.},

abstract={Engineers, regardless of their areas of specialization, routinely are involved in projects with broad public policy implications. For example, engineers usually play a leading role in the design, permitting, and construction of controversial facilities. In addition, the design and development of any new technology often requires support or involvement from the public as well as the government. In many cases, engineers are poorly prepared to handle political, administrative and legal processes that are vitally important in the implementation of almost any engineering design, construction, or development project. Engineers also miss important opportunities to participate in the development of public policy at the highest levels, including the legislative process and agency rule-making, due to a lack of familiarity and relative comfort with the applicable processes. Consequently, the public and governmental bodies are denied the benefit of the engineer's unique perspective on policy issues. This paper identifies specific areas of public policy often encountered by engineers and discusses policy development processes that would be greatly enriched by increased participation from the engineering community. In addition, the paper identifies ways in which undergraduate and graduate engineering programs can prepare engineers to be more effective practitioners and better serve their clients, their employers, and their profession in the political, legal and administrative environments.},

In order to study the problem-solving styles of engineering and management students and to track intra-team interactions, the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory (KAI) was used to determine the cognitive styles of the students in Bucknell's Institute for Leadership in Technology and Management (ILTM) during the summer of 2001. The KAI scores were then utilized to interpret and characterize data collected through journaling assignments in which the students recorded their observations about the abilities of project team members to work and communicate with each other. Results show that KAI scores correlate well with both positive and negative aspects of project team experiences.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to propose an information system application to manage the quality of service in an educational environment. Information systems support management by providing storage of captured data relevant in describing the process and in measuring the effectiveness of its results; manipulation of such data and reporting of variances between actual and expected performance; and often, particularly with decision-support or knowledge-based systems, recommendations for improvements to alleviate or minimize those variances. Service quality is generally identified as the measure of success of an organization's endeavors to provide the service requested by its clients. The client receiving the service defines this success. The problem with this perspective is that metrics are rarely directly measurable, relevant for the processes involved in the operation, clearly understood by the clients, or applicable for all clients. Additionally, in education, the client does not see the full results until several years after graduation. To address these problems, we have adopted and applied a systematic approach to the analysis of the undergraduate industrial engineering process and the design of an information system to manage the process to ensure service quality. The purpose of this study is to provide academic units with an objective assessment of their capabilities, processes and service delivery, and a clear measurement of their service performance within the confines of the expectations and needs of its stakeholders.},

abstract={Industrial engineering programs have typically adopted the new ABET accreditation criteria with more enthusiasm than other engineering programs, in part since the principles of continuous improvement and statistical measurement are commonly taught in most curriculums, and skills such as team work and data analysis are staples of modern IE curricula. However, such complementary skills should not limit the expertise that industrial engineers use to improve engineering programs. Mathematical models can be effective tools for both enhancing learning and assessment. This paper presents a number of modeling approaches that a team, consisting primarily of industrial engineers at the University of Pittsburgh has developed in conjunction with colleagues at the Colorado School of Mines over the course of several years to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to ABET's requirement of continuous improvement. Using both logistic regression analysis and various neural network algorithms, we have employed empirical modeling to successfully improve retention in engineering, predict probation during the first year, and determine proper placement in math courses. We are also in the early stages of developing similar models to determine a student's intellectual development, determine student achievement based on students' attitudes towards engineering and themselves, as well as predict various EC 2000 outcomes based on students' attitudes. We describe each of theses models separately in this paper to emphasize the need for modeling as a viable tool for evaluation in engineering education.},

abstract={Project Catalyst is an NSF-fimded initiative to promote systemic change in engineering education by utilizing proven instructional design techniques, transforming the classroom into an active learning environment, and incorporating the use of information technology in the teaching/learning process. In the first two years of Project Catalyst, a core group of faculty from all five engineering departments at Bucknell University has begun implementing this focused shift by systematically incorporating collaborative and problem-based learning into their courses. This emphasis has required a coordinated effort to introduce significant elements of team building and problem solving into the undergraduate curriculum. This paper discusses a conceptual framework for progressively developing students' problem solving and team skills across the curriculum. The framework is modeled after the university's writing program and identifies introductory, intermediate and advanced problem solving and team building courses that are staged through the undergraduate engineering programs. This staged framework provides a structure to guide faculty in selecting teaming and problem solving activities to be emphasized in a given course. To assist faculty in introducing appropriate teaming and problem solving activities, Project Catalyst has also developed instructional modules for faculty that focus on team building and problem solving at each level. These modules are course and curriculum independent and can be used in any course at other institutions. This paper will also describe preliminary assessment results of the curriculum structure.

abstract={The public and private sectors are demanding entry-level technical personnel that are well schooled in the fundamental principles of their respective engineering and technology disciplines. Both of these groups are placing a premium on graduates who have had significant design experiences and have participated in a team environment. Finally, these potential employers are demanding graduates that have the ability to communicate effectively in both written and verbal formats. These new hires will, in all likelihood, become members of project teams and participate as team members and eventually as project managers. The Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering Technology (EET/TET) Programs at Texas A&M University have established a mandatory technical project management course that is closely linked to its capstone senior design course. With assistance and participation from a number of large and small companies, EET/TET students now learn about the fundamentals of project management while they prepare for entry to their senior design project. The new course provides the opportunity for students to form teams, evaluate potential project opportunities, arrange for faculty and industry support and sponsorship, and prepare the written documentation and technical presentations that culminates in a formal technical proposal. Using the Project Management Institute (PMT) Body of Knowledge, the students plan the work they will accomplish in their capstone senior design course.},

abstract={The Greenfield Coalition (GC) located at the Focus:HOPE Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT) and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) offers a Manufacturing Engineering Program that integrates academic work with manufacturing skills learned in the workplace. Engineering Economics has been designed as an eight-module, three-credit course. The first seven modules present the basic fundamentals necessary to make investment decisions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the eighth module, which requires students to demonstrate their understanding of the principles on a real life engineering investment analysis case study. The case study deals with the manufacturing of pulleys involved in the balancing operation of machine components. Because of some malfunctioning in the balancing operation, the manufacturer is faced with a high percentage of scrap. The analysis involves the identification and evaluation of alternate strategies for meeting a projected market demand, as specified in probabilistic terms, leading to the recommendation of a specific strategy. A decision tree was developed depicting various alternatives along with their respective returns. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is presented to demonstrate the possible impact of changes in crucial variables on the final recommendations. The case study is web-enabled, providing the learner a virtual environment in which to explore many resources impacting investment decisions. Resources include: scrap reports, pricing data, process charts, interviews with key production and engineering personnel, among many others. Learners must sort through these data, define the problem, and propose a solution which is supported by a financial analysis.},

abstract={The Summer Fellowship Program (SFP) under the management of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) offers opportunity to participate in NASA's current research efforts. The SFP during the summers of 2000/01 offered educational benefits of microstrip antenna design experience and space technology. The projects provided educators research experience and enrich knowledge in two areas of undergraduate teaching, including Electromagnetics and General Physics. In the area of Electromagnetics, learning the CAD process of antenna design using Ansoft Ensemble, including its strength and limitations, enabled educators to carry those skills back to students in the classroom.},

abstract={In an integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing company, the workforce has many skill and education levels but everyone has to work together and communicate effectively on complex technology issues. The microelectronics technology curriculum at ASU has therefore taken on the same challenge - to present a common set of device and process concepts to classes at different educational levels in an integrated teaching factory environment. This experiment in education delivery has the familiar broad range of parameters students from diverse backgrounds, several degree levels and the gamut of content treatments that constitute technology. We present conclusions from many of the delivery combinations. Our experience is that we can indeed manage common concepts at many degree levels in an integrated environment. The biggest obstacles are concerned with student communication skills, their management of ambiguity, numerical fluency and troubleshooting.},

abstract={The Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT) program at James Madison University has developed an innovative, interdisciplinary course sequence that introduces the theory and practice of modern production to undergraduates in science and technology. The sequence stresses "information age" manufacturing, which capitalizes on computing and information technology as a tool for increasing labor productivity and enhancing competitiveness. Successfully blending engineering, business, science and information technology, the courses provide a balanced contemporary treatment of manufacturing resource management, design and manufacturing systems, and materials and manufacturing processes. Several laboratory modules and group projects offered throughout the sequence provide opportunities for experiential learning, hand-on experience and teamwork. The sequence addresses many of the critical competency gaps in manufacturing engineering education reported in recent national surveys of manufacturing managers and practitioners.},

abstract={In many ways graduate engineering education has served the U.S. well. But there is now broad recognition that it must change substantially to meet new challenges of the 21 st Century. A noticeable decline in the number of domestic graduate students pursuing engineering has occurred and just under half of those who are pursuing the doctorate are foreign nationals. But the drop in Americans engaging in graduate studies in engineering is also being perceived by industry and by a growing proportion of graduate schools as a reflection of a lack of opportunity for lifelong learning and of an insufficiency of U.S. graduate education to serve the full professional spectrum of engineering. This deficiency is affecting U.S. competitiveness and the nation's long-term capacity for innovation. The ASEE-Graduate Studies Division has established a National Collaborative to address the compelling issues for needed reform to improve more relevant engineering graduate education for the engineering workforce in industry as a complement to research-based graduate education. This paper describes the conceptual basis and impact of this reform and a call-for-action is submitted to promote this activity to improve U.S. competitiveness.},

abstract={The benefits of company sponsored student design projects, both to academia and to industry, have been well established recently in symposia and in publications. However, assessing these benefits in order to improve the students' experiences can be difficult. This paper discusses techniques of assessment used to improve student learning over the past five years in capstone design courses at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. The student teams work together to create solutions to design problems defined by companies. These projects are "owned and managed" by the student teams with company contacts providing appropriate data and information and with faculty serving as advisors only. Mistakes made by the teams therefore are sometimes inevitable but this is considered to be pedagogically an important lesson in design. The students must interact not only with their company but also with their team mates in order to accomplish team goals. The assessment of these important interactions and the resulting changes to the courses are discussed. Traditionally, design reports alone have been the method by which the students' performance is judged in typical capstone design courses. However, this limits the ability of the faculty to determine the students' interaction with their companies and also with their peers. The desire to evaluate teaming skills as well as technical competence led the authors to investigate different approaches for assessing student learning. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the use of company evaluations, status reports, student self-assessments, peer reviews, and oral reports, as well as design reports to quantify student performance both as team members and design engineers. These methods will be discussed and examples presented showing how the results can be used to improve individual student performance on industrial design projects.},

The theoretical part of the course provides a general understanding of the behavior of the materials commonly used in manufacturing, the basic techniques used in processing them into useful products, the scientific theory underlying those processes, and the criteria for selecting particular processes. The laboratory portion involves team projects that help students gain hands-on experience with selected manufacturing processes. The projects start with simple components that can be made on a single machine such as a lathe or a mill, and progress to the manufacture and assembly of a fully operational model engine. This approach introduces students to the issues involved in putting together a non-trivial assembly. The projects also expose students to the idea of working in teams, a skill that is highly sought by industry.},

abstract={This paper compares Civil Engineering Education curriculum at the University of Florida (UF) with the National University of Science and Technology (NUST), Pakistan. A review of courses from each school is presented to understand the Civil Engineering curriculum structure at two institutions. Each school aims at disseminating the most effective engineering education, by coordinating technological/scientific areas of national, economical and social interests of the country. Civil Engineering education at UF primarily focuses on technical excellence, communication skills, and a well-rounded general and interdisciplinary education. In comparison, NUST focuses on balanced distribution of theoretical knowledge, practical and fieldwork to address real life civil engineering projects. The major curriculum of each school differs based on their socio-economical characteristics, national and industrial needs, and the availability of natural resources. Although the overall curriculum structure may appear different but the basic underlying objective of academic syllabus is the same. This common objective is basically the result of increasing global nature of Civil Engineering education. Undoubtedly, the future of Civil Engineering education strives on the balance of ideas from global perspectives. Thus concluding the paper, it aims at promoting, stimulating and broadening the dialogue among the engineering students, engineering faculty and university administration to develop additional curricular mechanisms through which the two universities can produce the next generation of Civil Engineering graduates.},

abstract={During the summer of 2001, a team of students was brought together to design, install, and test an 802.11b wireless local area network (WLAN). The team was tasked with installing a WLAN in and between two buildings on the Texas A&M main campus that house the Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution Department (ETID). The primary goal of the WLAN installation was to provide an infrastructure that would be used by Engineering Technology students and faculty for educational and research purposes. The Wireless Infrastructure Project (WIP) became a real world classroom/laboratory environment for the team members to learn about wireless communications, networking, and authorization and authentication security and to gain practical experience in project management, technical communications and presentation skills. Additionally, the Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering Technology Program is developing innovative ways to leverage the new infrastructure that depart from traditional administrative uses. Professors and students are developing coursework that utilize the infrastructure for the monitoring and control of mobile platforms while WIP students are adding new labs that expand the scope of teaching wireless network design and security. Through the WIP initiative, an innovative resource has been created that will add significantly to engineering technology education both in the classroom and the laboratory.},

abstract={The Purdue Aviation Technology Department developed an introductory aviation course for students participating in the six weeks Upward Bound rising sophomore program. Upward Bound is a pre-college preparatory program providing academic support, personal counseling and cultural enrichment for eligible low income and potential first-generation college participants in the East Chicago, Gary, Hammond, and the Lake Station target area. The goal of the introductory aviation course was to interest young people in the aviation industry, which is traditionally underrepresented by minorities. The students were exposed to all three components of the Aviation Program: Flight training, maintenance technology and business management. They were introduced to aerodynamics, propulsion, airframe structures and aircraft systems. A qualified pilot taught them the basics of flying a B-727 full motion flight simulator, and they made a flight in a light aircraft. As a final hands-on project the students built an aluminum winglet section. Last summer the faculty organized field trips to a major air carrier maintenance facility and an Air Force museum. The authors will discuss in this paper the unique challenges of developing a curriculum that attracts young minority students and the teaching strategies to overcome the cultural differences between minority students and faculty.},

The primary intent of Tufts' outreach program centered on introducing graduate-level engineering students as resources to assist classroom teachers in implementing activity and constructivist based engineering curricula. Massachusetts is the first state in the nation to require engineering education at all levels in public schools, through the adoption of Science and Technology/Engineering frameworks; as a result, the need to develop specific curricula in support of these new frameworks is particularly important. This NSF grant facilitated direct graduate student support of teachers recently charged with implementing novel educational frameworks involving engineering, as well as indirect undergraduate student support.},

abstract={The key to the strength of the U.S. economy has been industry's ability to capitalize on technological innovation. At American research universities, an inherent objective of Ph.D. programs in engineering is innovation related to new or existing technologies. Despite such an obvious mutuality of interest, industry has typically not looked to universities to fulfill its applied research needs. This paper examines some of the reasons behind this condition, including the continued emphasis some universities place on traditional Ph.D. programs that are geared to the preparation of students for faculty positions rather than entry into industrial careers. The economic downturn has forced industry to cut back on internal R&D expenditures, making it even more important to find ways of encouraging industry to partner with academe to help meet the continuing need for technological innovation. This paper focuses on some new developments in engineering doctoral education that meet this need while continuing to satisfy academic program requirements. The new approach calls for a systemic change that will couple the resources of research universities and industry in a cooperative effort to produce the technological innovation that supports the continued growth of the economy.},

abstract={Based on a survey completed by 280 alumni during academic year 2000-2001, the following observations can be made: The top four indicators that a person is staying current professionally and technically were: 1. Reading trade or professional journals 2. Attending technical/training seminars or short courses 3. Attending professional conferences 4. Earning an advanced degree. The four most frequent responses to how alumni could have been better prepared by their undergraduate experience were: 1. Changes in content of engineering courses; e.g. more industry interaction, real-world context, and current technology and software 2. More involvement in professional organizations 3. Increased use of trade and professional publications in the curriculum 4. Increased focus on professional skill; e.g. communication, ethics, conflict resolution, teamwork and time management. By far the most significant response to barriers to staying current was "time". Breaking down the response further, it is apparent that significant elements dealt with balance of personal and professional time commitments and employer allocation of time and resources towards professional development. It seemed to be a commonly accepted expectation of alumni and alumni of their employers that professional development is to be accomplished outside of normal work hours, from personal time. Lack of motivation or willingness to learn and change was observed to also be a significant barrier.},

abstract={3D printing is a rapid prototyping process which creates a part layer by layer by spraying a binder into a bed of powder. This process is used in industry to produce concept models for marketing, fit, form and function models, as well as patterns for molds. A team of Mechanical Engineering Technology students at Perm State Erie, working on a senior project to test the down force on a late model dirt stock car, has integrated the use of rapid prototyping into their project in an innovative way. The project called for the students to build a model of the car, and to conduct wind tunnel tests to determine the down force that is generated. This student team decided to use the 3D printed prototype directly in a wind tunnel, since it appeared to be a quick, relatively inexpensive method for providing test results. Several problems arose during the design and manufacture of the model. One of the main concerns was the strength of the part, since the model contains several thin sections which would have to both survive the build process and withstand the force of the wind. Other issues included the amount of detail needed in the model, model size, and design of the model to allow for simple, economic changes. This paper reports on these issues, and how they were resolved.},

abstract={Student design projects are very useful for practically bringing student knowledge areas to bear, for giving students open ended, creative experiences, in developing team skills and for enhancing communication abilities. Management of these projects through sound project management principles can help expand the range of experiences, as well as simply help keep projects on track. Project management is performed to some extent on many projects in many schools, as a survey in this paper of publications indicates, with mixed results being experienced. The paper then focuses on an extensive application of project management techniques to capstone design courses involving engineering technology students and to other student design projects (e.g. SAE Mini Baja) at Penn State Altoona, through involvement by business school faculty and students. Future plans, lessons learned and student perceptions are discussed and recommendations made.},

abstract={The selection of appropriate reuse, recycling and disposal options for biosolids requires an understanding of many factors including the physical and chemical properties of the biosolid, risks posed to potential receptors and applicable regulatory requirements. These options continue to evolve due to new technologies and changes in regulatory requirements. Many "new" options for biosolid reuse and recycling have met regulatory acceptance due to pressures from limited landfill space and advances in risk assessment. This paper is a presentation of how current research in biosolid characterization and biosolid management are being integrated into selected courses in Wentworth's undergraduate environmental engineering program. With participation from the Biosolids industry, lecture material, laboratory studies and a Capstone Design project have been developed. The lecture and laboratory studies have focussed on assessing risks posed by the presence of trace levels of organic chemicals. Trace level organic compounds, including 4-methyl phenol, have presented regulatory issues with municipal and industry generators of biosolids. Students have investigated the natural and anthropogenic sources of these organic compounds in biosolid matrices. The Capstone Design project involves the design of a pulp and paper/municipal biosolid blend for use as topsoil at a local quarry that is being developed into a municipal golf course. Critical issues in this design concern nitrate leaching and slope stabilization. The paper also provides a review of resources that may be used by environmental engineering educators for the development of teaching modules in other topic areas involving biosolids.},

This paper reviews and discusses the events and experiences associated with the development and initial conduct of this sequence of C++ programming courses. It details how the courses were designed to assist ET students to better succeed in higher level courses taken later in their program sequence. Foundation elements of these courses include C++ procedural and object oriented grammar and syntax, programming structures and data structures. The paper illustrates how secondary elements of a technical programming course can be selected so as to additionally promote and encourage student learning of techniques for applied technical problem solving, technical writing, software engineering, project management, team dynamics and ethics.},

abstract={As the demand for engineers continues to grow it is necessary to educate young students in technology and science related careers. This challenges educators to make engineering exciting and interesting. The following briefly details the implementation of a youth-development program that is committed to preparing the engineers of tomorrow. The non-profit organization For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST™) has created FIRST™ LEGO® League to encourage and equip students ages nine to fourteen to pursue careers in engineering and technology fields. Through this program, FIRST™ hopes to develop the qualities of teamwork, cooperation, creativity, problem solving, sportsmanship, confidence, communication, and leadership in middle-school youth across the nation. The only roadblock in the proliferation of the program is the apprehension of schools and civic organizations to commit to the activity considering their involvements in a variety of other activities. Since the start of this program at Ames Middle School, each of the seventeen participants has been successful in building the skills they need to become the engineers of the future. Participating on the FIRST™ LEGO League teams has helped these students develop problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, interpersonal skills, personal responsibility, time management, and creativity. Individuals have also gained a better understanding of engineering, as well as achieving new confidence levels, interests, and involvement in science and math. Many of these skills will be invaluable to the students regardless of what career path they take; however, the activities and experiences are enticing their appetites for engineering and technology, creating engineers for the future.},

abstract={There is an increased demand for graduates who understand how energy is created, used, controlled, and wasted in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. Students in Electrical Engineering Technology learn electrical power generation, distribution, and control while students from Mechanical Engineering Technology learn how other forms of energy are generated, distributed, and controlled. Both groups learn engineering economics principles. The missing component is to bring these three fields together while integrating other developing technologies to solve the challenges in the field of energy management. This paper discusses how the engineering technology programs can contribute in this endeavor. The topics include 1) what skills are required by today's energy professionals, 2) what subordinate skills are needed, 3) how energy audits can be used as cost effective hands-on experiences, 4) a list of equipment for energy audits, and 5) potential of applied research and outreach opportunities.},

abstract={The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has adopted a revised set of criteria for accrediting engineering programs. Nevertheless, as in the past, civil (construction) engineering departments will be required to demonstrate proficiency in specific subject areas which are included in the ABET program criteria. This paper investigates, according to civil engineering and construction related students, the level at which their understanding of various subject areas required by ABET has been enhanced by attendance at and/or participation in class field trips in addition to lectures and seminars presented by practicing professional engineers. In particular, the findings suggest that both undergraduate and graduate students believe that three areas have been greatly enhanced with this activity. They include environmental engineering, project management/scheduling and estimating, and team work. In addition, undergraduates perceive that their understanding of health and safety issues, and ethical considerations has also been increased at a high percentage. In contrast, graduate students believe that their knowledge of hydraulics/hydrology/water resources and geotechnical engineering has been enhanced, but at a lower rate, by interaction with practitioners.},

abstract={Many students enter college lacking basic problem solving and communication skills. The situation is even more exacerbated for students from urban high schools. We have disseminated a "computing and composition" approach, originally implemented in firstyear college programming and English composition courses, to a high school curriculum in an urban setting. The Computing and Composition Project served students attending four Newark, New Jersey high schools, each serving populations with different profiles of academic performance. The instructional program included the development of a series of case studies based on the state high school science and mathematics content standards and the specific curriculum in place at the schools. These learning modules were designed to emphasize the skills required to solve problems and learn the syntax of the C++ programming language. Teamwork was an important part of this project. An important component of the instructional method included a problem solving and program development process to assist beginning computer science students fulfill the complex, multiple tasks of programming. After working through the process, students will have produced a carefully designed and fully documented solution to a problem. In the composition component, the writing process was the basic procedure through which students gain skills in and an understanding of what is necessary to produce effective expository prose written to respond to specific problems. Measurements of success and problem areas in the implementation of this program will be presented and methods for overcoming obstacles in such programs suggested.},

abstract={Most engineering graduates pursue positions in existing businesses. Generally, for an individual to advance in a business firm, it is required that he/she focus on the central purpose of the firm; this most often is maximizing shareholder equity. As has been widely quoted, the business of business is business. Leaders of technology-based firms should have technical competence and business savvy. There have been notable cases of engineers who have risen to the top of major corporations. In recent history, Jack Welch, Andy Grove and Lou Gerstner are widely known as engineers who have leveraged their technical capabilities while also clearly succeeding in business. There are unfortunately many more counterexamples of engineers who have entered corporations with strong technical capabilities and interest in promotion within the corporation, but who have failed to advance as a result of shortcomings in their business skills and sophistication. This paper describes an ongoing collaborative effort between the Colleges of Engineering and Business at the University of Texas at Austin to create a business short-course for engineering students to familiarize them with business concepts. The objective is not to teach the students all they will ever need to know about business, but instead to teach them the importance of understanding the business implications of technology transfer in commercial ventures. To accomplish these goals in a two week short-course, the faculty members involved are packaging a set of electronic business tutorials of relevance to engineering students. The two week short course culminates in a simulation where the students start a business and run it over several years with the objective of maximizing shareholder equity. The details of implementing this collaborative program are provided in this manuscript.},

abstract={Project Lead The Way (PLTW) is a national program that offers a pre-engineering curriculum for high schools and middle schools. The high school curriculum consists of five courses covering solid modeling with a CAD package, digital electronics, principles of engineering, computer integrated manufacturing, and implementation of a design project. Teachers learn the technical, project-based course material in an intensive, two-week summer training session at the PLTW Summer Training Center at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) or at one of the six National Training Affiliates. Nearly 300 high schools and middle schools across the country are affiliated with PLTW. This report discusses the Project Lead The Way program nationally as well as its implementation in Indiana. This paper gives a brief description of the five courses in the high school curriculum and the gateway course in the middle school curriculum. These courses emphasize hands-on, project-oriented learning. This paper also tells how PLTW, the Indiana Department of Education, Purdue University, RIT, and affiliate schools in the state have come together to implement this program in Indiana.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the issues facing the department head that relate to the emergence and management of a highly successful distance-learning program in an engineering technology department. Should your engineering technology unit develop distance learning courses, certificates, and degrees? If so, how can the ET department head motivate faculty to become involved? How is the development of course materials funded? How are faculty compensated? What about training, software and hardware resources? What expertise is needed? How can both faculty and administrators balance on-campus and online courses with respect to faculty workload? What are the issues related to assessment and accreditation? Specific answers to these questions and others are provided as they apply to The University of Toledo's highly successful degree-completion program, a program which uses web-based courses to provide place-bound community college EET graduates access to its bachelor of science degree in Computer Science and Engineering Technology (CSET). This paper is not about the many issues related to teaching an effective distance learning class, rather it is about how to start, grow, and manage a distance-learning program in an engineering technology department with limited departmental and institutional resources.},

abstract={The Engineering Technology Program at Old Dominion University offers ABET accredited options in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Technology. In recent years this offering has been expanded to include emphasis areas such as Surveying/Geomatics, Computer Engineering Technology and Nuclear Engineering Technology, under the umbrella of the three original programs. Old Dominion University requires students to meet their Upper Division General Education Requirements with a minor, a cluster (advanced study in a focus area) or a second major. In assessing the needs of students for workplace success, the department Industrial Advisory Board, strongly suggested incorporation of course content in the areas of business and management. Within the College of Engineering and Technology, the Department of Engineering Management offers only graduate degrees, but supports other departments with courses at the undergraduate level. The Civil Engineering Technology program collaborated with the Engineering Management department to include courses in the curriculum that incorporate a minor in Engineering Management that addresses the concepts identified by the advisory group. This paper discusses the workplace need this direction addresses, the influence the change has made on the curriculum and the advantages following graduation that students experience.},

This integrated approach uses modular materials jointly developed with secondary and community college faculty to provide a framework that may be used as needed to replace or augment existing course curricula focused on problem solving issues. The available materials in the Problem Solving Module are divided into seven primary sections. Each section provides sample lesson plans and suggestions to teachers on use tactics, lecture material, student worksheets, assessment tools, high technology examples, and video examples using computer-based animations. The materials are at present being tested in high school math, science, chemistry and physics courses as well as in community college chemistry courses.

abstract={The Introduction to Materials course at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis (IUPUI), is notorious for its laboratory experiments and report procedures. The course is in the Mechanical Engineering Technology department of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology and identified as MET 141. This is one of the very first courses that entering freshman take, usually in the first semester, and one with generally large enrollments for a laboratory-based course. Much of the effort spent on this course is in the way of repeatedly explaining experimental procedures to several small groups, identifying the various equipment and how it is used, and going over the expectations of the laboratory report format and content. The previous method of conveying this information to the students was by the instructor and a laboratory manual with procedural instructions. The difficulty with this delivery method is that the students are not familiar with the equipment so the procedures mean very little to them. This often results in more confusion. In an effort to be more efficient and to present the laboratory information in a way that is more beneficial to the students, the idea of enhancing the lab manual was being considered. A Computer Graphics Technology (CGT) Instructor and a Senior Design student presented the perfect solution to the problem. Why not create a multimedia laboratory supplement that combines audio, video, text, and more that the students can utilize for the course? The next several months involved considerable amounts of effort to compile all the necessary information, produce the video, add the audio and text, and then organize everything into a suitable format. The result of this effort is a CD-ROM and laboratory manual combination that is currently being tested on a limited basis and will be tested in full scale in the fall of 2002.},

abstract={This paper outlines practices that ensure quality in administering, interpreting, reporting, and maintaining the 'Design Team Readiness Assessment' developed by the Transferable Integrated Design Engineering Education (TIDEE) consortium in the Pacific Northwest. A copy of the instrument can be downloaded from www.cea.wsu.edu/tidee. The instrument assesses design process, teamwork, and design communication skills in three different contexts. Previous work has demonstrated how to achieve high inter-rater reliability through explicit scoring criteria and decision rules. For this reason, the 'Design Team Readiness Assessment' can be used to evaluate the preparation of beginning and mid-level engineering and engineering technology students across institutions and degree programs. Faculty who have implemented the instrument have found it to be a valuable classroom tool, promoting self-awareness of life-long learning skills in a variety of course settings and supporting action research on lower-division design experiences. Their discoveries are summarized here using a framework for assessment literacy that is widely used in the K-12 education community.},

abstract={Capstone courses offered in most construction engineering programs are designed to pull together much of what the student has already learned in previous courses. This will enable the student to gain an appreciation of how the different aspects of a construction project come together. The course is not an in depth study of any one function or technical aspect, but rather a synergistic overview of the project process. Penn State Harrisburg's Structural Design & Construction Engineering Technology (SDCET) capstone course is separated into two sections so students can focus in either structural design or construction management. The sections stress their specialized area while still integrating elements of the other area. The four credit-hour course begins in the last seven and one-half weeks of the fall semester for one credit, and continues in the spring for three credits. The fall syllabus for the construction management option includes teams of students each forming a firm, dealing with organizational structures and personnel responsibilities, a marketing plan, company portfolio and potential client interview. The course continues in the spring with pre-qualifications, financial statements, RFP for CM services, project planning, bid packages and bidding, scheduling (bid and construction), value engineering, safety policy, and other CM services. Industry presentations and involvement provide the course with real world experiences. The course also integrates written and oral communications throughout to stress the importance of these skills for a successful manager.},

It was found using a bootstrap sample, at a significance level of 0.05, that the grade point average (GPA) of students working on projects in collaboration with industry administered through a variety of tools over the Internet (Experimental Group) was higher than those receiving only traditional classroom style lecture (Control Group). Overall, we conclude that the Internet is an effective and efficient medium for incorporating industry based projects into the curriculum, leading to greater student proficiency with course material and the fundamental concepts of Engineering Economy as applied to the real world. Conclusions and future plans are also provided.},

abstract={In this paper an alternate approach to analyzing structures using MATLAB software is discussed. The procedure is to be implemented in teaching a structural analysis course offered in the Civil Engineering Technology Program at Georgia Southern University in the fall semester of 2002. A series of carefully selected set of problems are designed to familiarize the students to the MATLAB programming tools needed to analyze statically determinate as well as indeterminate structures. The problems designed for this project cover a number of major topics typically discussed in an introductory level structural analysis course such as equilibrium, shear and moment diagrams, and deflections. By performing the exercises selected for this course, the students learn how to utilize MATLAB to perform a variety of tasks related to analyzing structures. These tasks can involve activities such as determining the reactions in a simple statically determinate beam using static equilibrium considerations, or analyzing a more complicated indeterminate frame using the method of slope-deflection. The procedure implemented in this project arms the students with a powerful computational tool they could utilize to verify the accuracy of their developed hand-solutions. This project also helps the students to gain a more in-depth understanding of the structural concepts, since this knowledge is needed in writing MATLAB script files. By performing the exercises designed for this course, the students acquire a better appreciation for the power of computers and their application to solve structural analysis problems. Included in this paper are examples to illustrate the procedure described.},

abstract={At the University of Hartford, we have developed a "Capstone Design Experience" in an effort to improve our Architectural Engineering Technology curriculum. By increasing the awareness of the interrelationships between different areas of study, we are attempting to strike a new balance. We have integrated the following into a single yearlong design project: research, programming, planning, history and theory, design, model making, drawing, CAD, structures, environmental systems, presentations and writing. Our capstone program provides opportunities for exploration, questioning, testing, and criticism. It requires the students to use experience and knowledge gained in other courses and forces them to play an active role in their own learning. It demands personal accountability for decisions, and commitment to ideas and proposals that are scrutinized publicly. We believe that we have developed a model that other disciplines on campus could well profit from observing.},

abstract={Public Works and Infrastructure is a pervasive part of every aspect of urbanized life, and increasingly impacts the human and nature. The scale of infrastructure systems in the United States continues to increase, along with the number of institutions involved in planning and management of the infrastructure. Understanding the societal needs, the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida has a separate graduate program, for almost a decade, in Public Works Engineering and Management, one of its kind in the State of Florida, to foster leading edge research in the field of Public Works and Infrastructure Management. The curriculum includes a flexible and wide range of subjects that relate to the facilities managed by Public Works agencies. They include streets, parks, public buildings, highways, water and wastewater management systems and virtually any other asset owned by a Governmental agency. Furthermore, this need extends beyond traditional topics to an examination of customer service, ethics, use of technology, environmental responsibilities, and legal requirements. The responsibilities of the public works manager are becoming increasingly diverse. This paper explores the role of Public Works as an integral part of the society in incorporating entrepreneur skills to graduate students. This paper also details the Graduate Public Works Division at the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering, University of Florida and various courses offered under the graduate program.},

abstract={This paper contributes to the perception of the future engineer and the competencies needed. Besides a good basic knowledge of engineering, business, technology and management our students need training in softer skills such as international cooperation, collaboration, communication, teambuilding and teamwork, language and understanding of other cultures, their behaviour, costumes, habits and expectations. The Chinese saying: "Ru xiang sui su" meaning "Enter village and follow costume" tells it all. The future engineer must be able to work in international project groups with multidisciplinary and cross-cultural participation. In the European Project Semester, EPS, described in this paper, students are exposed to a multi-cultural environment in which they study and work together on real projects provided by industry. Here new learning and teaching methods and competencies are introduced and are not just an opportunity to practice what has been previously taught. Normally students from 10-12 different universities in EU, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and Lithuania participate. Also universities in Chile and the US are now sending their students to join. EPS contributes to international understanding and competitiveness.},

abstract={The current trend of state departments of transportation is to require the utilization of third party design software in the production of design drawings for state funded highway projects. This has led to the need to introduce the use of this type of software in design classes in Construction and Civil Technology programs. The University of Toledo Construction Engineering Technology program integrated GEOPAK into synchronized CAD laboratory projects within a course that included highway geometric design as well as site and utility layout and design. This course was found to foster the ability of students to become sufficiently comfortable with the software, allowing them to take the next step in becoming fully productive with its use. Although it is far from a complete understanding of the workings of the software, students are taught how use GEOPAK to create existing and proposed digital terrain models, cut profiles and produce horizontal and vertical roadway alignments, while producing finished plan sets. Students were found to be appreciative of the delivery system of the class. It offered realistic periodic progress submittals during the development of a semester long project which required the use of GEOPAK to aid in the design. While the students expressed the feeling of being a bit overwhelmed with the additional complexities of GEOPAK, most found that they gained an appreciation for the capabilities of available software technology and its utilization as a time saving tool in the production of construction documents.},

abstract={Old Dominion University (ODU) has offered Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering technology for over 30 years. The programs in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Technology have maintained continuous accreditation by TAC of ABET since 1976. These programs have been delivered via ODU's interactive video TELETECHNET system to distance learning students in Virginia and other selected sites for more than 10 years. In 1999, the Department of Engineering Technology saw a need to develop a General Engineering Technology (GET) program to provide educational opportunities to students with a wide variety of educational and work backgrounds. The availability of this program and communications with the U. S. Department of the Navy resulted in the formulation of an asynchronous CD-ROM based General Engineering Technology program under the auspices of the Navy College Rating Partnership program. ODU is partnered with other institutions to provide the program to personnel located aboard ships and at other facilities. Naval experience and schooling are used extensively to satisfy some of the lower-division technical credits. The upper-division courses will be offered on CD-ROM, with both audio and video. The program has an Electro-Mechanical orientation, and along with the major in General Engineering Technology, a graduate will earn a minor in Engineering Management. A description of the program is provided within this paper. Some of the problems encountered and possible solutions will be described. The program is believed to offer significant educational opportunities for Naval personnel in many technical ratings.},

abstract={The paper presents results of an action research project, which took place between January and April 2001, and examined how differences in prior academic achievement of students and in their learning styles affected learning outcomes. All students received hypermedia instruction. The results show that hypermedia allowed previously lower-achieving students to improve their academic performance and therefore reduce the gap between them and their higher-achieving peers. The findings suggest that reducing the gap was a result of hypermedia instruction moderating differences in achievement between students with different learning modalities and accommodating a wider range of learning styles than conventional instruction. These findings were consistent with the previous 2000 study and with the 1999 pilot project, where students in the experimental group received hypermedia instruction, and their achievement was compared with the achievement of conventionally instructed students in the control group. Course website access patterns and a survey of student attitudes towards hypermedia instruction are also discussed.

abstract={In February 1999, the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT initiated a new three-semester capstone laboratory and space systems design experience taught in the context of authentic engineering practice, i.e., Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate (CDIO). The objective of CDIO is to teach the basic concepts and disciplines of engineering in the context of hands-on exercises where students have the opportunity to manipulate concrete objects and ground abstract thought in experience. At the capstone level, a CDIO approach immerses students in all aspects of the lifecycle development of an engineering product, exposing them to important aspects of systems engineering not always experienced in conventional laboratory and design courses. A three-semester course sequence allowed students to develop a concept for a satellite formation flight laboratory for the International Space Station, build a high-fidelity prototype, and operate it for short periods of micro-gravity on NASA's KC-135. In addition, students experienced stages in the evolution of an aerospace product. This paper details this three-semester sequence, describes the project in the context of the learning experience, provides an assessment of the educational innovation, and suggests future modifications of the concept. The current capstone experience will also be described briefly. Overall, the first capstone experience was quite successful: a highly motivating project, a cohesive team of students, and a product that is being used nationally to advance space technology.},

The summer internships were developed to decrease the demand on faculty advisors of industry related senior design projects, and to fulfill the need of industry for completing entry-level engineering tasks while at the same time enabling them to evaluate a student for full-time employment upon graduation. The student in turn receives three academic credits in an industry related senior capstone experience, and in certain instances, has an opportunity to graduate a semester early.},

The team addressed public accessibility to an American Revolutionary War outpost through construction of timber bridges to carry a trail across an intermittent stream and a particularly steep, rocky slope. The site is located on the island directly across from West Point. A detailed description of the bridge project sets the stage for presentation of the key educational benefits gained by the students who completed it. Student assessment data demonstrates that such projects contribute much, not only to students' learning, but to student's motivation and self-awareness as well. A design-build project in an austere environment forces the students to develop resourcefulness, perseverance, adaptability, and creativity. This project was within the capabilities of senior civil engineering students and represented a unique opportunity for a culminating design experience incorporating real-world considerations of health and safety, constructability, usability/sustainability, historical and environmental sensitivity, economics, political, social, ethical, and aesthetics.},

abstract={Given the ever-expanding technical requirements for producing a proficient bachelor of civil engineering, departments need to develop innovative courses that incorporate aspects of many civil disciplines not otherwise covered within the curriculum. Students are not often asked to consider design, construction, architectural, material, and economic issues in combination, yet they must be proficient at handling these issues in order to be successful in their professional careers. In the spring semester of 2000 the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Villanova University initiated a structural engineering capstone design course that brings to focus the role of structural engineers in a global context, highlighted by structural design and construction in a third world country. The initial project involved the design and construction of a 25 foot tall reinforced concrete cross for a Catholic orphanage in Posas Verdes, Honduras. The project was challenging due to many constraints and limitations such as time, third world conditions, communication, material quality and availability, and other construction issues. Presented herein is a description of the cross project, the course format, and the associated engineering and construction challenges.},

This type of innovative approach for allowing students to become involved in realistic open-ended design problems is beneficial for enhancing their problem solving skills and encourages them to pursue graduate studies. The engineering clinics emphasize multidisciplinary design on projects of progressive complexity. This paper focuses on the design and development of experiments to illustrate membrane technology for pollution prevention. A multidisciplinary student team conducted a thorough literature search and developed innovative membrane experiments to demonstrate pollution prevention. These experiments can be used by various disciplines in engineering such as environmental and chemical engineering.},

abstract={Design projects are encouraged and even required in most engineering technology programs. Design is and should be introduced at the earliest stages of the technology education; however, "real" design projects are rarely included in the student's education. Instead, fictitious and "sanitized" projects that fit the level of understanding and education of the student are assigned. Many times these projects are selected and written to allow completion in one semester. This paper will discuss design projects that undergraduate students have been involved in with industrial clients. The projects were "real world" because they were real problems that these clients had. They were not prior selected for the students and the project scope was not selected for completion in one semester. The paper discusses how these projects were obtained, the initiation of the projects, when the projects were begun and how they were conducted. Intellectual property issues can be extremely sensitive. Guidelines are given for the initiation of and conduction of projects so that all parties are protected sufficiently. A practicing patent attorney discusses the necessary intellectual property considerations for the student, university, and the client and provides a checklist of issues that need to be addressed.},

abstract={The need for energetic focus on workforce development is well documented. However, there is no clear road map on how community colleges and universities should collaborate to support these programs. This paper examines an innovative, new baccalaureate degree that provides a possible model for these efforts. Old Dominion University has developed an extensive distance learning system that includes 32 remote community college sites and a total of fourteen hospital, military, and industrial sites in several states. As an essential element of the program offerings in this system, the Department of Engineering Technology has traditionally offered TAC of ABET accredited options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Technology. Based on close collaboration with the community college system and industry participants it became clear that there was a large group of technology -oriented students who were not served by these programs. To address this issue, the General Engineering Technology option with a number of specialization areas has been developed. This degree program has been enthusiastically welcomed and appears to have great potential to improve the technology based workforce.},

abstract={The new world that is emerging brings to the education institutions the challenge of forming a new kind of professional: a professional with solid formation, who is capable to think global and acting locally. In a Country like Brazil it is very important to have engineers committed with science and technology research principally in biomedical field, because despite of all problems of policy nature it has, it is a Country that medical and engineering fields are not behind any other, Country like USA and France for example. So it is possible to get good results in the proposal of university programs for these areas. With the goal to change the old orthodox pedagogy for engineering education the coordinating team of Engineering College of Lusiada University Center has conceived a different kind of engineering program. It is a five years program of Biomedical Engineering, which main characteristic is the inclusion of what has been named "Challenge Cycle". It consists in extra classes of peculiar areas of human knowledge, specially selected to make the students to develop their abilities of applying their skills in the global context with success. The courses last a period of four months each and the professionals are invited, some of them belong to the academic midst, others not and they are hired specially for this program. They are engineers with solid theoretical knowledge of management, economy and law and possessing great biomedical basis. At the end of the Biomedical Engineering Program the student will have a full formation in Electrical and Computer Engineering, which is necessary in according to the Education Law for third degree in Brazil.},

abstract={At Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden, a project course in embedded design is given for second year students of the Bachelor programs in Electrical/Computer Engineering. The assignment for the students is to specify and design an prototype control system for a mobile robot, currently a small car. The control system is based on a DSP (Digital Signal Processor). This course gives the students an opportunity to use and combine, in a practical way, the theoretical knowledge from earlier courses in electronics, microprocessors, automatic control, electrical measurements and programming. Working in a team-based project organization is also an important part of the course, as well as oral and written presentation techniques. The project is accomplished in teams of four students during a period of seven weeks. On the last day of the project there is a competition between the student teams in which the robot will race on a track with obstacles. The length of the competition track is 7 meters and the track has 5 to 7 randomly placed obstacles. The students have been very satisfied with this type of course. The design of the embedded system gives them a basic and useful understanding of sensors, electronics and a DSP. The course is given for 50 students, 3 times every year.},

abstract={For the past year, Oregon Institute of Technology's Civil Engineering and Communications Departments have been developing a creative curriculum venture: a unique senior design experience that would combine the content of what had previously been three distinct classes: engineering design, technical writing, and group dynamics. Students would work in teams on a real design project, and the nine faculty involved would also work as a team to provide a multidimensional educational experience. This paper describes the planning process, implementation, assessment methodology, challenges, and future plans. While this project certainly fulfills most of the EC2000 program outcomes criteria, our project vision extends further: to underscore the symbiotic relationship between engineering and communication and to afford students a realistic glimpse into their chosen profession.},

abstract={Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and the Berufsakademie Mannheim (BA-M), a cooperative education university located in Mannheim, Germany, have a unique student cooperative education exchange program that has served a total of forty IUPUI students and forty-eight BA-M students for the past 10 years. Sixty-eight percent of the students who have participated in the program have been engineering and technology students. The IUPUI exchange students spend approximately eight weeks working in a business or industry in Germany, while students from the BA-M do the same in the Indianapolis area. Work assignments and housing are arranged for the students by the hosting institution. The German students normally begin their exchange in mid January while the IUPUI students commence in mid-May. In most situations, all students are normally placed in a family home while participating in the program. This paper will provide a review of the program over the past decade from an IUPUI perspective. It will include all benefits, challenges, results, and rewards for the participating students, companies, and the institutions.},

abstract={Understanding the goals and constraints of other disciplines are key to working well in cross-disciplinary Problem-, Project-, Product-, Process-, People-Based Learning™ (P 5BL) teams. Education programs rarely offer learners opportunities to participate in authentic cross-disciplinary P 5BL experiences in a global teamwork e-Learning environment. This paper reports on models of mentoring in cross-disciplinary learning in Stanford University's P 5BL program. It addresses Architecture/Engineering/ Construction (A/E/C) industry's needs to broaden the competence of engineering students to exercise the acquired theoretical knowledge and understand the role of the discipline-specific knowledge in a multi-disciplinary P 5BL environment. In P 5BL undergraduate and graduate students play the roles of apprentice and journeyman, and faculty and industry practitioners play the role of "master builders" and mentors. An analysis of mentoring opportunities is presented within a situated perspective on learning, exploring theoretical constructs and practical implications of the development of communities of practice that reach beyond the university walls. The study presents an analysis of mentoring techniques in scaffolding students' cross disciplinary design process, as well as a description of students' rolls in scaffolding mentors understanding of cutting edge collaboration technologies in A/E/C. The paper discusses implications for the design of P 5BL environments, processes and implications for university and industry relationships.},

abstract={Recent advances in telecommunications and network technology, increasing demand for continuing education for industry professionals, and the general mobility and geographic distribution of the population are forcing major changes in both synchronous and asynchronous graduate education. This paper describes the author's experience in teaching a large section of a graduate-level computer engineering course with synchronous lectures to nine locations in Virginia and the numerous supporting mechanisms utilized for communications among students and with the instructor. Results of a survey conducted with all students in the class are analyzed here. We focus on students' experiences with working on a collaborative group research project involving group members in multiple locations. The author concludes that there is value in providing strong encouragement for student involvement across geographies; however, this is a process that will not typically occur naturally, so it requires both careful planning from the instructor and the appropriate set of tools to make active collaboration possible.},

abstract={The Aviation Management Capstone course (AMT 491) at Arizona State University East has been developed to provide students with an industry-centered educational experience during the final phase of their Bachelor of Science degree program. Students normally enroll for the Aeronautical Management Technology (AMT) Capstone course during the spring semester of their senior year. Each student is assigned as a member of a two or three-member team to work closely with an industry sponsor throughout the term. Students must coordinate their activities to address a significant and challenging issue facing the manager within the sponsor's organization. Each sponsor commits to a mentorship role for the student team(s) assigned to the organization, while at the same time, serving as the manager who is responsible for personnel performance within his/her department and/or division. The AMT Capstone course provides each student with real-world exposure to problems and issues faced by line and staff managers across a wide variety of aviation-oriented disciplines. Recently completed capstone team projects include: evaluations of current and pending Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and procedures for the Civil Aviation Security Field Office (CASFO), training requirements analyses for Mesa Airlines, marketing strategies for Williams Gateway Airport Authority, process improvement analyses for Honeywell, alternative fuels analyses for ground transportation serving Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), and gate expansion analyses for Southwest Airlines at PHX. Since the inception of the AMT Capstone course, 38 industry-sponsored projects have been completed for 16 different industry sponsors, with 10 more projects scheduled for the Spring 2001 semester. A description of selected capstone projects, with corresponding peer and project sponsor evaluations, are included in this paper.},

The objective of this session is to show sections of a professionally produced "Train the Trainer" videotape using students from Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Technology Programs working together on project teams to solve technical problems. This video will show the teaching methodology for collaborative learning including: writing specifications, brainstorming, solution evaluation, sketching, and testing of solutions. Students worked together as members of project teams to find solutions to an actual electromechanical design problem using a hematology analyzer from industry. This videotape of student teams is edited and PowerPoint slides are inserted outlining the step by step procedure; students also write papers for this project. As a Senior Project Engineer with 14 years experience in industry managing project teams consisting of other Engineers and Technicians, finding new Engineers and Technicians to hire with project team training was important. Also under the ABET guidelines, teaching collaborative problem solving is recommended. This method can be used in any number of technology courses and will help the student prepare for problem solving and working in a team environment. Attendees willing to use this video and participate in a research survey will be given a free copy of the video.},

abstract={Advising is an important task for success of college students, especially students with professional majors, such as engineering. In addition to meeting the breadth of a college education, students in a professional major must also complete depth of study in math and science and the application of this knowledge in professional development. The requirements are strict and the sequencing of courses is critical for both academic success and efficiency in graduating by the desired date. Advisors are more than schedulers of classes. The selection and scheduling of classes should be efficient so both the student and the advisor can focus on issues critical to the academic success of the student. In a global sense, advisors provide the service of career development ranging in process from selection of major to professional development and management of a system of life-long learning. This paper identifies the duties of a modern advisor and discusses the advising process with the aid of web-based tools to increase both the efficiency and quality of advisement. Applications of this technology in the College of Engineering at Texas Tech University have been very successful. Students appreciate the quickness of the process and the ability to consider and plan all activities - not just the courses. Advisors are also happy with the shift away from scheduling and toward professional and personal issues that promote long-term academic and professional success.},

abstract={The goal of Project ExCEL, the Extended Classroom for Enhanced Learning, is to bring the capabilities of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) into elementary and secondary classrooms. We have developed an entirely web-based interface to allow schools to control a modern SEM. The web interface allows a remote user complete control of all the operating parameters of the microscope, including stage movement and x-ray chemical analysis. Such total control currently is not available on any other system. Since pioneering the idea of remote SEM use for K-12 education in the early 1990s, we have learned that merely providing schools and teachers access to high technology equipment does not ensure that it will be used. Many teachers are too busy and their curriculum too structured to allow incorporation of the WebSEM into their lessons. Many lack knowledge in the area of SEM and do not possess confidence in their abilities to operate the instrument. To overcome these problems, MSE is working with the Department of Curriculum and Instruction (C&I) to train future teachers in the use of the WebSEM. Science Education professors are incorporating the WebSEM into their courses and having selected students receive training on its use. These students then prepare lesson plans and present their work to the remainder of the class. Evaluation data from students is positive. In-service teachers receive instruction and training in the WebSEM through summer workshops. By using this integrated approach, it is hoped that all science teachers in Iowa will eventual gain the information, expertise, and confidence to use the WebSEM in their respective classrooms.},

abstract={The construction industry is in the midst of a critical shortage of qualified employees. This includes management personnel with college training in construction related programs. Future forecasts for construction activity are high and the current employee shortage is expected to continue. University construction related programs exist on many campuses with over 20 accredited baccalaureate programs nationwide. The Construction Engineering Technology (CET) program at Murray State University (MSU) has existed since 1970. After several unsuccessful years of recruiting freshmen into the program using traditional methods such as: written correspondence, telephone calls, and high school visits the CET faculty at MSU needed to try a new approach. During the spring of 1999 in cooperation with the education committee of the local Associated General Contractors a joint recruiting plan was developed. An innovative marketing effort that included contractors and MSU faculty was taken to the largest high schools in the region. Large increases in freshman enrollment occurred in the fall class of 1999 and by the fall of 2000 the freshman enrollment had doubled in the CET program at MSU. The marketing effort has demonstrated the ability of a partnership between industry and education to the benefit of both. More graduates entering the local workforce, more internship opportunities and less on-campus concern for the CET program should be positive benefits to increased enrollment.},

abstract={Design education and design project execution requires teamwork and collaborative efforts to be successful. In an academic setting this has typically been achieved by frequent 'face-to-face' meetings between the student design team, faculty consultants, and the project sponsors. Modern technology, via the Internet, has made the collaborative team efforts independent of the constraints of common meeting times and the need for geographical collocation. This paper describes a prototype Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and Virtual Project Management (VPM) system that has successfully been implemented in the undergraduate Mechanical Engineering design classroom at the University of Washington. This system employs the use of a commercially available World Wide Web-based software package that facilitates collaborative work while also providing for the Virtual Project Management needs of both the individual project teams and the course itself. Detailed descriptions of the software program, its implementation into the design classroom, and its use throughout the product design and development cycle are provided. Also presented are the results of surveys, taken by the students of several design courses using the CSCW and VPM software, which aim to discern the attitude of these students towards this prototype system.},

abstract={Children in early elementary school are natural engineers - building and taking apart anything they can get their hands on. Introducing engineering into the classroom at this early age takes advantage of their interest to excite and engage them in math, science, and technology learning. Moreover, it plants the seed for an interest in engineering and can start to combat some of the gender issues associated with engineering. Several members of Tufts University's Center For Engineering Educational Outreach (CEEO) have worked for the past few years at the first grade level to bring engineering into the classroom. Using LEGO materials, CEEO members have collaborated with teachers to create a collection of activities that introduce first graders to forces, frictions, the engineering design process, as well as reinforce math and reading concepts. Activities range from building walls and chairs to discuss forces -- to creating ramp climbing cars to discuss gear rations and torque - to producing a LEGO based movie of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax. This paper will describe the process of creating the activities as well as support required to implement engineering activities at the first grade level.},

abstract={The current paper highlights the impact of the National Science Foundation sponsored curriculum project, which has helped the curriculum innovation by design integration throughout the curriculum. This has been achieved by (i) Redesign of the Freshman Engineering course sequence by incorporating Integrative Learning Blocks by involvement of faculty from engineering, mathematics, physics, humanities and social sciences. (ii) Creation of a new Engineering Design course at Sophomore Year and the development of Integrative Learning with a course on Ethics in the Profession (iii) Redesign of a Junior Year Design course with Integrated Learning with Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. (iv) Partnership with industry in the creation of real-life engineering projects for all Senior Capstone projects. The paper narrates the interdisciplinary focus taken by the project, involving faculty from engineering, mathematics, humanities, etc. It has promoted new teaching and learning paradigms and has emphasized team-building and collaborative learning in engineering, mathematics, sciences and humanities. In addition, it has already influenced the complete reshaping of the 4-year curriculum in the College of Engineering. Various parts of the project have addressed engineering curriculum reform from the freshman to the senior year based on a problem based collaborative learning approach. The clustering arrangement experimented in the courses could serve as a models for others to follow and could be transferable to most other institutions. By working on projects, the benefits of students taking greater responsibility for their own learning has resulted in a cultural change. The students have opportunity to work on well-rounded projects sponsored by outside agencies and industries. The project has a significant chance of sustained impact on engineering education.},

The students were chosen from populations that were underrepresented in the engineering profession. At HACC we sought to accept females and minorities into the program. We were relatively successful with our student enrollments. The curriculum changed slightly over the five-year span of the program, but the project component and the Friday field trips remained constants throughout.

abstract={Manufacturing engineering education at the University of Wisconsin-Stout has gone back to the future. Today's undergraduate manufacturing engineering program utilizes laboratory- and industrial project-based instruction throughout the professional component of the curriculum. The century old Stout tradition of hands-on, minds-on instruction emphasizes engineering and industrial applications balanced with a strong basis of engineering sciences. In today's global marketplace, manufacturers wishing to remain competitive must employ pragmatic engineers with a solid foundation in the engineering sciences, engineering practice, and industrial applications. Stout's newly accredited undergraduate manufacturing engineering program develops these pragmatic engineers in an environment rich in applications and engineering science. In addition to the extensive lab-based methods, real undergraduate industrial projects are funneled to the program through an outstanding technology transfer outreach program. This paper presents the past and present environment that has created this back to the future manufacturing engineering program. Both the methods in which the laboratory based learning environment is utilized and the industrial partnerships that create project opportunities will be presented in this paper. Laboratory innovation and development along with real industrial projects are the keys to the current manufacturing engineering program's success.},

abstract={Graduate classes can be improved by reducing lecture and increasing active learning approaches. Group work, in particular, in class and on projects should be encouraged. It is especially important that professors and other presenters use a number of cooperative group exercises and other active learning approaches in courses and workshops on "Improving the Teaching of Engineering." New professors are much more likely to use cooperative group and other active learning methods if they are exposed to the methods in courses or workshops on teaching techniques. In this paper we delineate the cooperative group parts of our course, ChE 685, "Educational Methods in Engineering." Informal cooperative learning groups are used for small group discussions throughout the semester. Formal groups are used for guided design and course projects. Students have input in the grading of their group members for the projects. Many of these approaches, particularly the design of group projects, can easily be translated to technical courses. The comments on student evaluations indicate the usefulness of the cooperative learning experience.},

abstract={The Texas Tech University College of Engineering has developed an after-school program with local junior high schools to establish a practical means for getting seventh-through ninth-graders excited about science, engineering, and technology. The pilot offering suggests the program has significant potential to attract students from populations that traditionally have been underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines into educational and career paths in these fields. In addition, the program also directly addresses the problem of the growing "digital divide." This program puts computers in students' homes and teaches them meaningful ways to use the technology to relate to their schoolwork, family, and community. At-risk students work side-by-side with their parents and teachers to build their own computers and leam to use them by participating in community-oriented projects that incorporate essentials of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) disciplines. They also develop communication and writing skills with curriculum components involving essay writing, business communication, and civic discourse. One of the most exciting aspects of this program is that students are equal participants in a community of learners that includes both their parents and their teachers. This article includes initial results of the pilot study for this program, conducted with 16 at-risk students from low-income families, their parents, and seven of their teachers during the Spring 2000 semester. Because the pilot demonstrated an extremely high degree of positive potential, a number of entities in the Lubbock community have formed a consortium to significantly extend the scope of the program. This article describes the plan for increasing the scale of the program to make it available to a much larger number of participants and to make the program sustainable over time.},

Although they are very important, contacts with industry should not be limited to R&D exclusively. The four-year programs are very often criticized for not providing graduates with absolutely up-to-date knowledge and skills. Nevertheless, universities should not sacrifice depth of knowledge for current technical skills. By maintaining intellectual integrity, universities make it easier for graduates to ensure a career in the long-term. Successful practices and experiences from CSSU illustrate the possible ways to better respond to industry needs.},

abstract={Designing a curriculum of courses based upon donated equipment can be made easier if the donors help with this task. Not only are equipment manufacturers the best sources for gaining donated state of the art equipment, but they can also be an important resource when it comes time to develop the actual course material and content needed for new courses involving the use and application of their equipment and products. Northeastern University's School of Engineering Technology has been fortunate to have received substantial laboratory equipment donations from major players in the Industrial Control Systems industry. These same players have generously contributed supplemental training materials in addition to their own time to assist in developing course curriculum for our program. This paper addresses the construction of this new curriculum and in particular the part industry has played. The results of a pilot course-program conducted in the Fall of 1999 are included along with comments from participating students.},

abstract={Why computer integrated manufacturing (CM)? CIM brings together components that are typically studied individually over a wide range of disciplines into an integrated system. Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is developing a CIM cell that will meet the needs of two Computer Science courses and nine Engineering Technology courses. The courses include Manufacturing Processes, Design of Machine Elements, Principles of Measurements, Programmable Logic Controllers, Control Systems, Capstone Projects, Systems Programming, and System Analysis and Design. The Mechanical Engineering Technology students benefit from the study of mechanical components, the design of tooling and fixtures, the selection of material handling equipment, pneumatic actuators and clamps, and the relationship of material selection to the manufacturing process. The Control Systems Engineering Technology students study the use of sensors, data acquisition, actuators, networking of equipment, robot controllers, programmable logic controllers, and the communication of the cell with overall factory operations. The Computer Science students will focus on the development of controlling algorithms, cell control, user interfaces, networking, and the manipulation and analysis of the data collected. The manufacture of a product will necessitate the use of interdisciplinary teams of Computer Science, Engineering Technology and other students in their capstone projects classes. The conclusion is that computer integrated manufacturing can be the focal point of study for many disciplines at many different levels.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a web-based Graduate Certificate program in Databases and Client/Server and discusses first evaluation results. Our goal was to find a format that achieves course quality at low development costs, allows for easy student access, and further development. This led to the following design choices: (i) A blend of face-to-face on-site lectures and web-lectures, synchronizing streaming video and audio, with a slide presentation, graphics and animation; (ii) On-line weekly office hours; (iii) Weekly homework assignments, proctored examinations and/or semester projects; (iv) Communication and course management through a course web site, including downloadable teaching materials, homework submission tools, grade management, threaded discussion, chat, e-mail. The first course taught in this format is evaluated against a control section delivered in parallel, and in the traditional classroom format. Student performance and satisfaction in the distance and on-site sections, based on final grades and course evaluation, were very similar. In addition, responses to questionnaires targeting the technology and the delivery format showed a clear endorsement of the approach. Some evaluation results were counter intuitive: very few students requested additional on-line office hours, there was no strong preference for either "on-line only" or "face-to-face only" instruction. This indicates that the combination of synchronous and asynchronous delivery successfully addresses the tradeoff between flexibility and synchronicity.},

abstract={This paper documents interim results of a NSF-CCLI funded project to develop innovative educational materials in Configuration Management (CM) for use as a module in regularly scheduled courses in engineering and management. CM is a methodology for identifying the components of a continuously evolving product and its associated production system, to control changes to these components and to maintain integrity and traceability throughout the system life cycle. CM provides a means to insure effective and efficient engineering and management reviews, costing, and adoption for approved product and process changes. Doing CM well can have a significant influence on reducing costs and improving productivity. Although professional development programs are available to provide corporate managers with an understanding of CM, there is little coverage of CM in typical engineering and management courses in universities. This may partially be the result of limited CM educational resources for faculty use. For that reason, we have prepared a CM Overview Module and Instructor's Guide to be used in a one-to-two week segment of engineering or management courses. The contents of the educational sessions, outside readings, and recommended homework and project assignments are described in this presentation. Also discussed is the use of pre- and post-testing, and the use of an skilled teaching-effectiveness-and-innovation observer, to evaluate the effectiveness of, and make enhancements to, the CM instructional sessions and materials.},

The CURIE 2000 project was a water quality management problem that highlighted technical, social, political, and economic aspects of "real life" engineering. The project was created and delivered by a graduate student in Civil and Environmental Engineering, with support from five undergraduate Program Assistants who facilitated the group interactions and provided social mentoring for the girls. The challenges and rewards of such an ambitious project were plentiful. The CURIE experience not only increased the girls' awareness of the opportunities and technical challenges in engineering, but also allowed them to experience the complex interaction among our society, technology, and environment-an issue not often addressed in the early stages of engineering education.},

abstract={Engineering Technology faculty development is a continuous challenge. Enrichment of faculty through real-life industrial experience provides the opportunity for continuous improvement of technology faculty technical currency. In the summer of 2000, one of the mechanical engineering technology faculty worked with local industry to revive technical skills, learn new skills, observe project management skills, and bring new learned skills into the classroom. He participated as a team member of the company in the startup process of a truck assembly production line. This summer opportunity provided first-hand experience for the faculty member to work in teams with prejeet managers, engineers, technologists, and technicians of different companies. The authors will share their observations and mutual benefits of this partnership and how it has impacted faculty, the college, and industry in several ways. The paper concludes with some suggestions from authors to tie the internship with curriculum development.},

abstract={Gas hydrate storage of gases occurs in nature. Recent core data from USGS deep ocean drilling endeavors form the basis of their estimates of more carbon stored in gas hydrates of ocean sediments than exist in all discoveries of coal, natural gas, and crude oil. Realizing the value of natural gas as a clean-burning, economical, abundant and efficient energy source for peak loads at electrical power plants, but realizing the major impediment of storage means, DOE granted our laboratory a study to determine feasibility of safely storing above-ground natural gas in synthetic gas hydrates. The research suggested a process that provided rapid hydrate formation, complete conversion of interstitial water, and packing of hydrate mass as it formed; 156 volumes of gas at standard temperature and pressure stored in 1 volume of the ice-like hydrate was accomplished. Subsequently, as a semester project, a group of five senior chemical engineering students were asked to put the hydrate research findings into an innovative large-scale plant design for their capstone design course; they were to select, size and cost the equipment; they were to create process flow charts, perform mass/energy balances, and perform an economic analysis of the prospective storage facility for a power plant. Their efforts in the preliminary design predicted that a 2.25 million standard cubic feet storage facility could be economically competitive with conventional natural gas storage if multiple cycles per year were involved. Their in-depth analysis and first-hand laboratory experience proved to be a unique learning experience in energy storage problems.},

The objectives of the project were: to greatly increase the number of sensors available for student use in the laboratory; to introduce modern Computer Data Acquisition equipment and techniques; and to shift the course emphasis as much as possible from lecture to laboratory, using the strengths of interdisciplinary teams of students (MET and EET) to aid in learning. Equipment was purchased, and nine experiments were designed or revised to investigate the behavior of over thirty sensors and sensing systems, as detailed below. Several experiments use National Instruments data acquisition hardware and its LabVIEW software, including custom Virtual Instruments. However, the course is not intended to teach LabVIEW programming. Instead, these tools are used to aid efficient progress through experiments, and to provide real-time graphic displays of sensor and circuit performance. This paper details the lab development, describes the equipment used, describes the use of LabVIEW in this course, and gives feedback on the project and the experience of modernizing the laboratory.},

abstract={The University of Hartford mechatronic curriculum incorporates a language-neutral teaching approach for mechatronics system design courses that links the educational experience more closely with the processes and projects found in industry. Mechatronics education at the University of Hartford focuses on four categories; components (sensors and actuators), computer interfacing electronics, systems (modeling, analysis, simulation, and control), and language-neutral visual programming environments for implementation. The last category is especially important when one considers the extent of general software knowledge in mechanical engineering and the complexity of the language based software development process for developing real time embedded applications. The goals of this paper are to describe (1) the University of Hartford mechatronic curriculum, (2) the language-neutral teaching approach for mechatronics, and (3) a low cost technology demonstrator, developed and refined by the authors, which is suitable for studying the key elements of mechatronics including system dynamics, sensors, actuators, and computer interfacing.},

abstract={A senior design (Capstone) project for three mechanical engineering technology students at Old Dominion University is described. A prototype design is presented to perform the functional test of a leak-preventive toilet system. There are two major leaks in the toilet water tank. In the first case, leaking occurs when the seal in the water tank becomes aged. The leak is very easy to detect visually, since the outside of the tank and the floor becomes wet. In the second case, leak occurs when the flapper valve can't complete shut off the water, due to corrosion or damage of the rubber components. Water will flow down to the toilet through stand-up tube. The leaking may be very difficult to detect, since it may not be noisy and can't be detected visually. Although there have been several ideas proposed to solve the leaking problem, they are either impractical or need critical adjustments during the installation. Also, the operation is usually different from regular flush systems. In this project, students are asked to develop a leak-preventive prototype by modifying the concept of a dual-valve system. In addition to functional analysis, students also consider the factors of manufacturing, installation, operation, design reliability, and adaptability to typical flush systems. Results show that the prototype can prevent the leak very effectively and can be applied to two major toilet flush systems. By using a magnetic activating mechanism in this design, the user won't feel any difference when compared to the operation of either of the flush systems.},

abstract={Several schools have recently incorporated printed circuit board (PCB) mills into EE/EET education as a means of producing PCB's in-house. Compared to breadboards or protoboards, the obvious benefit of the milling technology is the ability to build circuits with more robustness and permanence. Compared to commercial board manufacturers, PCB milling offers quicker turn-around and lower per-board cost. Previous papers have described how PCB mills have been integrated into the curriculum, but there has not been any detailed comparison of the tradeoffs between in-house milling and commercial manufacturing. In this paper we draw upon our experiences in using both circuit board milling and commercial PCB manufacturing for several student design projects. We compare costs, circuit board quality and ease of assembly, faculty time investment, support issues, and most importantly, how the two approaches to PCB construction fundamentally affect engineering instruction. We have identified several disadvantages of PCB milling, including high initial cost, more complex board layout and routing, and consequent limits on circuit complexity. We have also been surprised by some unexpected advantages of PCB milling, such as higher modularity in project designs and greater risk-taking. Our goal is to provide the benefit of experience to schools considering an investment in PCB milling.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to provide insight into the functioning of Boise State University's (BSU) three new M.S. programs in Engineering, namely, Civil (CE), Electrical (EE), and Mechanical (ME) Engineering. These programs were created as a result of a tremendous collaborative effort with partners from higher education, government, and industry. Notable examples include (i) $12 million in a community funded effort to construct two new engineering buildings that became operational in 2000; (ii) $5 million in laboratory equipment donations from Micron, HP, American Microsystems, SCP, Cascade Microtech, Teradyne, and Zilog; (iii) $5 million in research and equipment grants in the Year 2000; (iv) development of four new "distance" graduate courses to be offered to the industry and the community-at-large via various video delivery modes; (v) participation of four industry experts as adjunct faculty for teaching BSU graduate courses; and (vi) 10,000 man-hours donated by industry engineers to train BSU faculty and technicians in the use of sophisticated laboratory equipment. The newly created M.S. programs in CE, EE, and ME are engaged in an interdisciplinary research effort, which is discussed in this article. The technical goal is to minimize the use of hazardous chemicals in cleaning high aspect ratio microstructures. Broader goals include dynamic curricula development, and student leadership and mentoring opportunities that will enhance the quality of graduate education and attract new students to the programs. This project symbolizes the commitment shared by the faculty and their partners in the industry and in the government to ensure the rapid, collaborative growth of professionally oriented graduate programs at BSU.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship and education have gotten engaged in the last few years, and will either enjoy a blissful marriage or require some counseling to prevent a breakup. Some universities might reject the idea of creating new companies or products based on faculty or student research. There could be nostalgia for pure research, where scientific research funds do not depend on business marketing success or failure. Other universities might wrongly expect entrepreneurship to be the panacea for funding ills, creating a free flow of capital into the research environment. Balancing the two, scientific research and product creation, allows a university to benefit from commercial successes and keep the focus on teaching students. This paper describes the success of one trial program conducted at Oklahoma Christian University in Edmond, Oklahoma. The flexibility of the electrical engineering curriculum allowed students to pursue their own invention as a senior design project. The engineering faculty, intrigued with the project, allowed the students to stay on after graduation. The students cleaned out a storeroom and started a company. In return, the students signed a license agreement with the university that provides a means for profits to be shared with the engineering department. Along with the university, the State of Oklahoma helped these young engineers. They benefited from established technology commercialization centers, grants, and cooperative legislation created to keep technologies and skilled workers in the state. The success of this project can serve as an example for universities wishing to try an informal program. With a flexible curriculum and a supportive environment, entrepreneurship can flourish even without a fully dedicated academic program.},

abstract={Since the summer intern experience for students in construction engineering and management technologies has become so important to them, most have not been able to enroll in on-site summer school classes. In the past students have taken such summer school classes in order to reduce their class load during the fall and spring semesters. The description of the process used to determine if interest in a summer, 2000, Internet course existed as well as which course would be offered will be reviewed. Further discussion will focus on the methods of delivery and their technical problems as they related to the implementation of the course work. With the adoption of Electronic Blackboard at Pittsburg State University in the spring, 2000 semester, a foundation was established upon which to build an Internet-based course. The format of the course material for "Civil Construction" made it possible for twenty-two students to participate. Lessons learned as well as suggestions for implementation and improvement will be provided. Although numerous obstacles in the delivery of such a course occurred, the benefits far outweigh the difficulties. Reflection of the experiences in this prototype for the Department of Engineering Technology has resulted in an interest from other faculty in other departments who would like to introduce Electronic Blackboard in their classes.},

abstract={In 1999 Dr. Luke Faulkenberry at the University of Houston and Dr. Larry Brillhart at North Harris College in Houston were given a small Ford Foundation Mini-grant under the auspices of the University of Houston to try to start an electrical-electronics technology teachers association in the Houston-Gulf Coast area. This association is to include teachers from high schools, community colleges, universities, and proprietary schools. The objective is to bring the electrical-electronics technology teachers together to discuss items of common interest, forge linkages between the schools, and improve communications among the teachers and the schools represented. The first meeting was held on April 28, 1999. Twenty-five of the approximately 80 electrical-electronics teachers in the area attended. Among the items of common interest are articulation, curriculum matters, political matters effecting teaching and education funding, and teaching methodplogies. The next meeting is November 10, 2000. There are funds enough for three meetings, so another funded meeting will be held in the spring semester of 2001, although the final report is due in December of 2000. This paper will summarize the progress of the association through spring 2001, and provide any lessons learned to assist people wishing to start a similar association.},

Analog signal conditioning, measurement and data storage is now being accomplished using the data acquisition and control package Lab View, by National Instruments. This powerful tool has been implemented throughout the curriculum, ranging from introduction as freshmen with simple mechanical measurements and data storage, to culmination with a senior design project that typically involves control and automation, achieved using the Lab View system. A primary focus of the paper will be the philosophy of the introduction of computer software packages in a four year engineering technology curriculum, and how they can be used to reinforce key concepts found in MET. The paper will also detail some of the introductory and advanced laboratories that have been developed, the specific hardware that was purchased, the results of student lab reports and assessment of student outcomes.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to present the current status of the course ME-510: Introduction to the Computer Simulation of Metal Forming Processes that was developed at Kettering University (KU). Currently, this course is offered independent of another course "Sheet Metal Forming", which deals with the real forming technology. However, 3 to 5 students take both these classes. The ME-510 class is well received by both the students and the participating industrial sponsors. At the ASEE2000 Conference in St. Louis, MO, the background, philosophy, benefits and limitations of offering a course sequence on the real and virtual forming was discussed. Due to a recent curriculum reform at Kettering University, many courses were revised, and wherever possible some of the courses or course topics have been integrated. With regard to the above mentioned two courses on metal forming, it became evident that there may be a possibility of integrating them in to a basic single course that covers both real and virtual forming scenarios. Initial feedback of the students taking these two classes supports this idea. This new proposal is still in its discussion stage and the resulting outcomes of such integration if any, will be presented in a future conference. This paper outlines the integration of some of the real forming technology in to the virtual forming course. In addition, the evaluation and assessment tools developed for this course will be addressed. Also, the results of some of the undergraduate/ graduate student applied research projects will be presented in more detail at the meeting, and the role of tool-based learning discussed. Due to the large size of the simulated computer graphics files, the detailed results will only be presented at the conference meeting. Finally, the author's perception of the course layout of a possible integrated course is presented in an Appendix.},

abstract={A Report titled "Expanding the Technology Workforce" 1 prepared by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board found that : "...Texas Students are not being sufficiently informed nor prepared for some of the most interesting, challenging, and lucrative careers in the new economy" 1 "The recruitment of top quality high school students to the engineering profession is an area which needs to be pursued..." 1. The insufficiency noted in the above referenced report, which can be best directly addressed by colleges of engineering, is the matter of informing the students at the high school and junior high school. Many of these students have a bright interest in science but no goal or realistic grasp of what they would do with what they learn in high school science courses, even though the courses are available to them. Since those courses are often the more demanding, motivation is highly important. This paper presents the methods used at UT Tyler to address this problem. These methods integrate a component into junior and senior level design courses that places the college engineering students in high school classrooms. There, these students then explain actual engineering design projects and the field of engineering to students who can be motivated and recruited to the engineering profession.},

abstract={The beginning of the 21 st century is witnessing an awareness that the civil engineering industry has become a global industry. The rapid increase in foreign ownership of firms in the United States together with the globalization of economic markets is reminding civil engineering professionals that they must be aware of global events before they impact local operating conditions. In response to these developments, university programs must begin to broaden their focus to include subjects that address new economy realities. Specifically, the time has arrived to require students to have exposure to management topics such as entrepreneurship, financial management, and global economics. If the civil engineering industry desires to evolve into a new economy business, then it will require individuals who are as comfortable with the financial and technology components of the business as they are with design or construction fundamentals.},

abstract={Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU), founded in 1963, is a regional comprehensive public university that has seen steady growth in enrollment to its current level of about 8500 students. Within the University, the College of Science, Engineering, and Technology is home to ABET accredited undergraduate programs in both mechanical and electrical engineering, but does not offer any discipline specific graduate programs. In 1998, to meet the needs of working professionals, a graduate program designed to add technical knowledge, leadership and management strategies to existing workplace skills was initiated. This degree, called the Master of Science in Technological Processes, includes coursework in both technical and professional disciplines, and is targeted at individuals with undergraduate degrees in science, engineering, computer science, mathematics, or engineering technology. The program is offered entirely on campus with evening classes and concludes with an industry-based capstone Field Project. In this paper the first two plus years of the program are presented and analyzed. The student population, which has developed into an interesting mixture that includes a significant international population and a broad representation of undergraduate majors, is discussed. Other demographics of interest presented include the ratio of full time to part time students, and the gender and age distribution of the students. Also included is a description of the faculty who make up the program, both full time and adjunct, who themselves represent a wide variety of disciplines. Interaction with industry, including participation in final projects and acceptance of program graduates is also presented.},

We believe mechanical design is the most important and convenient application to employ for the following reasons: (1) it closely follows the mechanics theory, (2) it requires an understanding of the theory, (3) it introduces markets and mechanical technology to students, (4) it connects students with information available on the Internet and in libraries and (5) it broadens their world view of engineering through human factors, reliability, environmental, international diversity and other concerns. In this paper we select one student design project from an introductory strength of materials course and show how these reasons, when converted into course objectives, are met. The positive outcomes are clear in that students learn far more than analysis. Less clear is whether learning by doing' motivates and enables all learners. The negative outcome is that such a full-featured course is not for every student. Some simply cannot put abstract equations into practical use; others find it difficult working in teams. We summarize these and other challenges to implementing a design-based curriculum in undergraduate mechanics courses.},

abstract={As computer technology advances, graphical design environments (GDEs) and visualization tools to support engineering design and decision making are gaining prominence and recognition, particularly in the area of multiobjective design and optimization. In this paper, we discuss an experiment in two graduate courses that was designed to evaluate GDEs through in-class student assignments. For this first set of experiments, a GDE was developed for designing an I-beam cross section with two competing objectives. Within the GDE, students were allowed to vary the values of the design variables and view the corresponding performance graphically in an effort to obtain an optimal design based on a weighted sum of the objectives. Methods for evaluating student efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction within a GDE are discussed, and preliminary results from the experiment verify that graphical design environments can improve design quality and overall satisfaction with the design. The importance of rapid graphical feedback in a GDE is also investigated by incorporating time delays in the performance response. The use of graphical design environments to improve student understanding of design tradeoffs in the classroom is discussed, and results from the I-beam experiment are compared with a previous assignment wherein students had to choose an optimal design without the use of a graphical design interface.},

abstract={A few short years ago, when a university or college advertised for a tenure track position, it would receive 200+ responses with many well-qualified applicants. Today a similarly advertised position may produce only 20 or less responses and many of them may not be qualified. The problem appears to be multifaceted and the schools with four-year programs appear to be having a more difficult time than schools with two-year programs. The present day labor market is normally singled out as the culprit for the hiring problems but there are other contributing factors. Other areas that need to be examined are the Ivory Tower concepts, ABET requirements, rules of tenure, and philosophy of the older faculty/administration. This paper will look at the roadblocks in the hiring process and consider what needs to happen to open the window of opportunity for hiring the non-traditional faculty members. It will also consider alternatives to the classical profile used in many recruiting campaigns. The need for the non-traditional faculty and the half-life of faculty is also explored. There is a need to adjust hiring practices to include these highly qualified, non-traditional persons in our search and screen process.},

abstract={In order to heed the call in engineering education to provide richer learning environments, in which engineering students develop critical skills to work effectively on teams with individuals from other fields, we need to encourage development of multidisciplinary, multilevel learning experiences in which students play lead roles. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Mini-Baja competition project at Penn State Altoona is one example of how faculty and students have been addressing this need. The project is structured as a functional organization, with students from many disciplines (engineering, engineering technology, business, English and art) engaged in supporting vehicle design, development and testing efforts. The student team, consisting of freshmen through seniors, are grouped by functional area (vehicle subsystem design, documentation, marketing, fabrication and testing) and coordinated by a "directorate" of upperclassmen. Students earn college credit for some of the activities, but the majority of the effort is on a volunteer basis. The project provides an excellent environment for cross-disciplinary learning, as well as team and project management skill development, and is an efficient way to carry on a major design effort. In addition, the project provides engineering research opportunities for one of the authors. The paper discusses the project organization in detail, and discusses the means and limitations of involving faculty and students from various disciplines in a broad integration of teaching, service to the profession and community, and research.},

The purpose of the ATL is to provide a vehicle that enables partnerships between industry, faculty, and students. This partnership is designed to produce research for industry and provide real-life projects for students in the form of thesis and graduation exit required senior projects. Thus, the implications of the ATL are a win-win environment for all involved. The Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) provides a crucible where students can undertake defining educational capstone experiences that fully reflect new ABET criteria and the new millennium. This paper describes the computing resources and systems that have been put in place to support this goal.

Courses on Computer Graphics that have replaced the instruction of Descriptive Geometry in most Architectural Engineering curricula, are mainly focused on methods for the communication of knowledge and information about the design of a building and its representation. This paper presents a personal effort to address Computer Graphics in the Architectural Engineering Curriculum not only as a representational and visualization tool but also as a means of extending spatial understanding and as a method of informing the design process. Towards this effort a body of knowledge mainly from Descriptive Geometry has been integrated into the instruction of Computer Graphics courses. Concepts such as parametric form development, topological surfaces, as well as advanced visualization procedures, including kinematic simulations, have also been added to the body of knowledge covered by these courses.},

The experiences are hands-on experiments with the hope that kindergartners can learn at-their-level fundamental electricity concepts. Knowledge of electricity theory through experiences is the end goal. One way this will be accomplished is by providing the students with first a concept, then asking them to make predictions. Introducing students to engineering at the kindergarten level is obviously a long term investment but what better a time to peak their interest and curiosity at such a vital age. The project also provides university faculty with the opportunity to serve the community.},

This paper provides actual instructional materials for three inexpensive active-learning activities that can be performed by first-semester freshmen to introduce them to engineering and motivate them to learn a suite of computer applications. Two of them are in-class laboratory experiments that provide data to analyze with MathCAD or Excel. The third activity is a team design project that is best performed around Halloween. Student feedback indicates that these simple hands-on activities effectively introduce students to fundamental engineering concepts.},

abstract={Sooner City, a curriculum reform project undertaken by the School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science at the University of Oklahoma, seeks to thread a common design project (developing a city's infrastructure) throughout the undergraduate curriculum, starting in the freshman year. The project, begun in 1996, is supported by the University of Oklahoma and the National Science Foundation, most recently through its Action Agenda program. Sooner City has received local and national recognition, including most recently, two Oklahoma Regents' Awards for outstanding faculty innovation. In summer 2000, a workshop was held to report on the project's status and to solicit information from other faculty about teaching design and how to make it more portable to their institutions. The workshop, a series of topical lectures followed by breakout sections, was attended by 24 faculty from a wide-variety of public and private institutions.

Several curriculum modifications were initiated in the electrical engineering (EE) and computer engineering (CompE) senior capstone courses in Fall 1999. The improvements include a regular weekly class meeting guided by senior advisors, emphasis on team projects and systematic and incremental writing deadlines. The important curriculum innovation is that the students usually do not write more than a page or two for any weekly assignment, yet when assembled the individual assignments form a complete design report.},

abstract={In 1995 the Aviation Technology (AT) Industrial Advisory Committee suggested the need to provide additional communication, team building, presentation, and business skills for AT students. In response, the AT department began working with several air carriers doing applied research in the areas of human factors and safety. Projects include shift turnover communication, ramp safety, lifting ergonomics, flow mapping, and error prediction. Each project is under the leadership of a student team leader with additional students working in support. The teams are paired with a faculty member. The main goal of these projects is for students to obtain real experience, enhance their leadership and team skills, and improve presentation skills. Students coordinate all activities from designing metrics to arranging for travel. This has created a pipeline of highly qualified students with enhanced skills beyond what the classroom can provide-. These students are highly recruited upon graduation. The AT department acts as a partner, not a consultant to the industrial participant. Solutions are devised, tested, and implemented by the students and the air carrier works in conjunction with the students during this process. As the project evolves, the AT department withdraws to an advisory position leaving the air carrier with something they helped devise and continue with on their own. The benefits to the students have been tremendous. Numerous papers co-authored with the faculty have been presented at significant conferences worldwide. Students work with all levels of personnel including upper management and vice presidents making presentations of results. Over 50 internships supporting these projects have resulted during 2000 alone. Establishing applied industry research partnership opportunities has been a tremendous success for all involved, especially the students. The exposure and experience gained is invaluable in preparing for their upcoming careers in the aerospace and air transport industries.},

abstract={This paper will focus on an ethics curriculum that has been developed for design projects. The rationale behind it is discussed and some preliminary feedback from students is reviewed. The curriculum for the design projects is distinctive in several fundamental ways. These departures from more traditional views of "engineering ethics" were not come by easily and they have taken many years to develop. 1) We view all design as necessarily ethical and the purpose of ethics curricula is not the addition of ethics but an enhancement of the ethical imagination. 2) While traditional ethics often focus on the individual, decisions in technology are made collectively - including, of course, people who are not engineers. So, our approach includes an emphasis on social ethics, i. e, the social arrangements for making decisions. 3) Technology represents transformations of society and of the environment. We encourage students to understand this and to look both upstream and downstream in the product or service life cycle from the design focal point. 4) Most technology involves transformations that are global in scope and this is embraced by the curriculum. 5) We stress design because most of the important decisions about technology are taken or mirrored there. 6) Finally, design affects everyone but not everyone affects design. We take this as the defining ethical tension in design.},

The online version of the course was offered on a standard semester schedule and had due dates approximately every week, but was otherwise asynchronous. The initial and ongoing development and management of the course follows a model that is different than the traditional single-faculty instructor course model. There are five roles in this model: (1) course developers or content experts, (2) instructional designers, (2) course supervisor or "instructor of record," (3) distance learning instructors, and (5) technical support personnel. In this paper, the authors share their experiences as course developers, course supervisor, and learning leaders for the "Fundamentals of Computer Systems" course.

abstract={In the traditional model of manufacturing education, the manufacturing processes course has been offered with a lab component while other manufacturing related courses are offered as lecture only. Linkage between courses is often not implemented in the curricula. A second issue is the growing movement towards closing competency gaps that have been identified by educators and industry. This paper discusses an approach being taken at Marquette University to help close competency gaps and incorporate a higher level of horizontal integration between manufacturing courses using the Learning Factory approach. Rather than limiting usage of the manufacturing lab to one course, it instead forms an integrated environment for hands-on learning across the manufacturing curriculum using a variety of manufacturing technologies. As one means of assessing this approach, the impact of the methodology is being measured using a quantitative index (v-function) which was developed at Marquette University for measuring the quality of soft indices.},

abstract={IME, Inc. is a new two-semester undergraduate course in which multidisciplinary student teams first design and prototype new products, and then produce them in volume. The objective in the Course is to provide students with manufacturing and production experiences analogous to those obtained by an English student working on a student-run newspaper. The course integrates the traditional capstone design experience with hands-on experience in volume production and manufacturing; students must consider all aspects of manufacturing - including process planning, tooling, assembly, outsourcing, and final costs - so that they can produce approximately 100 units using the new Factory for Advanced Manufacturing Education. The course also focuses on creating an environment that promotes self-directed learning, problem solving, teamwork, project planning, communication, and presentation skills. Assessment strategies for evaluating team performance and the impact on students' learning readiness are discussed. In particular, design notebooks and frequent design reviews are used throughout the course to monitor progress during design and production as well as evaluate team performance. Finally, plans for using IME, Inc. as a "living factory" and involving students from other majors (e.g., business and information technology) are also discussed.},

The ultimate goals of the project are: to educate engineering faculty in instructional design techniques that are then implemented throughout the curriculum to transform the classroom into an active learning environment using cooperative learning and other learning approaches, and to efficiently and effectively incorporate the use of information technology in the learning process. Initial efforts at Bucknell University have focussed on getting both faculty and students to work together as teams. For the first time, faculty members from across the engineering disciplines are making coordinated and sustained efforts to change the way they teach. This paper discusses the results of those initial efforts, including successes and failures of the initial implementation. The changes discussed were implemented in courses across the engineering curriculum, both in terms of class year and major. Conclusions and lessons are drawn from all of these courses, and three courses in particular are highlighted, to demonstrate "real" application of cooperative and collaborative learning ideas. While students and to some extent faculty are resistant to change, the observations of the Catalyst group show that altering the focus of engineering education is a worthwhile endeavor.},

abstract={In order to be successful, tenure-track faculty members strive to develop distinct research programs that lead to funded work and publications. To be sure, faculty must also be successful in other areas such as teaching effectiveness and service to their university and profession. It is in the pursuit of a distinct research area that tenure-track faculty often overlook, or even purposefully avoid, opportunities to collaborate with other faculty members in their department. Their appears to be a blind notion that such interactions can lead to a reduced level of recognition for one's unique contributions. In contrast, tenured faculty members are less aggressive in avoiding research interactions and, in many instances, often seek out such opportunities. This team-friendly environment allows synergistic activities to evolve and be capitalized on, leading to stronger research programs. From an external perspective, funding agencies are placing a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary research projects. This trend has led to increased pressure on faculty to collaborate. In the case of industry-funded research, where projects tend to follow a multidisciplinary model, it is almost always the case that multiple investigators are involved. This paper addresses the issue of collaboration among tenure-track faculty members and describes several benefits that have resulted from a collaborative atmosphere created by tenure-track faculty members within the Electronics Engineering Technology Program at Texas A&M University.},

abstract={Successful competition in the global economy is increasingly dependent on a stream of new products and services that will open up new business possibilities. At the same time it is increasingly evident that new products and services must be regarded not only as commodities in a marketplace, but also as social actors which can constrain or enable the quality of our life. In recognition of these two perspectives, Product Design and Innovation (PDI) is a new undergraduate dual degree program at Rensselaer that seeks to educate students for careers in new product development. PDI is a dual major program satisfying the requirements for the Bachelor of Science programs in engineering and Science, Technology and Society (STS). PDI prepares students to become innovative designers who can integrate contemporary technologies with changing social contexts for a new generation of advanced product designs. This paper will describe the PDI program, its goals, how it was formulated, and review experiences we have had in offering the first three years of this innovative program. We will provide the curriculum templates and discuss how the design studio sequence fits together.},

Over 50 students have used the groundwater simulators. The instructors and students have learned a lot from the experience. However, we have many suggestions for improvement in student instrumentation activities. Modifications to the lab exercises have improved instrumentation usage and student knowledge, skills, and problem solving abilities. Community projects have used this instrumentation too. Community pollution concerns are being investigated with this instrumentation. Local employers have requested students trained with this instrumentation to apply for employment.

The issues are generally created by pride and misunderstanding. Improved communication would be an obvious approach to mitigating the contention. Further questions are how much of this contention and concern may be fostered initially in the academic setting, and how much might be mitigated by efforts during the student's education program? To explore these issues a one-and-a-half day symposium was held in April 1998 at Idaho State University (ISU), co-sponsored by Boise State University and-Ricks College.

It has been developed and taught as part of an on-going course at Florida Atlantic University titled: "Introduction to Inventive Problem Solving in Engineering", and has been sponsored in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA). The Eight-dimensional problem solving methodology is a systematic approach that stimulates innovation by effectively using both sides of the brain. The methodology is a unified approach that builds on comprehensive problem solving knowledge from industry, business, marketing, math, science, engineering, technology, and daily life. It allows to quickly generate unique, and high-quality multiple solutions in a short period of time. Problems are not constrained to a particular profession or subject, and may be used by individuals and teams. The methodology works extremely well in brainstorming sessions. It is easy to teach, learn and use. This new methodology has been taught using hands-on activities that include more than 250 different 3-D mechanical puzzles, many games, brain-teasers, LEGO Mindstorms competitions, and design projects, each of which illustrates principles and strategies in inventive problem solving. These activities allow for self-paced, semi-guided exploration that improves self-esteem and encourages questioning and daring. The Eight-dimensional methodology has been recently evaluated with encouraging results.},

abstract={This paper describes a NSF-funded Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) project on membrane process experiments funded through DUE-9850535. We have addressed teaching students about the emerging field of membrane processes through team projects. The development plan involves the innovative use of membrane technology, integrating it both vertically and horizontally throughout the engineering curriculum and exposing students to it through the use of team-oriented experimental projects in multidisciplinary engineering clinics. We have initially introduced membrane separation principles in various courses through lectures and small-scale mini-labs and demos. This lays the foundation for more comprehensive study in the engineering clinics. The integration of membrane process experiments for multidisciplinary team projects occurs in the Junior and Senior level Engineering Clinic courses. Some of the realistic and challenging experimental projects started so far include: reverse osmosis system design and function in water purification, gas permeation processes, membrane bioreactors and hollow fiber membrane gas transfer for environmental control, ceramic membrane reactors used in petrochemical processing, and electrodialysis and ultrafiltration processes for separation in the specialty chemicals industry. In these process research and development projects students, learn how to function in a team to solve complex problems, interpret and analyze data, utilize modern technologies, and understand environmental issues. Some projects have included industrial mentors. To broaden the impact of the project, the Rowan team has also used membrane technology to help attract high school students to engineering through the development of innovative demonstration modules.},

abstract={The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has adopted a revised set of criteria for accrediting engineering programs. Nevertheless, as in the past, civil (construction) engineering departments will be required to demonstrate proficiency in specific subject areas which are included in the ABET program criteria. This paper investigates, according to civil engineering and construction related students, the level at which their understanding of various subject areas required by ABET has been enhanced by part-time and summer work experiences. In particular, the findings suggest that both undergraduate and graduate students believe that three areas have been greatly enhanced with engineering work. They include structural engineering, project management/scheduling and estimating, and team work. In addition, undergraduates also perceive that their understanding of health and safety issues, and ethical considerations has also increased. In contrast, graduate students believe that their knowledge of hydraulics/hydrology/water resources, constructability and economic factors has been enhanced by work experiences.},

The client has been the West Point Association of Graduates (AOG), which then represents USMA to provide the facilities and services only possible through gift projects, such as a non-funded sports team facility. The model consists of two phases: first, an independent study by three to eight students to define the project (i.e., 10 percent submittal - concept design); second, the civil engineering majors in multiple teams complete the design of the facility. The capstone designs developed by the multiple senior design teams provide the feasibility studies and/or architectural/engineering products required for marketing the project to potential donors. Work in other courses is completed concurrently to provide real time input to the design process.},

abstract={As we continue to merge global markets it is inevitable that many of today's graduates will participate in international activities when they enter the workforce. It is imperative that we prepare our students for this global work environment. Described is a project between students in the United States and the Slovak Republic aimed at improving both technical communications and cultural understanding between the two groups. The students in the United States were seniors in a two-semester capstone design sequence in Electrical Engineering Technology (EET) at Purdue University. The Slovak students were Ph.D. candidates from the Faculty of Materials Science (MtF) at the Slovak University of Technology (SUT). Their studies included Material Science, Plant Management, Automation and Control, and Machine Technologies. The MtF students were enrolled in a course entitled "English for Specific Purposes", allowing all communications to be in English. Both groups reviewed technical English written by peers including flaws and idiomatic expressions. The primary advantage of this collaboration is that it is not constrained by curricular discipline, making it easily adaptable by other disciplines.

abstract={A new two-semester capstone senior design course sequence in the area of assistive technology has been developed and integrated within the established curriculum of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst. Entitled "Senior Design Projects to Aid the Disabled," the capstone sequence includes close collaborations with the Lemelson Assistive Technology Development Center (LATDC) at Hampshire College and Adaptive Design Services (ADS) under the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation (DMR). The new design course allows students to work directly with collaborators and disabled clients to solve specific assistive technology design problems. Through these projects, students enhance and reinforce concepts learned in their engineering education. At the conclusion of the sequence, each student will have conceived, modeled, analyzed, and built a functional prototype of a mechanical and/or electromechanical device that satisfies the specific need of an individual client. Early results of merging engineering education and an area of social significance have been very positive. Students have welcomed both the hands-on and personal contribution aspects of their projects. In many cases, projects have led to research extensions, additional community connections, and for many students, inspiration to continue with graduate studies. The objective of this paper is to report on the motivation, design, and results of the capstone course sequence in assistive technology. Specific projects, past and current, are also highlighted.},

abstract={This paper describes the context, format, experiences, and outcome of three multidisciplinary team project-based pilot courses focused on teaching entrepreneurial skills and invention: 1. ME 490 "Invention and Entrepreneuring," co-taught by two professors (from engineering and business) at Michigan Tech for multidisciplinary students during fall quarter 1999. 2. NI D041 "Creative Problem Solving, Innovation and Entrepreneuring," a four-week intensive multidisciplinary course in a new one-year MSc in Entrepreneurship, Science and Technology program at the University of Nottingham during October 2000. 3. MODULE 12 "Entrepreneurship," a one-week condensed course in a University of Nottingham part-time MBA program co-taught by two business professors in Singapore for managers and engineers in business and industry in November 2000. With special attention paid to teaching explicit thinking and creative problem solving skills and processes, as well as multidisciplinary and whole-brain team development, the student projects can result in viable invention - products or processes - that are patentable and can lead to the formation of a new business enterprise, as illustrated with some of the student project results. Students become excited about applying what they have learned and branch out into developing additional creative ideas and projects on their own.},

abstract={The enhanced global perspectives brought on by exploding information technologies have precipitated dramatic changes in industry. Recognizing that suppliers and customers are stakeholders in the product realization process and bringing them onto the production team has resulted in significant improvement in quality and efficiency. Engineering education would do well to follow this model. Communication and cooperation between colleges of engineering and those who hire our graduates are expanding everywhere. Now we must give greater attention to our suppliers. We can no longer afford to allow our K-12 suppliers to"throw high school graduates over-the-wall" to colleges of engineering resulting in high rejection and dropout rates. Utah's Governor has recently called for a doubling of graduates from Utah's colleges of engineering within five years and tripling in eight. This paper describes some of the initiatives underway at Utah State University to motivate, guide, and help create a more seamless experience for students who could potentially do well in engineering.},

Nevertheless, as in the past, civil (construction) engineering departments will be required to demonstrate proficiency in specific subject areas which are included in the ABET program criteria. This paper investigates, according to civil engineering and construction related students, the level at which the understanding of various subjects required by ABET has been enhanced by being involved with the steel bridge and concrete canoe projects. In particular, the findings suggest that both students who are directly and also those indirectly involved with project work believe that three areas have been greatly enhanced. They include: structural engineering, project management/ scheduling and estimating, and team work. Understanding of engineering codes and standards, health and safety issues, materials engineering, and manufacturability (constructability) are also perceived to be enhanced.},

These institutions also offer College 101 or University 101 courses, in addition to developmental courses in mathematics and english, that facilitate the transition of students into college life and help retain them in college. Missouri Western State College (MWSC) is one such open access institution which offers COL 101: Freshman Seminar courses and believes in learning communities, and freshman interest groups (FIG). A FIG is a group of 20-22 MWSC freshmen who enroll in the same cluster of classes during their freshman year on campus. Each FIG creates a supportive and friendly learning community which facilitates the freshman year experience at Missouri Western. This paper describes the impact of student success programs at Missouri Western in retention of engineering technology students, and the impact of teaching a section of COL 101 course. Some statistics are cited that point to success in strategies in retention of ET students at Missouri Western State College.},

abstract={The Industrial Management program at Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) has begun the process of designing and implementing an outcomes assessment process for to continuous improvement of the programs and in preparation for accreditation by the National Association of Industrial Technology. The university contracted with Enable Technologies, Inc., to conduct a pilot study using EnableOA, which is a Web-based, software-driven assessment process. The study involved two courses TEC 110 - Fundamentals of Engineering Drafting and TEC 250 - Industrial Safety in the Fall semester 2000. Two additional courses, TEC 237 - Mechanics/Statics and TEC 437 - Materials Testing and Measurement were used in the spring, 2001. Results of the study show that the EnableOA process was relatively easy to learn for instructors and students. The instructor spent approximately four hours incorporating the first course into the assessment system, and less than half that time incorporating additional courses. It is anticipated that in the future only one hour of assessment software preparation per existing course will be adequate. Students were introduced to the process, which involved the creation and maintenance of an electronic portfolio, in a single class period for one course and via Email for the second course. Student participation was entirely voluntary. Approximately two thirds of 37 eligible students participated in the fall term. The quality of the material that students submitted was, in general, good or moderate quality; however, students had difficulty associating their respective educational experiences to appropriate educational outcomes. The data and reports that were automatically generated by EnableOA were judged to be useful for continuous improvement and accreditation, with the caveat that students must improve their ability to select appropriate outcomes. The university expects to continue developing the assessment program using EnableOA.},

The rationale for this NSF sponsored project is to enable aviation maintenance instructors and learners derive maximum benefits from state-of-art computer technologies through the creation of a groundbreaking, proactive learning tool for this profession. Three modules addressing landing gear operation, turbine engine and aircraft stability comprises the aviation maintenance training on line system. We believe that this new learning system will address the needs of the aviation industry worldwide, and enable a shorter cycle time in training aircraft maintenance technicians thereby reducing overall training costs for the industry as a whole. Although our system is primarily designed to prepare professionals, it may also be used to advertise general engineering or aeronautical engineering as a career choice for middle and high school students. As more and more young people become computer literate early on in their lives, integrated media tools will be highly beneficial in attracting talented students to explore the field of aviation science and technology.},

abstract={When new technologies are developed, often they are introduced to engineering and technology students at the upper baccalaureate or graduate level. Over time, as the technologies mature, they are introduced to students and used by students earlier in the educational process. Such is the case with finite element analysis (FEA). FEA up to now generally has been introduced to engineering and technology students at the junior or senior level. Recently, associate degree graduates with exposure to FEA have been in demand by some industries. The sophistication and relative user-friendliness of modern modeling and analysis software has made it possible for an early introduction of FEA. This paper relates the experience and advantages of introducing FEA in a Statics course. The application of FEA was used to verify manual calculations and help predict if failure would occur where expected and in an expected mode. Through the analysis, build, and test process the students gained an appreciation for the power and limitations of FEA. Students also gained a first use experience that serves as a foundation for more sophisticated models and analysis for FEA use in future courses.},

The CEOs Program was initiated in the fall semester of 2000 for students interested in starting entrepreneurial ventures when they graduate. The University and its corporate partners provide many resources, activities, courses, technologies and services to assist the students in learning how to start successful companies. An important feature is that students admitted to the Program live together in an incubator-like residence hall where they can freely exchange ideas with like-minded students. Living and learning together, these students are provided with a unique opportunity to interact with their fellow CEOs. This environment has the potential to impact the way the CEOs think about their careers, their destinies, and their ability to start businesses right out of school.},

abstract={The Engineering Management Program at Washington State University has an innovative university/industry partnership for training tomorrow's technical leaders. The Engineering Management graduate degree is designed to meet the educational needs of working engineers with a thrust towards project management, manufacturing management, quality engineering, systems engineering, design for manufacturing and theory of constraints. Students can choose from electives to customize this study of world-class management of technology. The Washington Higher Education Telecommunication System (WHETS), web-based instruction, and satellite allow the delivery of Engineering Management courses throughout the State and nationwide. Participants come from a multitude of industries and companies. This paper concentrates on the relationship with one company, The Boeing Company, with corporate offices in Seattle, Washington, with students and facilities across the country. Students of the Engineering Management Program complete class projects as a normal part of every course and as a final end-of-program project. These projects address issues that apply within their organizations. This paper explores the value The Boeing Company has received from the student projects. A recent survey of 55 students reported 109 projects valued at $39.1 million for an average of $710,000 per student for those reporting. This paper summarizes ten representative projects.},

abstract={The primary distinction between Technology and Engineering education is the emphasis on applications in the Technology curricula. This emphasis usually results in much shorter learning curve for Technologists entering the work force in manufacturing industries. The learning curve for a new technologist is largely driven by the ability to find information and to apply theory to actual applications. This paper illustrates some uses of the Internet to bring current manufacturing technology problems to life in the classroom and also provide real world data gathering skills for the student. Classes in plastics manufacturing technology and in automation are used as examples. Applications are presented using actual manufacturer's literature to design industrial control systems and polymer manufacturing systems. This approach accomplishes several goals. • It teaches students how to locate data on actual equipment. • It facilitates an understanding of the theoretical principles taught in the classroom by applying it to problems involving commercially available materials. • It facilitates projects that are closer to actual engineering assignments in industry.},

abstract={West Virginia University and the Council for Science and Technology of Queretaro, Mexico, have launched an Engineering School-Industry Outreach Program in which students and faculty from the USA and Mexico reciprocate visits in order to team up and "work together" in industrial projects in realistic professional settings. Students from both universities get credit from their home institution and are assessed based on their engineering performance on each project, despite the evident cultural, language and environmental differences between people, universities and industries from both countries. While the main objective is to bring an international dimension to engineering education a proactive approach brings new perspectives to industry and academia from which new lessons have been learned. For the participating students it was made clear from the start, that they would be assessed based on their engineering performance, as opposed to language proficiency, but they would be required to "communicate" and get across to get the job done in a timely and professional manner. The industrial exposure and the cross-cultural interaction between students, industrial practitioners and faculty from both countries, provided the frame for a rather rich experience, in which each participant has a meaningful role and a potential benefit to draw. Many lessons can be drawn. However, while the main benefits are yet to come, one thing is certain; the cultural differences indeed exist, yet, students in the USA and in Mexico share much in common and being able to overcome these differences was not only possible, it was highly rewarding and yes,...quite fun!},

abstract={Despite substantial increases in the number of women entering law, medicine, and business -fields previously dominated by men, there is still a scarcity of women in the field of engineering. Women continue to lag behind men in their enrollment into engineering programs and, consequently, in their completion of engineering degrees. At Oregon Institute of Technology (Oregon Tech) the disparity is especially acute in the engineering technology programs. One student-led initiative implemented to remedy Oregon Tech's situation was with a diversity action grant obtained by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) student club. The ASME students, working in conjunction with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) club, developed and administered a one-day conference designed specifically for female high school students regarding engineering careers. A successful program resulted that has helped to focus attention on possible reasons for the disparity of women in engineering technology. In addition, from the collaborative effort of the ASME and SWE clubs, strategies have been conceived for the recruitment and retention of women in engineering programs at Oregon Tech.},

abstract={The era of wild fight for new commercial markets has started after the disintegration of Socialist Bloc. So Economic Blocs have emerged in order to face this new global economy. In this context Mercosul has raised up in South America, which participating countries are Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The creation of this Bloc has a strong incidence in education, which is foreseen in the agreement signed by Common Market Council, which had place in Las Leñas in June of 1992. The plan proposed by the education ministries of the four Countries demands the application of a harmonic education system so that the instruction is equivalent in the four Countries. Taking into account this and other aspects of this new world the Engineering Faculty of University Center of Lusiada has elaborated an Engineering Course, which propose is basically the adoption of some subjects of Humanities and Social Sciences, among others. The chosen subjects are Philosophy, Human Resource, Development of Projects, Assisted Training Period, Management Strategies and since 1999 the subject Sociology was included to enrich the course principally because it is a Science that shows and discuss the main aspects of men life in Society. It discusses the importance of some social rituals for a living and the seeking for social justice. The goal is to form Engineers with good skills more creative, more critics and more attempt to the quick transformations in every aspect of professional life integrated to the new connected and global world. This experience has showed good results and has also brought up the changes in the way of seeing the Engineer as an agent of Science and Technology development for the well fare of humanity.},

abstract={The designing of mechanical engineering program at Alabama A&M university with a system approach was discussed. The curricular design included the practice of techniques for life-long learning by identifying learning levels of complexity. The concept for the new curricula was formulated with two specializations which the first included focus on manufacturing and the other one was geared to propulsion systems. The synthesis of recommendations for the new curricula in mechanical engineering had emnated from professional organizations like the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), National Research Council (NRC) and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).},

abstract={The goals of the Minority in Science Program Project, "Working in Teams to Enhance Pre-Engineering Curriculum" are encompassed in the overall objective of increasing the success of minority students in gatekeeper engineering and science courses. The mechanisms proposed to obtain this goal include the development of a number of instructional modules for pre-engineering and science courses that will specifically address many of the barriers encountered by minority students in these courses. A number of instructional modules are being developed for each of the following college level courses, that have been identified as gatekeeper courses for minority students: Calculus, pre-Calculus I, Physics, Chemistry, and four of the introductory engineering courses, Statics, Dynamics, Engineering Graphics, and Introduction to Engineering. Most of these courses are offered in community colleges that have pre-engineering and/or pre-engineering technology programs and serve a large number of minority students. This paper presents the conceptual design of the module format and the rationale behind this design. There are several unique aspects to the conceptual design of the modules that will be presented and explored in detail in this paper and presentation. Finally, examples from some of our first modules will be shared.},

abstract={Although considering the dynamic behavior of buildings and bridges is of fundamental importance in modern structural design, undergraduate civil engineering students seldom develop an understanding of the way that these structures respond when acted upon by time-varying loads. Because this topic is of great social and economical importance, there is a need in current civil engineering programs to provide more formal training in structural dynamics and earthquake hazard mitigation at the undergraduate level. Further, many students in non-engineering disciplines would gain from such exposure to basic concepts in earthquake engineering. The University Consortium on Instructional Shake Tables was formed to integrate earthquake engineering into the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum. The twenty-three universities forming the consortium are cooperating to develop a series of "hands-on" experiments for students at all levels. The experiments focus on the use of a bench-scale shake table. This program is expected to serve as a national (and international) model for integrating structural dynamics and earthquake engineering into the undergraduate curriculum.},

abstract={Design for the environment (DFE) is an essential tool for manufacturing companies to become competitive in today's global market. In the past, economic and technological decisions were solely based on market and profit outcomes, and little consideration was given to environmental and social impacts. With the increase in public awareness, pollution and health concerns become an important factor in today's engineering practices. Engineers and technologists familiar with DFE tools can positively impact company's market share and profitability without sacrificing sustainable development. The ISO-14,000 standard will soon become the common standard among international corporations as a result of the world's market rapidly moving towards globalization. Companies will embrace this standard similarly to ISO-9,000, which has gained broad acceptance among US and international companies. The DFE principles and practices are necessary tools for achieving major components of the ISO-14,000 objectives. Presently a large number of engineers are not trained in DFE practices. This situation creates some resistance to the implementation of DFE tools in product, equipment, facility and process design. Introducing DFE as a core course for all engineering and technology majors is central to the solution of this problem. We propose a core course that incorporates topics such as life cycle analysis; environmental impact assessment, just in time (JIT) concepts, concurrent engineering, and application of DFE tools as the design solution for efficiency, profitability, sustainability and lean manufacturing of environmental friendly products.},

abstract={Senior design capstone projects frequently require team members to self-organize for a project and then execute the design/build portion within a resource-constrained environment. This is usually challenging for inexperienced students who are struggling with technical as well as program management and team building issues. This paper outlines a general framework that can be used by students and faculty advisors to outline goals and objectives and to facilitate communication among team members. Key to student projects is how the student team leader communicates vision for project accomplishment, organizes the project and then ensures team members fully understand their contributions and major performance objectives. Once performance objectives and individual responsibilities are fixed, team members can use the framework as a guide to resource, design and build the project. Since each team member has a vested interest in a specific aspect (subset) of the overall project, program management is aided. If properly used, the framework will facilitate communication among team members and minimize confusion normally accompanying an inexperienced team. Faculty advisors can also use the framework to mentor students and ultimately evaluate student performance for grade assignment. This system was used to design and build the United States Military Academy Sunrayce vehicle (solar powered car), a large multi-discipline project that spanned a two-year design/build period.},

abstract={Current technological advances are emphasizing the need for cross-disciplinary training and expertise. The technology for managing information is transforming the manner in which information is captured, processed, stored, and disseminated. A catalyst to the development is the need for timely information by administrators, technicians, businesses, and the public in general. One application where cross-disciplinary expertise becomes evident is in the development and utilization of Geographic Information System (GIS). As a resource management and decision support tool, a GIS enables users to analyze spatially referenced data. The system depends, for its effectiveness, on the variety and volume of data that must be gathered. The effectiveness of the system is dictated by the use of computers and database management systems. These requirements imply that GIS analysts have to be adequately versed in Information Sciences and Technology (IST). Components of an IST program that meet the requirements in GIS are information management and data communications. Proper acquisition, analysis, and handling of information are critical in making the information useful to decision makers, as well as, other users of the information. Computer technology and database management support such applications. Training of personnel in GIS should cover topics in both geography with reference to the population, and information systems with a healthy concentration in computer technology. Penn State University has initiated an IST program and it is intended to make GIS one of the course offerings.},

abstract={This paper describes the innovative masters and certificate program in the Engineering Management (EM) program at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC). The EM program is a very challenging Master of Science program in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at UTC. The program is designed for people with engineering, science, or technology backgrounds who have moved or expect to move into areas of managerial responsibility. The EM program is going to be moved toward a degree, which is offered in both a traditional and non-traditional learning environment. As the program evolves, courses that are offered in the EM program would be developed using learning modules. Each course will be structured to contain a number of learning modules and these modules will emphasize different topics within a course. Based on this approach, students can enroll the EM program as degree seeking graduate students pursuing the Master of Engineering Management degree in either traditional or non-traditional mode. Further an individual could enroll as non-degree seeking students in one or more modules seeking to increase their expertise in one or more specific areas of a particular course. This paper will describe the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to course structure and delivery.},

abstract={The current paper describes the design, development, and evaluation of self-paced multimedia modules that are used in an advanced General Education course at San Jose State University. The design and development cycle of these modules began in 1994 and continues to this date. The General Education course, Technology and Civilization (TECH 198), is designed to introduce students to the realm of history and usage of technology in society and to increase their awareness of both the uncertainties as well as the promises of the utilization of technology as a creative human enterprise. During the summer session 1999, the completed modules were field-tested in one section of the class with fourteen students. The students were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 completed the multimedia module on Unit 1 (The Nature of Science and Technology) and group 2 completed the multimedia module on Unit 2 (Technology and Work). When comparing performance on pre-test and post-test measures, this study produced inconsistent results. For Unit 1, there was no difference in student performance when comparing the multimedia-based instruction with the traditional classroom instruction. In fact, the students taking the multimedia-based instruction for Unit 1 did significantly worse on the posttest (t = 2.457, p = 0.022) than those students in the traditional classroom. The results from Unit 2 differ from those of Unit 1. For Unit 2, both groups had significantly higher scores on the posttest than on the pretest. Also, Group 2 performed better overall on the posttest than did Group 1 although the difference was much less than the difference for Unit 1 (Group 1 Mean = 7.7 and Group 2 Mean = 8.4). This result would indicate that, for Unit 2 at least, the instruction by self-paced multimedia was as good as the "traditional" classroom instruction.},

abstract={It is important for engineering students to consider the effect technology has on society, yet standard engineering courses are usually purely technical in nature and do not grapple with difficult issues such as questions of resource use, side effects, ultimate goals, and purpose. While engineering courses sometimes ask broader questions concerning how technology affects society, students often do not get an adequate understanding of the "big picture." In order to fully address such questions, engineering students need more than just technical skills. They must understand concepts relating to the fields of sociology, psychology, philosophy, and economics to name just a few. They must also be able to make appropriate value judgements concerning the technology they design. Science fiction considers the most important questions about technology. A course based on science fiction readings and films can direct the students towards a considered approach to engineering design and development of technology. Such a course provides multiple advantages. First, it can give the students leverage on their own culture. An effective way to understand one's own culture is to first look at a very different culture. Science fiction places the student in another world to examine important human conflicts, issues, questions, and desires. Second, science fiction provides a mental laboratory in which students can perform thought experiments with new technology. Third, a science fiction course can allow engineering students to interact with students in less technical disciplines. This cross-fertilization is often very helpful in working through issues of technology and its interaction with the human society within which it is embedded.},

abstract={Not only has the Internet gained a prominent role in the industry by revolutionizing commerce, information access, supply-chain management, entertainment and publicity etc but it is also quickly impacting engineering design and technical education. This paper describes the research conducted by the Engineering Media Lab at the University of Oklahoma in applying Java and VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) 1 for performing engineering design and analysis on the Internet. To demonstrate the potential of using VRML and Java for design and analysis over the Internet an L-shaped beam subjected to a point load along any or a combination of three directions i.e. X, Y and Z is chosen. The user can vary the length and height of the beam. For the sake of application simplicity the cross-section of the beam is constant. The user can choose the material properties of the beam and the loads to which the beam is subjected. After the user submits the values, the Java program generates the new L-beam, meshes the beam automatically and computes the 3-D stresses in the beam using the finite element method. The results are color coded and displayed on the screen. Thus the user can perform the design and analysis from any computer with an Internet connection in a virtual design environment with 3-D visualization.},

A volume monitor unit was chosen for the summer of 1998. A microphone was used to convert sound into electricity and then the sound is amplified. The intensity of the signal was then displayed using an LM3914N to drive a graduated number of LEDs. The project was produced in kit form containing a printed circuit board and circuit components as well as a battery and box. Throughout the project sessions, casual conversation provided the opportunities to discuss career options in electrical engineering technology as well as the educational path necessary to reach such goals.

abstract={Undergraduate students of Indiana University Southeast (IUS) and Purdue University collaborated to research the phenomena of natural occurring signals in the Extremely Low Frequency and Ultra Low Frequency ranges. Physics students of IUS fabricated coil antennas intended to receive signals from single hertz to approximately 100 hertz. The intent of the physics students research was to detect and analyze signals, especially those of terrestrial origin such as the Schumann resonances, lightning resonances, and the postulated electromagnetic signals that are pre-cursors to earthquake activity. Purdue Electrical Engineering Technology students designed amplification and active filter circuitry for the IUS physics students to use in their research. The Purdue students did this as a part of their RF and Power Electronics class. The relationship between these two universities respective programs proved to be mutually beneficial. The Purdue students had the experience of designing and fabricating a device which was put into immediate use. The IUS physics students supplied weekly feedback to the Purdue students on the signals that they had detected. The physics students gained a greater appreciation of electronics and the Purdue students an understanding of the physics under investigation. This project has proven to be interesting enough to continue on for three years and has received two grants from the Purdue Research Foundation. The present state of the research is briefly described.},

abstract={Engineering technology at Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT) today maintains a hands-on, practical mode that not so long ago characterized much of engineering education. Since 1967, the Technology Accreditation Commission of the ABET has accredited many colleges who now grant thousands of baccalaureate degrees in engineering technology each year. Recently, in response to a demand from the high-tech industry, OIT in 1995 created a new Master of Science in Engineering Technology. Ideally, we grant the degree after 4 quarters of full-time graduate work, including core courses in research methods, ASIC design technologies, data communications, and computer systems architectures. Of the 48 quarter-hours minimum required, 12 hours are for a project, the most important part of the program. Because OIT is not a research organization for doctorates, our terminal MS degree in engineering technology is considered first rate on this campus. Below we describe the program as it now exists, including case histories of our first graduates.},

All campuses have developed improved engineering curricula and learning environment models and have incorporated those models into their institutional fabric. As part of its strategic plan, the partner campuses in the Foundation Coalition have focused their efforts on improving their competence in seven theories of pedagogy; these seven pedagogical theories are referred to as the core competencies of the Foundation Coalition. The seven core competencies are 1) curriculum integration, 2) cooperative and active learning, 3) teamwork and collaboration, 4) technology-enabled learning, 5) assessment-driven continuous improvement, 6) recruitment, retention, and graduation of women and underrepresented ethnic minorities, and 7) management of change. Once proposed as core competencies, the Foundation Coalition must answer at least one question. What are the theoretical foundations that suggest these seven core competencies will positively impact engineering education? The paper will review the literature to provide the theoretical foundations that indicate increasing abilities in these seven core competencies will positive impact engineering education.},

abstract={BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) is a non-profit, community-based volunteer organization started in 1993 by a group of technologists in Sherman, Texas to systematically address the lack of public peer acclaim for academically successful K-12 students. BEST provides public recognition of these students' academic, technological, and problem solving skills by offering students a chance to compete in a sports-like engineering design contest, one that deliberately mimics a product design-to-market cycle. This paper will document the growth of the BEST local hub network from its inception in 1993 to its 1999 status of 14 local hubs in five states. Variations in local hub organizations will be discussed to illustrate the many ways that communities can implement a BEST contest. A detailed roadmap by which a new local hub can implement a BEST contest in its community will be presented, along with a description of the evolving nature of the BEST Robotics Inc. parent organization. The BEST program's positive effect on individual students, schools, and communities will be discussed, with examples of some significant changes directly attributed to BEST implementation in their locales.},

abstract={A common difficulty in teaching environmental site remediation is how to consider both hard and soft constraints in course design, in a fashion that leads to students being able to drill down to the core of problem and formulate their design accordingly. This paper describes how hard and soft constraints were addressed in engineering design using community-based, service learning (CSL) design projects. In the site remediation course at Tufts University, three design projects required the development of a remediation scheme for actual brownfield sites in Boston, MA. In their designs, students had to consider both hard (limited and conflicting contaminant information for site soil and groundwater) and soft (the viewpoints of the various community stakeholders) constraints. Based on student, faculty and staff feedback, the design experience carried more meaning and encouraged greater learning because it involved a real problem. Additionally, the experience extended student learning beyond the technical aspects of site remediation as a result of working and interfacing with people from a variety of interests and professional backgrounds. By including service learning in the course design project, the students then had a dual vehicle in which to refine their designs in ways that deepened their understanding and learning. From our experience overseeing this course, we conclude that to truly realize the benefits of service learning, integration of CSL throughout the curriculum is needed along with better management of service learning components.},

abstract={The Foundation Coalition was funded in 1993 as the fifth coalition in the National Science Foundation's Engineering Education Coalitions Program, and is currently in the seventh year of a ten-year project. The member institutions have changed since its formation and now include Arizona State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, the University of Alabama, the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth, and the University of Wisconsin. All campuses have developed improved engineering curricula and learning environment models and have incorporated those models into their institutional fabric. As part of its strategic plan, the partner campuses in the Foundation Coalition have focused their efforts on improving their competence in seven theories of pedagogy; these seven pedagogical theories are referred to as the core competencies of the Foundation Coalition. The seven core competencies are 1) curriculum integration, 2) cooperative and active learning, 3) teamwork and collaboration, 4) technology-enabled learning, 5) assessment-driven continuous improvement, 6) recruitment, retention, and graduation of women and underrepresented ethnic minorities, and 7) management of change. Once proposed as core competencies, the Foundation Coalition must answer at least one question. What are the theoretical foundations that suggest these seven core competencies will positively impact engineering education? The paper will review the literature to provide the theoretical foundations that indicate increasing abilities in these seven core competencies will positive impact engineering education.},

abstract={In the search for ways to simulate "real" design experiences in our classrooms, the model of service learning is often overlooked within engineering. It is, however, a powerful model for learning the engineering design process. At Purdue University the EPICS - Engineering Projects in Community Service - program is doing just that. Under this program, undergraduate students in engineering earn academic credit for long-term team projects that solve technology-based problems for local community service organizations. The program currently has 20 project teams with approximately 250 students participating during the 1999 academic year. Each EPICS project team consists often to fifteen students and is paired with a local community service organization that functions as its customer. Each team has a faculty or industrial adviser. The teams are interdisciplinary including students from Electrical, Computer, Mechanical, Civil, Aerospace, Industrial and Materials Engineering as well as from Computer Science, Chemistry, Sociology, Nursing, Visual Design, English and Education. The teams are vertically-integrated each is a mix of freshman, sophomores, juniors and seniors - and a student can participate in a project for up to three and a half years. The continuity provided by this structure allows projects to last for many years. Projects of significant size and impact are thus possible. Four projects are highlighted to illustrate the multidisciplinary aspects of the program. The projects selected illustrate mechanical, civil and electrical hardware and software design in the context of service learning.

The intent of the course is to expose students to real world design projects. Students are expected to be creative and innovative in their design projects and utilize a multitude of engineering disciplines that Engineering Technology Program offers at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. The objective of this project was to use a 68HC12 Motorola micro-controller to control a three-axis motion of a milling machine. This micro-controller was chosen because it has multiple inputs/outputs, built in 8-bit analog to digital converter and timer, pulse width modulator, 16 bit I/O bus, and on board flash memory. In this project, student designed an interfaced circuit to micro-controller and wrote a program in assembly language to control the motion of each stepper motor that is responsible for each axial.},

abstract={Not a single Engineering Technology doctoral degree-granting program could be located in the United States by the authors. Therefore, it could be argued, and has been, that the master's degree is the terminal degree for Engineering Technology. In many programs located at doctoral granting institutions, a doctoral degree is either implicitly or practically required for tenure and promotion. Two recent national studies, conducted by the authors, indicate a near drastic shortage of Engineering Technology faculty for four-year colleges and universities. As a result, some institutions are "solving" this problem by requiring only a masters degree - knowing that most individuals who posses only a masters degree have not completed a thesis - and, in many situations, are expecting these people to compete in a university's research-dominated environment. For those graduates that enter or remain in industry, degree requirements that are based solely on completion of courses without the requirement for the student to conduct and report on a meaningful applications-oriented project may result in graduates that are not representative of the mission of engineering technology. A possible solution is to require a thesis that emphasizes application research in every masters degree program in Engineering Technology. Beginning in 1994, the Engineering Technology Department faculty at the University of North Texas approved a thesis-only masters program.},

The NASA PaSCoR program is outcomes-based and student centered, focused on hands-on learning activities provided throughout the student's academic career. The program's outcomes will be a graduate that is knowledgeable of the technology and applications of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS), and, possesses the necessary skills either to enter graduate school or becomes a professional in these areas with success. The program also aims at developing values such as diversity, teamwork, global awareness and communication. PaSCoR goals will be achieved through five tasks, namely: 1) curriculum development, 2) undergraduate research & student mentoring, 3) industry collaboration, 4) outreach, and, 5) assessment. This paper describes the curriculum development strategy and expected major outcomes.},

abstract={This paper describes the importance of the alternate learning approach, which is Web-based course delivery in the Engineering Management (EM) program in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC). The EM program at UTC rests on the principles of bridging the gap between engineering and business. This program provides a vide variety of aspects in engineering management such as quality, reliability, product design, human resources, cost analysis, technology, and strategy. The program has a high demand from engineers who are currently working in the Chattanooga and surrounding areas. However, increasing work demands, necessity for travel, and/or relocation and job changes prevalent in the business environment make participation more and more difficult for individuals. Therefore, the EM program wants to offer an alternate and innovative learning environment for those individuals who want to enroll in this program.},

abstract={Communications technology is revolutionizing Higher Education as it adapts to the new telecommunications technology to provide formal education through distance learning using the Internet. Due to this paradigm shift, several universities in the United States (Georgia Tech., Stanford, Penn State, etc.) are delivering entire degree programs primarily at the graduate level, through the World Wide Web. Primary beneficiaries of this new technological approach are the students who can work through the course at his or her own pace and in their own space provided they have access to the WEB. The major challenge that needs to be addressed by higher education institutions is how to motivate faculty members to embrace this approach. Faculty buy-in is essential to engage in distance learning through Internet at any institution. The least resistance path to stimulate faculty may be to provide less cumbersome technology to prepare and deliver the course material. This paper discusses the CourseInfo management tool used at Arizona State University to create and maintain online courses and course supplements.},

Interactive-engagement activities were introduced into lectures and conducted by students. Students were also assigned term projects to propose science activities based either on a lecture activity or on a topic within the student's own major discipline or extracurricular interest. Activities were required to be cross-disciplinary and of direct relevance to study within a discipline other than science. From among more than eighty student contributions, eleven science activities and experiments are summarized, which may accompany a course in visual studies foundations for art majors.},

Now, the Manufacturing Engineering Technology curriculum is able to further incorporate design, production, and testing in concurrent engineering and student projects. This paper discusses new developments in a Tooling for Plastics Processing course that focuses on the design and construction of injection molding tooling where the students investigated several methods of creating prototype tooling from RP models. Each method was evaluated for tool and part characteristics including surface finish, cycle time, cost, repeatability, and tool longevity. These methods can also be utilized in subsequent courses to create tooling and manufacture parts for design analysis and testing. Using RP, students are now better able to perform multiple iterations of production and testing of advancing designs using RP. The level of learning that occurs is dependent on two main things: how much iteration occurs and how well the results are analyzed and utilized in the next or concurrent step.},

This course is the combination of a miniature land rover vehicle with sonar-type sensors that scurries around on the floor mapping out its surroundings while avoiding obstacles in its path. It is the newest member of the group and links student learning to the use of exciting projects compared with more traditional mundane cookbook experiments. It examines the fundamental reasons for learning while comparing and contrasting different types of learning styles and how educators and teachers motivate students to their best.},

abstract={Understanding or predicting the consequences of a specific action or circumstance is especially difficult in the case of environmental issues, which exhibit several forms of uncertainty. Many natural systems such as the atmosphere or oceans, however, appear to be inherently chaotic, and their evolution through time is uncertain. The inevitability of uncertainty in dealing with environmental issues is compounded in terms of industrial ecology that must integrate a changing technology with two sets of complex systems, namely the environmental and the economic. In most cases, the uncertainty is defined and managed through evaluating and quantifying risk. In this paper, a method of systems approach has been used incorporate design into environmentally conscious design and manufacturing (ECDM) course. A systems approach design model has been developed for environmental auditing for manufactured products starting from raw material extraction to the final disposal of the manufactured product. The design criteria are the methods by which the environmental friendliness or customer requirements are met in the design arena. In addition to the basic design requirements for environmentally conscious design and manufacturing, sample case studies have been provided in order to elucidate the concepts covered in ECDM course. The design content adopted in this paper, emphasizes a proactive approach to environmental management that requires that the concept of environmentally conscious manufacturing (ECM) be integrated throughout the company's management structure and the production system.},

abstract={A set of hands-on laboratory projects has been developed for undergraduates who are not majoring in science or engineering. The projects are intended to help explain the principles of physics to non-science majors. The projects explore both the technological and scientific aspects of familiar technological devices, and demonstrate how technology incorporates a scientific understanding of nature. All projects result in tangible evidence of accomplishment such as construction of a simple radio, a loudspeaker, a one-octave electronic keyboard, and a compact disc-to-cassette tape adapter. The projects are made from inexpensive and simple materials so that each student can take home the working device. It was expected that projects which the students take home serve to amplify the impact of the work to include peers and family members. None of the projects require specialized equipment or facilities, and all of the projects can be modified to suit different institutional circumstances. General characteristics of the types of projects that were found to be effective for the target audience of non-science students are also summarized.},

abstract={Stevens Institute of Technology recently revised the Engineering Curriculum to include an expanded design course sequence, having a design course each semester to form a Design Spine. The Design Spine allows development of many of the "soft skills" demanded of engineering graduates, as embodied in ABET EC Criteria 2000, by evolving them over the four years of the design sequence. Examples include effective team skills, project management, communications, ethics, economics of engineering, etc. It is also a means to enhance learning, as each of the design courses is linked to engineering courses taught concurrently. Students see this strong linkage for the first time in the second semester of the freshman year when they take Mechanics of Solids concurrently with Engineering Design II. Mechanics of Solids is a four-credit lecture/recitation course that integrates the topics of statics and strength of materials courses that were taught separately in the previous curriculum. In the two-credit Engineering Design n course, students undertake a series of four experiments and two design projects to reinforce concepts from the mechanics of solids lecture course through hands-on experience. The main objectives of this approach include integration of design and other engineering practice skills (according to ABET EC Criteria 2000) into engineering mechanics and improved teaching of engineering mechanics to freshmen. The main components included in this integrated teaching approach and a preliminary assessment of its effectiveness so far are presented.},

abstract={In recent years there has been a rapid growth in interest to integrate technology into the engineering curriculum, both to extend the reach and effectiveness of teaching and learning, and in response to industry needs. We have conducted a survey of engineering faculty at the eight SUCCEED coalition universities to identify the training needs and present levels of experience with various technologies. The results of that survey are presented here, with an emphasis on the variations between faculty rank and the institutions' emphasis on teaching or research The results showed that, as a coalition, there is little variation between faculty rank (Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor) with regard to either (1) faculty skill level, (2) current use of various technologies, and (3) faculty willingness to attend technology workshops. When the data was further segregated according to whether each institution's main mission is research or undergraduate teaching, the results were unchanged for faculty skill level and current use of each technology. The only observed difference between research and teaching institutions was that a higher percentage of Associate and Full Professors at teaching institutions are willing to attend technology workshops, while Assistant Professors at either institution type are equally willing.},

abstract={At Kettering University (formerly GMI Engineering & Management Institute), three conditions reduce the effectiveness of how the engineering design process is taught, especially in capstone design courses: 1) fragmented approach to teaching design, 2) short quarter system (11 weeks of instruction), and 3) alternating work and study terms required by, and essential to Kettering's cooperative education program. As a potential solution, with help from NSF and several interested industrial partners, a design environment called λTotal Design Studioλ has been set up at Kettering University. Here, all necessary tools for conducting a complete design cycle have been gathered under one roof. Access to CAD software and internet has been provided. A few key technologies, such as rapid prototyping and imaging systems, have been incorporated into the studio as well. As phase one, a capstone design course has been given use of the facilities. The impact of the studio on the students' design output has been qualitatively evaluated. Also, the advantages and the drawbacks of introducing high technology into undergraduate environment have been documented. As phase two, two alternative plans have been developed to expand the design activity from one term to two terms in order to avoid the current time crunch. Of course, both these plans include design activities to be performed over the work-term when the students are at their sponsoring companies. These plans will be evaluated for implementation in the near future.},

abstract={This paper is concerned with the philosophy behind development of a new course Computer Simulation of Metal Forming Processes at Kettering University (formerly, GMI Engineering & Management Institute) in Flint, Michigan. Kettering University has a unique undergraduate program that requires all students to go through a 5-year co-op experience beginning in the first year and a required fifth year thesis. In talking to several co-op company advisors and based on advising several fifth year thesis students for the past two years at Kettering University, it is becoming apparent that validation of virtual forming outcomes of intricate and complex sheet metal parts with real forming is rapidly gaining importance. This is particularly true in the early stages of product and process design, because of the high cost and time associated with real forming using hard tooling. Students working in this or similar virtual product and process design areas need to be trained in order to meet the demands of such industries. In a class room environment, however, the use of virtual forming is enhanced by demonstrating that the virtual process provides solutions very nearly identical to the real process. In order for the students to have instant feedback of virtual forming technology, real forming by use of hard tooling is necessary and crucial for their proper understanding of the forming process itself. It is believed that no other school offers a course coupling at the undergraduate level that combines both virtual and real forming. The ultimate goal of this course coupling is to bridge this gap. Initially, however, product and process design in the area of sheet metal forming is addressed.},

abstract={This paper concentrates on executive level Masters programs (MS) in MoT, TM and EM. Executive level MBA programs were excluded. Programs were selected based on an extensive literature search, searching published directories and a survey of program directors. These searches did not uncover any "official" definition that clearly defined executive as compared to advanced or basic level Masters programs. An initial screening classified a program as executive if the program required at least five years of business experience and/or the students enrolled had an average age of at least thirty. This resulted in 11 programs. A survey was then sent to the program administrators asking them to rank the criteria that they thought constituted executive or advanced level. The survey confirmed that an Executive Level Masters program in TM and MoT could be defined by the admission requirement of at least five years of work experience and advanced course work. As a consequence of a 5-yr. minimum work experience requirement, the student body average age would be at least 30 years old. Another criteria is the self-designation of the program as executive, particularly in schools or universities with other "basic" programs. While all programs required some combination of GRE / GMAT and / or undergraduate GPA, the surveys indicated that this factor did not distinguish basic from advance programs, but was rather a general requirement for all programs. Neither company sponsorship nor engineering or science undergraduate degrees were factors that distinguished advanced or executive level from basic programs. While it is common for EMI programs to have engineering and / or science undergraduates, no Engineering Management program made the executive level list.},

abstract={The electrical engineering senior capstone laboratory course is meant "to provide the electrical engineering senior student with additional and varied experiences in creating and designing working electrical/ electronic/ electromechanical systems, from specifications to prototype product". At Mercer University we have structured this course such that in addition to design stipulations, it addresses a number of other EC 2000 requirements, specially, those listed under criterion III; "Program Outcomes and Assessment". In particular, attempts are made to expose the student to a number of important features of engineering profession in the 21 th century. Specifically, three important issues of globalization of engineering practice, the need for life-long learning, and the role of technical communications skills are addressed in this course. Moreover, the design of an engineering experiment is included in this course. In this article, following a detailed account of the structure of this course, we provide a list of several design projects that have been selected for this course. A sample design project on fabrication and testing of a simple AM radio receiver is described in some detail. Finally, a sample on "Design of an Experiment" is referenced briefly.},

abstract={The statement has been made that "the students now entering Engineering Technology have spent the last 15-18 years with interactive video, educational rock, and VCRs." Anecdotal experience indicates that they have spent considerably less time with erector sets, with lawn mower engines, with the use of tools, and the exploration of the fundamentals of mechanical and electrical structures. This statement would suggest that we, as evaluators and educators, would need to change our approach to teaching Engineering Technology in order to gear our programs to that of our customer's experiences and expectations. But do we need to do this? Although the buzzwords today are on computer simulations, virtual reality, etc., I do not feel that the needs of the "real world" have changed. There is still a need to be able to have that "hands-on" experience that only an Engineering Technologist has and can bring to the work force. To this end, laboratory experiments should be laid out in such a manner as to duplicate a "real world" situation. These experiments should be designed so as to build on the previous experiment, just as classroom lectures build on one another, and arrive at a "real world" application. This way, students will gain experience in seeing how a complicated design is built up of many simple circuits. A set of laboratory courses, which are presently used in the Electrical Engineering Technology program at the Purdue University School of Technology site at Columbus, will be presented to show how this has been achieved.},

The development of the Rowan Engineering Curricula began in 1994 and included the input of an advisory committee of technology industry leaders. The coursework and laboratories were planned and are being implemented with a strong component of industrial partnerships and industrial experiences for students and faculty. Rowan has taken a multi-faceted approach to academic/industrial partnerships. Rowan faculty teaches courses on company sites. Many of these courses are designed to meet specific needs of industry and always include industrial input. These courses have a project component that allows participants to use the course content in an application that is relevant to their work. The development and implementation of university/industry designed courses have been especially successful for experimental design and statistical process control and analysis courses. Industrial projects with experimental work completed at a company site or at the University are also an important part of learning and research opportunities for faculty and students. Academic/Industrial project partnerships leading to important learning and research opportunities are a critical component of Rowan Engineering Programs. Especially noteworthy are those partnerships involving undergraduate/graduate project teams. These opportunities lead to enhanced learning for students and strong support from industry for academic programs. Studies of powder flowability as a function of particle size and reengineering of toner cartridges have been especially successful.},

abstract={Cross-functional and multidisciplinary teams are increasingly common in business and the marketplace. Industry has migrated from a parochial view of disciplines to a broader view of teamwork as an effective means of increasing the creative capacity of the organization. As a reflection of this industrial need, the ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC 2000) require that graduates of our engineering programs must be able to function on multidisciplinary teams (criterion 3(d)). Most existing educational programs provide little training for undergraduates in the skills necessary to function effectively on such teams. In our new "Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing Laboratory" (MBL) course, we have developed formal training exercises and intensive laboratory experiences that help our students develop multidisciplinary team skills. While the MBL course is focused on biocatalysis, the concepts and approaches used for instruction and training are generic and may be applied to a variety of interdisciplinary technology areas. We will discuss the course structure and give examples of exercises used in the classroom.},

abstract={The National Science Foundation recently funded the proposal "Statics: The next generation. "This project incorporates proven pedagogical findings to improve teaching of statics, specifically, and engineering courses in general. Using past and current research, twelve "Next Generation (NG) Principles" are proposed for enhancing student learning. These principles include incorporating active cooperative learning, service learning, writing assignments, technology, high standards of learning and teaching, and a learning support system for students. These principles are being used as a basis for teaching two sections of statics at North Dakota State University (50 and 100 student enrollments) and one section of 22 students at Arizona State University East during the fall semester of 1999. This paper describes the NG principles, their implementation in these statics sections, and initial results. The fundamental intent in using NG principles is to enable high-performance student learning and encourage faculty and students to be active partners in acquiring, constructing, and transforming knowledge.},

abstract={SCALE-UP is an extension of the highly successful IMPEC project (Integrated Math, Physics, Engineering, and Chemistry), one of NC State's curricular reform efforts undertaken as part of the SUCCEED coalition. Basically, we are utilizing the highly interactive, collaboratively-based instruction that worked so well in smaller class settings and finding ways to economically accommodate classes of 100 students. Relative to students taught in traditional classes, SCALE-UP students are better problem solvers, achieve nearly four times the gain on certain conceptual tests, have better attitudes toward science, and report greater satisfaction with their instruction. Retention rates for females are twice those in regular classes. Technology is used to provide a phenomenological focus for students, allowing data collection, analysis, mathematical modeling, and advanced simulations. As student attention is drawn into analyzing different physical situations, teachers circulate around the room and engage students in Socratic dialogs. Lecturing is minimal, primarily for motivation and to provide an overview of topics. Use of WebAssign, a web-based problem delivery and grading system, ensures that students have reviewed the textbook before attending class. This technology also permits students to conduct peer evaluations of each other's work. This poster presentation describes some of the different protocols we utilize to facilitate group functioning; including group member selection, contracts, team self-evaluations, scoring to promote participation by the better students in group activities, requirements for team presentations, etc. Examples of evaluation forms, activities to introduce the benefits of teamwork, and teacher guidelines will also be on display.},

abstract={Investigations of job advertisements in regional newspapers revealed a high level of demand for Computer and Network Support (CNS) positions. An in-depth analysis of employer expectations within the CNS field provided a checklist of knowledge requirements and skills. A subsequent analysis' of 3 rd year computer science students, both at Edith Cowan University (ECU) and internationally, revealed that they did not possess these necessary background skills - there was a mismatch between demand and supply. As a result two new first year single semester units, Computer Installation &amp; Maintenance (CIM) and Network Installation &amp; Management (NIM), were designed and implemented at ECU. Both CIM and NIM are regularly oversubscribed, attract students from a wide range of disciplines and also cross-institutional enrolments from other universities within Western Australia. Significantly these new units have a substantial 'hands on' component consisting of a weekly workshop and associated lecture, both of 2 hours duration. Both units assume some knowledge of physics including basic electric circuits. A questionnaire based upon basic electric circuits was administered to CIM students in 1998 and the results clearly demonstrated that most students lacked sufficient physics in this area to fully support their learning. Given that students must work in a potentially hazardous environment, a knowledge of physics is also essential in understanding the principles behind Health &amp; Safety. Furthermore, some students experienced difficulties with respect to formula derivation, manipulation and substitution. The importance of a basic knowledge of physics, particularly as a foundation for understanding technology and its curriculum implications are discussed. Possible solutions to students' problems with basic physics are presented.},

Often these individuals manage technical contributors or work closely with engineering functions in the company, and as a result, would like to improve their management success probability in the high technology environment through technical management education. We find professionals in customer service, production planning, marketing, and sales that fall into this category in a typical company. In addition, we even occasionally have an interest from individuals from non-traditional engineering organizations such as physicians and biologists. To serve this population we have recently created a Professional Certification in Engineering Management. This certification broke new ground on the Boulder campus being the first of this type to be approved by the Graduate School.},

abstract={Study of kinematics and dynamics of machinery involves very challenging mathematics for engineering technology students who typically take this course at their junior level in a 4-year baccalaureate curriculum. Although mathematics is an essential tool for designing and analyzing mechanisms, this heavy burden in mathematics carries a risk of taking students' attention away from developing the important fundamental concepts of kinematics which are truly beneficial in their future practical technical work. This paper describes an attempt at WSU to develop an experimental kinematics and dynamics course such that students learn the subject from concept and experience. In this method, students are first challenged to solve kinematics problems through the computer simulation software Working Model without knowing the underlying mathematical tools. In this challenge, students will improve the simulation results through trial and error and their own approaches. In most cases, they will realize that the perfect solution has to be obtained from an approach they do not yet know. This challenge will provide them with the experience to develop a concept of each kinematics problem. Only after this challenge, will students be exposed to mathematical approaches to provide perfect solutions to challenge the problems. Finally, they will try another set of simulations using the mathematical approaches they mastered and verify the validity of the mathematical approaches.},

abstract={Presently there is a general assent that for the future the new professional has to have some extra abilities to be able to compete in the new global work market. The world has started a new era, the era of global economy where technology and scientific knowledge are moving the world development in a very fast way. Now the professional competence is measured not only by the work that a man can realize but also by the results that he gets. And so extra abilities can make a difference. Thinking about this we have conceived and developed a new kind of Engineering course. This work is the description with some details of the Engineering Course of the Engineering Faculty of Catholic University of Santos, in which the students have to develop projects since the first year of the course. In this scheme of education the students can count with a Professor/advisor to help them during the process of elaboration of the projects. Their projects are showed in a Congress that happens every year around November. This is a new kind of education that we have named Scientific Introductory Project and that added by Lab works provide the students at least five projects of experience that means more research skills, self confidence and leadership habits. The Mercosul reality has also influenced our project that takes in account the necessity of giving the students a more generalist formation viewing the South America work market.},

abstract={In Criteria 3 of ABET 2000, portfolios are identified as one method of documenting and assessing student outcomes. Portfolios offer several advantages in outcomes assessment(multiple samples of work over time, a view of learning and development, etc.), but their disadvantages (problems with storage and administration, security concerns, etc.) must be balanced against those benefits. In implementing the RoseE-Portfolio at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, the faculty, administration, and students have confronted these issues; the result is a web-based portfolio system that focuses on a student's "best work" and requires a "reflective statement" in which a student demonstrates the relevance of the work to the learning outcomes objectives. This article outlines the stages of the RosE-Portfolio development from the initial concept to its testing through a Pilot Project and the current status of the plan. In offering the results of the project thus far, the authors offer suggestions on how other institutions may gauge the appropriateness of a portfolio system to their own student learning outcome goals.},

abstract={The World Punkin' Chunkin' contest is a yearly affair of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Lewis, Delaware. Department of Technology students entered the competition with a human powered, 20 ft long sling-shot type device and won the first place by throwing an 8-lb pumpkin 246 feet away. The design of a pumpkin thrower was assigned to three Mechanical Engineering Technology students as a project for senior level "ETME 475 - Mechanical Systems Design" course. As a first step, each student worked on their own pumpkin thrower. During the final phase, students worked on the design and manufacturing of the different parts of the project. During the early Fall semester one student, with faculty supervision, worked on the project to redesign the pouch and tune the system. Students from the Engineering Society have also helped to set it up for tests and decorations. Competition day was of course a Department affair. Students enjoyed working on this good engineering applications project. The Project required them to use their mathematics, machine design, computer programming, engineering analysis and reasoning, and dynamics knowledge. This paper conveys our experiences with the project, shares my experiences in how to guide students towards a common goal in a systems design course and how to lead them to finish the project on time.},

Seventy-nine of the 192-quarter credit hours of OSU's College of Engineering (COE) consist of IME courses. One consequence of the traditional evolution of the curriculum has been the evolution of a self-selection process where the majority of students that select and stay in engineering are those who fit the engineering culture. Reflecting back on the changes and the process to achieve them has helped engineers to prepare for the new accreditation requirements contained in the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) 2000.},

In an effort to expose students to real-life work experience, the Department of Engineering Technology of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the New Jersey Building Contractors Association have developed a partnership over the past fifteen years to offer summer internships in the construction industry. The scope of the program is a twelve-week placement of the student in a construction firm. During this period, the students are mentored by the contractor, a representative from the New Jersey Building Contractor's Association and a department representative from the New Jersey Institute of Technology to assure that the student is exposed to the full range of activities of a construction firm, both in the office as well as in the field. As the program has reached its fifteenth year of participation, the results of past and present participants have been reviewed to offer and insight to the positive and negative aspects and impacts of running an internship program.},

abstract={Academic institutions are notorious for their resistance to change. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has been a leading proponent for the need to effectuate fundamental and systemic change in this country's engineering education system. To that end, it has funded numerous "Engineering Education Coalitions" consisting of a number of engineering colleges at different institutions working together to remedy the perceived shortcomings in the engineering education system. The volume of change and innovations that have resulted from these coalitions is phenomenal as can be seen by accessing their home pages via NSF's web site (www.nsf.gov). Developing and proposing change is, however, a different matter from implementing it and managing the change process. At a recent Innovators' Conference hosted by NSF, a workshop was held on factors of importance in institutionalizing change 1. Although a number of factors were discussed, there was no specific prescription on how to organize and create the changes in the first place. This paper will describe how the principles of engineering management were employed to temporarily reorganize a large College of Engineering and Technology to accomplish a specific set of tasks. This reorganization, based upon the principles of matrix management, resulted in a complete re-engineering of the College's programs and curricula. The results, achieved by faculty working in cross-functional teams are now institutionalized in the catalog and being executed. More importantly, the results were achieved in one academic year.},

In particular, the findings suggest that both undergraduate and graduate students believe that 4 areas have been incorporated into the civil (construction) engineering program at a high level. These include: mathematics through calculus and differential equations, structural engineering, major design experience or course, and geotechnical engineering. In addition, 1 area, construction management, has been rated at a high level by graduate students.},

abstract={This paper discusses common concerns about and various techniques for the teaching of Computer-Aided Design (CAD). One of the concerns raised will be related to how engineering technology students can acquire the necessary CAD skills for use in their design projects. Also discussed will be the relative advantages of different approaches, such as having CAD as a separate course, making CAD a part of design or graphics courses, and allowing students to acquire the skills on their own. Classroom lectures for the teaching of CAD software are examined and compared with self-learning by students. Another aspect to be addressed is project assignments. In addition to regular CAD drawing exercises, practical CAD design projects as well as traditional question-and-answer homework are assigned to students to enhance their understanding of the subject and to improve their CAD skills. Also, the proper mixture of CAD theory with hands-on experience, as well as the proper levels of general guidelines and specific instructions, is reviewed. In addition, the paper discusses the degree of complication that freshman CAD projects can have without overwhelming students and examines the introduction of practical exercises, such as machine parts with correct dimensioning and scale, early in the curriculum. Quizzes, written exams, and term projects are evaluated as to their usefulness in assessing the amount of understanding and skill that students have attained. Finally, the paper gives examples of the relative merits of different CAD software packages in an educational setting and raises other issues such as modem teaching equipment and the proper time to be given for the completion of projects.},

abstract={An assessment of the effects of a multi-disciplinary first-year engineering course was conducted at the University of New Haven during the spring, 1998. It is the students' first exposure to engineering and probably their first meaningful design experience. It starts with engineering applications and concepts in problem solving, and ends with introduction to design. This is the first place the student is introduced to industrial quality design tools through the use of design environment that provides such features as simulations, animation and virtual laboratory. The assessment tools for this course include course profiles, classic tests, projects, oral presentations, written reports and student surveys. Two surveys were conducted during the semester, one at the beginning and one at the end of the semester. The first survey was designed to measure student perceptions about themselves and their skills in several topics such as mathematics, computer usage, and team and communication skills. The second survey was designed for outcome assessment of achieving the course objectives and the level of increasing their skills. The assessment results show a very strong correlation between student satisfaction measured by the survey and active experience in the classroom. The assessment of the course by students has led to increased hands-on projects, multimedia technology usage, computer simulations, and assignments linked more closely to real-world applications.},

abstract={At a time when the design and construction industries are aware of the increasing use of the Design/Build project delivery strategy, there is little attention to its implementation in architectural or construction management programs as a classroom experiment. East Carolina University Department of Construction Management and the University of Oklahoma Department of Architecture began the investigation for such programs in their curricula. This research presents the development strategies created to instigate an Internet Design/Build class for the two schools. The paper relates the positive and negative components confronted during the development and implementation of the overall class. Using available computer information technology resources, such as NetMeeting and MIRC32, the Design/Build class approach of study emphasizes the management of design, construction, planning, finance, and marketing, as well the absolute need for communication between the team members. Rather than face the traditional confrontation of the parties, this class is intended to strengthen the professional bonds, complementing each partners' strengths and thereby creating a strong TEAM approach to design and construction. The implications derived in developing this program show the need for such investigations in other schools of construction and architecture interested in pursuing a relevant and emerging domain of education. This study recognizes the need for the existence of Design/Build and its integration and acceptance into professional programs.},

abstract={Engineering Technology programs are designed to provide students with the technical skills and critical thinking abilities to become successful professionals. In today's evolving market, the success of our graduates will depend on their ability to solve not only the current problems of their field, but to anticipate their future needs. Employers demand professionals with broad knowledge, not limited to technical issues. If a few years ago the basic mission of the graduates from Engineering Technology programs was the repairing and maintenance of equipment, today their role has evolved into being involved in technology management. These requirements from industry reflect in academia, as the survival of Engineering Technology programs is closely related to producing graduates that can satisfy what is required from industry. This paper presents approaches to bring industry closer to the students. The main goal of these activities is to teach the students the culture of the workplace. We want to address issues such as the importance of professionalism, the importance of writing, the need for communication with other professionals, etc., beyond the merely technical contents that are the basis for their future careers. This knowledge makes them to become more successful in their professional careers.},

abstract={For the past two years, the Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at the United States Military Academy has been improving a multi-disciplinary design course called EM370, Computer Aided Design (CAD). Based on student feedback and advances in technology, goals were established to ensure the computer design tools were compatible with the top-down design process and that the course content and Engineering Design Problems (EDPs) were linked by a common theme. In 1998, the department began coordination with the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) to use the weapon as a thread of continuity to show how all the topics taught in EM370 are related to real-world problems. The new series of ATACMS EDPs demonstrated how design information could be shared in a collaborative engineering environment. Moreover, the course improvement project included an opportunity to incorporate the way the Department of Defense (DoD) uses top-down design in the acquisition process. Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) is a proposed system to apply top-down design and ensure that product data can be transferred across all the phases of the acquisition process. One of the main goals of the SBA initiative is to develop collaborative environments to speed the design process. In order for the initiative to succeed, the engineers across all disciplines must understand its goals and work to improve the way we develop weapon systems. Student assessments showed that the collaboration effort including the ATACMS and SBA improved the course content, instructor performance and student outcomes. Additionally, EM370 could serve as an educational baseline for other multi-disciplinary undergraduate CAD courses and the Defense Acquisition University curriculum.},

abstract={Students from Engineering Technology Programs should be able to work as members of Project Teams with Engineers to help find solutions to technical problems. Come and learn the methodology for problem solving by participating on a project team to derive solutions to an actual electromechanical design problem using a hematology analyzer from industry. This exercise will utilize the methods actually used by a project team from a Biomedical Instrumentation Corporation in which both engineers and technicians from various disciplines participated. The steps involved will consist of the following: 1. Determine the nature of the problem and create specifications. 2. Brainstorming to compile a list of possible solutions. 3. Select three best possible solutions. 4. Sketch one of the solutions. 5. Suggest ways to test solutions. This method can be used in any number of technology courses and will help the student prepare for problem solving and working in a team environment.},

abstract={The availability of faculty with academic credentials is never a problem when engineering technology programs cast their net. Unfortunately, most of the catch must be thrown back because they lack industrial experience, thus not meeting the basic credentials requirement of TAC of ABET. The other side of the coin is the lack of stability caused by three employment factors: the return to academe of very experienced industrialists, the retirement of long standing professors, and the departure of young scholars to seek their fortunes in the competitive industrial environment. This paper describes faculty transition problems and offers solutions that lead to better stability within engineering technology programs.},

abstract={The mobile robotics course introduced at the University of Missouri-Columbia is similar to other robot-building courses, with one important distinction - instead of competition among student teams, cooperation and information sharing are encouraged across all students in the class. The course covers the design and development of intelligent machines, particularly emphasizing topics related to sensor-based control of mobile robots. Students are grouped into teams of 2-3 people, representing multiple disciplines. Each team is assigned a robot kit, which includes a small micro-controller board, motors, sensors, and technic lego parts. Programming projects using the kits are designed to stimulate creativity and exploration. The first three projects are structured to promote incremental progress, culminating in the completion of a small, autonomous mobile robot. At the completion of each project, each group gives an oral presentation and demonstration and also submits a written report that becomes part of the lab manual. For the final project, the class collectively designs an experiment on cooperative robots, redesigns the team robots as necessary, and conducts the experiment. Throughout the course, the class operates in a cooperative spirit. Students are encouraged to discuss ideas and problems with each other, even members outside of their group. Using a technique developed by another student or group is also acceptable as along as the developer is credited in reports and discussions. The cooperative class spirit has proven to be a good environment for individual learning and at the same time promotes teamwork. Student productivity, as well as student satisfaction, has been high.},

abstract={The University of Southern Mississippi created the Workforce Training and Development Program within the School of Engineering Technology at the request of the State Workforce Development Council. In parallel, the School of Engineering Technology also expanded its Masters Degree program to include emphasis areas in Workforce Training and Development and in Environmental Safety. From inception, faculty members working to develop these programs recognized that building close ties with business and industry was important to the long-term success of these new programs. The authors adopted a four step approach designed to involve business and industry in the process of program development. The first step was to define the role that industry should play in the development and growth of the programs. The second step was to identify and contact companies which would be interested in committing their time and talent to program development. The third step was to actively involve business and industry personnel while developing opportunities within industry to augment student education. The final step was to cement the relationship with the industrial partner and to develop long-term commitments to program development. Within the first year, this approach has succeeded in developing solid relationships with business and industry. Members of business and industry have offered support by participating on the Industrial Advisory Committee, establishing paid internship positions, hosting field trips, hosting large group projects, assisting with networking with other businesses, and advising on technical course content. These efforts have combined to create a stronger undergraduate and graduate curriculum while being more responsive to the hiring needs of regional business and industry.},

abstract={The benefits of company sponsored student design projects, both to academia and to industry, have been well established recently in symposia and in publications. In spite of these known benefits many institutions have been slow to implement student projects with industry. Much of this reluctance has been due to the perceived difficulties of the administrative tasks necessary for arranging and planning these matches between student teams and company projects. Admittedly, in preparing project activities, there are numerous administrative tasks that transcend normal teaching responsibilities but if these tasks can be clearly outlined in advance then they can be made manageable and can lead to effective design education experiences. It is the purpose of this paper to identify the necessary steps for soliciting, screening, and selecting the types of company projects that will enhance educational objectives and further industrial partnerships.},

abstract={In most schools, a department deals with a discipline and usually the various aspects of that discipline. This is also true for Engineering Technology. However; the department often doesn't stop at the various aspects of the discipline. It continues across boundaries to other fields of expertise, such as mechanical to electrical. The organization of this unit is often treated as a single department and is determined by the size of the student body and the number of faculty in each area. This type of unit is rarely seen in Engineering and involves management of various disciplines by people not experienced in those disciplines. This leads to many students and faculty not being well served within their area of study or expertise. The disciplinary content of these units is discussed along with the types of managerial organizations being utilized. Pros and cons of the various organizational structures are discussed along with correspondence to program size. Finally, some comments will be offered to help alleviate some of these problems.},

abstract={Fair and useful assessment of student abilities is often a difficult task. Ideally, evaluation instruments should assess how well the student has understood material directly presented (knowledge and comprehension), how well the student can apply this information to a new problem (application), how well a student can distinguish and relate the component parts of a topic or argument (analysis) and how well a student can extend his/her learning to new areas (synthesis and design). These four skills represent different, progressive, levels of understanding, that fall along an abridged hierarchy as that outlined in Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives 1. This paper describes a method of designing in-class exams and take-home projects for a freshman computer science course. Here, the design of the test questions and project requirements makes explicit use of this abridged version of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. The in-class tests described in this work evaluate the depth of a student's understanding by incorporating a planned variety of questions, ranging from those easily answered by a student who has understood basic lectures and reading to problems requiring novel application of basic tools. Based on the degree of difficulty of the questions answered, students are graded according to a deterministic criterion (as opposed to, e.g., scaling based on class averages). The take-home projects also employ a deterministic criterion that indicates precisely what is expected of the student for each of three performance levels: passing (C), good (B) and excellent (A). An important feature of this design is that the instructions for the lower level work are more detailed and require less student innovation, whereas the instructions for A level projects offer less direction.},

abstract={This paper presents our experiences while developing computer based instruction (CBI) materials for an Electrical Machines course for the NSF-funded Greenfield Coalition (NSF-GC) for new Manufacturing Education. Greenfield Coalition for new Manufacturing Education is a partnership of six diverse educational institutes and five manufacturing companies, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers and Focus: Hope, a civil rights organization that serves the Detroit community. The Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT) is Focus:Hope's multi-level training facility. Greenfield Coalition was conceived to develop an innovative manufacturing technology and engineering curriculum. The electric machines course introduces industrial electric power sources and industrial applications of motors, generators, and transformers to associate level manufacturing engineering and technology students. The course is developed from an industrial electric systems perspective rather than from an electric circuit perspective. The goal of writing this paper is to partially enable future developers of CBI material, especially in mathematically intensive courses, to understand the dimensions of such developments. This project involved developers, specialized in electrical engineering, responsible for the technical content, an industry partner to provide feedback and inputs on material relevant to manufacturing, instructional technologists to insure ease of visual learning, specialists to help in devising modes for assessing learning of CBI material, graphic designers to create professional drawings and figures, multimedia specialists to develop animations based on written descriptions of the developers, and authoring tool experts to develop the material on Authorware and Flash screens.},

abstract={It seems like every recent education conference has a significant amount of discussion on the need for tying together educators and practitioners by either educators practicing or practitioners educating. The value of incorporating practical application is clear to both educators and practitioners, but is it clear to the students? The purpose of this study was to question students in the application-oriented field of Civil Engineering Technology and Construction Management and get their view of having practitioners in the classroom. More specifically, students' views of the importance or value of having professors who actively engage in professional practice in addition to their teaching duties were explored. The questions were few and straightforward with a chance for general comments as the last question. This study was used to determine the students understanding of the need for real world knowledge on the part of the faculty. If the understanding was there, responses to the questions could be used to refine this practice with the students interests in mind. If the understanding was not there, steps would be taken to clarify this point to the students early in their educational career. This paper will present the results of this study and suggestions to enhance the concept of professors as practitioners. The questionnaire was also distributed to a Civil Engineering program to determine the difference in perception of this concept in an Engineering Technology program and an Engineering program.},

abstract={Learning styles have been discussed for years as an approach to enable engineering education to become more effective. However, even though many successful applications have been documented, there has been scant scientific evidence of its effectiveness. At the same time, there are many benefits in using asynchronous tools to complement in-campus classes as well as in distance education. However there is concern that these tools will not be as effective as traditional lectures. This paper reports on a study 1 that was performed at the University of Missouri - Rolla, which successfully measured the impact of one of the learning styles to engineering students. It utilized a web site that contained three tutorial learning modules. These modules were designed for asynchronous application and with varying degrees of global and sequential content in their learning environments. Thirty-two graduate and undergraduate students participated in the study, which became a part of an established engineering course. The students were tested for their learning styles as well as their knowledge of the material before and after each of the Internet-based tutorial sessions. The results of the study showed that the student learning was no worse than in previous classes, which had covered the same material without the help of the asynchronous tutorials. This implies that educators can use more Web-based educational content in their classes with confidence that it can be effectively managed. In addition, it was found global learners learned better in a global environment and sequential students learned better in a sequential environment. This gives more choices to educators on how to reach their students and ways to improve learning effectiveness.},

abstract={This paper describes the successful evolution of a course in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit) design. While a decade ago, it was acceptable for a first-semester course in VLSI design to emphasize only MOS transistor theory, process technology, physical layout, and circuit issues; this exclusively low-level approach to teaching VLSI design is no longer in the best interest of the majority of students. Some claim that since the use of hardware description languages, standard-cell libraries, and high-level synthesis are becoming so widespread in industry; emphasizing low-level circuit issues benefits only a few students. Long-time teachers of VLSI often counter with the claim that while perhaps valid, what is really being offered is a course in system design and not in traditional VLSI design where the emphasis should be on full-custom methodology. Hence, it has been our observation that, in practice, the majority of introductory courses in VLSI focus on one methodology, while treating the other in a cursory manner. This paper will demonstrate how we successfully teach everything from MOS transistor theory and CMOS process technology through circuit and logic design, up to and including the design and synthesis of digital systems using a hardware description language in a one-semester introductory course in VLSI design.

The title of the proposal was "Engineering Design Graphics Summer School 1999: Planning the Engineering Design Graphics Curriculum for the 21st Century." The project proposes to establish a team of highly-motivated Engineering Design Graphics faculty who will work together and devise a plan that will serve as a modern curriculum guide for Engineering Design Graphics. The inaugural event will consist of a Summer School to be held in the Summer of 1999. At this school, participating faculty will convene to discuss major issues, form sub-committee teams with specific assignments, and return to their home institutions to work on their specific parts of the curriculum plan. Interaction amongst the committees will be conducted through email and internet, and ideas will be discussed and tested in the classroom setting. The group will then reconvene for short 2-day meetings in the 1999-2000 era to finalize the curriculum plan. The results will then be published in a Monograph in time for the year 2001. The monograph will serve as a comprehensive EDG curriculum guide, and will be distributed to all college faculty who are identified as teaching Engineering Design Graphics, as well as to all Engineering and Technology Deans.},

abstract={One alternative to a long term-paper assignment in a technical writing course is the short memo. Engineering technology students enrolled in Ms. Ford's sections of Technical Writing, English 202C, at Penn State University - Altoona College are required to write a number of memos and short reports in response to case studies. These case studies are designed to approximate the types of writing students will be doing in their careers. When English instructors work together with engineering faculty, they can write more realistic cases and can build upon skills the students are learning in their engineering technology classes. Similarly, engineering faculty can consult with the English instructor to incorporate memo and report writing skills into the students' engineering projects. This paper reports on efforts by the English and engineering faculty members to complement each other's assignments so mat students will acquire skills in both engineering and communication. Sample cases are presented.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of a new computer-based course in Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines, designed for students pursuing BS degrees in Manufacturing Engineering Technology. The course development was based on the premise that basic science and engineering principles are best understood by demonstrating their practical applications. This was the foundation for the detailed learning objectives used throughout the course. The course was divided into modules, each of which first introduces candidates to observable practical applications of kinematics in a manufacturing setting. After these practical examples are investigated, students extend their learning to the more theoretical and analytical concepts. The complete curriculum has been implemented in computer based multimedia form, allowing for individualized self-paced learning. This includes numerous animations and simulations that allow the student to interact with the computer, ask "what if" questions, and get perspectives that would be difficult to show in the absence of a computer. The course also includes a computer-based simulation project integrating the concepts covered in the earlier modules. The first delivery of this course is planned for Fall 1999.},

abstract={Since the fall of 1990 Engineering Technology at the University of Central Florida has offered courses utilizing the videotape lecture successfully demonstrated by the FEEDS (Florida Engineering Education Delivery System) system. Primarily using UCF campus and community college locations, this system allows for maximum viewing freedom of the course material via tape without geographic or work schedule constraints. Emerging communication technologies (electronic mail, web forums, and the World Wide Web) offer enhancements to the current educators' delivery system. These courses are delivered in an asynchronous manner, which gives the convenience of students being able to work when and where they wish and the students can also control somewhat the pacing of instruction. Traditionally in the FEEDS model interaction between teacher and student has not been considered. Yet interaction is considered to be the key to effective learning and information exchange. Some of the interaction techniques now included with the course materials are: Electronic mail World Wide Web Scavenger hunt Delphi Process Virtual teams World Wide Web Forum discussions The basic technical management course has been using these technologies as additional resources. The textbook used for this particular course is Daniel Babcock's Managing Engineering and Technology, although the resources and techniques may be used for a variety of management courses. This paper presents resources and tools that may be used to enhance the management functions, product life, and personal management discussions. Since the resources are not static, the web listings will give a starting place for future explorations.},

abstract={Assessments used to improve the quality of education have recently been stated by ABET in its EC2000 list of A-K outcomes with similar criteria proposed by TAC. A difficulty lies in quantifying and documenting the assessment of these outcomes. From another perspective, employers typically use performance reviews which depend on assessing an employee's performance in a similar manner. Students in MET curricula who do not commonly use these assessment techniques and may enter the work environment ill-prepared. This paper reviews two examples of incorporating student assessment into MET/Manufacturing Option classes. In an Applications of Strength of Materials class, students prepare a report of mechanical characterization test results, and grade/rank each other's reports. Statistics are used to assess the effectiveness of their criteria and weighting system, and the feedback provides a means to improve their skills. In a second example, a CAD/CAM class is organized into 'companies' which assign job descriptions, get RFP's, create proposals, and carry out a phase II contract. In this process learning environment both company and student performance is reviewed and includes the use of peer assessment. Periodic assessment of company reports and individual journals encourage the student to improve themselves.},

abstract={The traditional method of presenting Engineering Science and Engineering Technology courses emphasizes theoretical derivations and applications of formulas to solve practical problems. While this method is effective, it does not provide adequate visual aids to reinforce the students' understanding of the subjects. The visual component of most lectures consists of manual sketches on the board or projected images. Very often, the quality of these visual aids is unsatisfactory. In addition, the static sketches are unable to represent motion. In order to improve student understanding and visualization of the course material the authors have modified their courses to include the Working Model© software. This paper describes how this software has been integrated into three Mechanical Engineering Technology courses at the University of Cincinnati and Miami University at the freshmen, sophomore, and junior levels.

abstract={Practicing engineers need to develop a career plan to ensure that they can meet the challenges in the evolving global workplace. The academic foundation established by an engineering degree may launch a professional career, but individuals must take a proactive role in their professional development activities to permit career advancement. This task is becoming more crucial as international conglomerates continue to establish manufacturing plants around the world. Engineering activities on "world" products are often performed at multiple design centers located in various countries and are staffed by nationals. To facilitate the design and manufacturing processes, frequent teleconferences and electronic mail are necessary between these centers, as well as periodic international travel to explore technical issues. To successfully compete in today's global engineering market, individuals must develop and follow a career plan. The key elements include a life-long learning plan to maintain and expand technology skills, the ability to embrace continual workplace changes, the gaining of international skills, and a crucial need for professional engineering registration. In this article, some of the major workplace issues facing engineers are discussed with recommended steps to ensure that their skills and contributions maintain pace with engineers around the world throughout their careers.},

abstract={SPECTRE - the Student-run Program for Exoatmospheric Collecting Technologies and Rocket Experiment, is a sounding rocket experiment in NASA's Student Launch Program. Electrical and computer engineering seniors have worked on the flight hardware as a continuing capstone design project for five semesters, as part of an interdisciplinary student project team. Students have faced rich technical problems and unique project management challenges arising from the multi-team, multi-semester nature of this senior design effort. The need to interface regularly with other students, multiple faculty, staff engineers, and NASA review teams injected real-world pressures into the design course. This paper discusses the structure of the capstone course, the SPECTRE technical goals, and team experiences managing this complex evolutionary design problem. Substantial extended design can be successfully attempted within a capstone course if management continuity is maintained and if student teams develop effective communications and provide good engineering documentation for their successors.},

abstract={The growth and expansion of the Internet has created opportunities and a need for exploring Internet technologies in a classroom setting. Techniques such as remote procedure calls which were established more than a decade ago are being revisited as client-server networks become popular. Developers are also scrambling to build Java based applications that can be deployed on any desktop. In the last offering of our data communications course, we did a pilot study and made some changes to our traditional offering of this course. The focus was more hands-on experience, exposure to modern technology, and less on theory. The classroom setting was informal and projects were group-oriented. In this paper we describe two projects that were assigned during this offering. The first project uses Java to build a client-server application and attempts to compare the tradeoffs between Java and C++. The second project is an extension of the local programming paradigm. The students build a network file service protocol using remote procedure calls.},

abstract={This paper describes the Masters of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM) program at Florida International University (FIU). The MSEM program at FIU emphasizes a practical, systematic, and programmatic educational environment that will enable future managers of engineering and technology to become technically competent and business-practice oriented. Prior to its implementation, a survey of potential students at local industries was conducted to measure the demand of the Engineering Management program. A split result was found in the preferred way of delivering the proposed program: while 47.4% of the potential students prefer an in-campus education, the other 52.6% favor distance learning. As such, all the MSEM courses are delivered through asynchronous education (videotapes) in addition to the traditional synchronous education (classroom). At FIU, graduate students in MSEM gain knowledge through traditional engineering lectures, guest speakers' presentations, and through study and discussion of related cases and articles. The Case Study teaching methodology, which encourages students to learn from others, presents a challenge in terms of involving the asynchronous students. This paper presents some of the techniques used to overcome the challenges of delivering education through this medium. Some of the techniques presented include the implementation of the MSEM Decision Room and the use of Internet classrooms.},

abstract={Evaluations of existing undergraduate engineering programs continually cite three weaknesses: graduates lack technical literacy; graduates lack oral and written communication skills; and graduates lack design experience. To address these weaknesses, the School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science (CEES) at the University of Oklahoma, is proposing a systemic reform initiative that will incorporate four themes throughout the curriculum. The centerpiece of the initiative is a common design project, entitled 'Sooner City,' that will be introduced during the freshman year and continue for the entire curriculum. Design tasks range from population estimates to the water supply system. A common design project can unify the curriculum and allow material learned in early courses to carry forward. Another advantage is that the students will have a professional design portfolio that can be presented to perspective employers. Second, the design project will be taught using the just-in-time learning paradigm. By focusing on real-world applications up front, students will be interested and motivated to learn. Third, courses will be restructured to incorporate team learning and group presentations, which enhances the students' interpersonal and communication skills. Fourth, starting in Fall 1998, all incoming engineering freshman will have a laptop computer with wireless communication technology so that each classroom becomes a networked computer lab. Together, the efforts will produce graduates who are self-disciplined, responsible, computer literate, and who can communicate effectively with fellow engineers, management, and the public. Also, the reformed curriculum can serve as a template for other reform efforts around the country, with an obvious name change for the city!},

This means programs must carefully consider and identify where in the curriculum attributes are addressed and taught. This can be facilitated if educators have a means for understanding and managing the curriculum as a whole. In the mechanical engineering department of Brigham Young University, we have been experimenting with ways to capture and manage the curriculum to insure that all desired attributes are addressed. We discuss what we have learned to date and the strengths and weaknesses of the methods we have tried. We discuss a web-based software tool for curriculum management that is currently under development. The software will enable us to manage curriculum to insure that all attributes are being developed and to maximize integration across courses. It will help provide consistency in instruction, will be a complete repository of the curriculum that can be accessed at any time, be a catalyst for interaction with outside 'suppliers' such as math and physics, and be a means for communicating program objectives to students.},

The technology is available to make the needed improvements, but financing is usually a problem. The answer to those facing the expense of making improvements that can slow the rapid demise of our natural resources and reduce energy usage is Energy Savings Performance Contracting (ESPC). ESPC is an option for funding infrastructure improvement projects to improve building performance and maintenance rather than wasting dollars on cosmetic changes or improvements that do not solve energy problems. Without taking steps to cut energy usage or to update inefficient existing systems, our adverse effect on the environment will continue. Approaching energy management on a commercial level can effect energy savings, economic savings, pollution reduction, and conservation in the form of upgrading, updating, and upscaling existing facilities.},

abstract={Six years to tenure seems like an eternity until the last year approaches and much is yet to be accomplished. A sudden surge of activity at the end of the tenure trek is 'normal', as most new professors spend too much time getting started. This is especially so when there is a research program that must be established before the refereed papers can be produced. And, of course there is the teaching aspect of tenure. In teaching colleges the path is different but requires planning and careful management just as it does in the research institutions. The key to success is a fast start that eliminates the first year syndrome, where satisfaction over landing a job buoys the new professor until the realization hits that this is a small step in a lifetime career. This paper addresses the fast start from three levels; Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA), Director of Engineering Technology, and the new Professor. It addresses the plan proposed by the VPAA, the execution of that plan by the Director, and the efforts of the Professor to accomplish the myriad of tasks that will help in the tenure process. It involves direct communication among the group, and a mentoring plan to assist the new Professor. It requires each responsible agent to get involved to assist in the success of the program. It is not an assurance of success, but it helps all parties begin the evaluative process early, to avoid disasters that deny tenure to good people and tenure some who might otherwise be less qualified.},

abstract={One of the most critical aspects of the new ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC-2000) is the existence of an outcomes assessment plan for program evaluation and continuous improvement. Outcomes assessment requires the generation of assessment tools or instruments to gather data that will document if a program's stated goals and objectives are being met and if students have acquired identified skills. In 1994, a partnership of universities - called the Manufacturing Engineering Education Partnership (MEEP) - initiated the design and implementation of a novel undergraduate manufacturing program, better known as the Learning Factory. This paper describes how MEEP designed the assessment strategy to evaluate the curricular innovation project outcomes, and presents some of the assessment instruments/tools designed. The tools developed, some in collaboration with industrial partners, were utilized for assessing overall and specific qualitative aspects of the program as well as student performance (e.g., teamwork skills and oral presentation/written skills). A total of 9 assessment instruments are presented. We believe that the Learning Factory as well as the project's assessment strategy and tools used comply with the new ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC-2000).},

abstract={Technical innovations, coupled with the divestiture of AT&T and deregulation of the telecommunication industry, as a whole, has significantly altered the exciting field of telecommunication.

Trained telecommunication professionals are currently in short supply and the-long term career opportunities are very encouraging. Careers in this field include telecommunications engineering and management, public policy, consulting, research and development, vendor sales, marketing, and technical support. In responding to this opportunity, the Engineering Technology Department at New Jersey Institute of Technology developed an undergraduate telecommunication concentration within the Electrical Engineering Technology program. To keep abreast with the market space and the demands of the industry, we developed an assessment plan used as an input to the program improvement process. Included in the assessment plan is a survey sent to the graduates of the telecommunication concentration to track their progress and to gain an insight to the strength and weakness of our program. In this paper we present a summary of our program, followed by the design of the survey and the data analysis of the returned survey results. We also include the steps we have taken in response the graduates feedback.},

Discussion of how the soil mechanics laboratory was developed, funded and instrumented is included. A series of NSF/WV EPSCoR grants were utilized to fully develop this laboratory. Consolidation, hydraulic conductivity, direct shear, triaxial shear, unconfined compression, and data acquisition equipment was purchased, instrumented, and incorporated. Each test setup can be monitored through an elementary computer/data acquisition interface. Raw data is collected via the data acquisition system which is controlled by the HOST Management System. Data can be reduced manually or automatically using GEOSYSTEM computer software developed by Von Gunten Engineering software, Inc. One of the obvious benefits is time management; for instance, students can begin consolidation tests, collect data 'through the night' and apply incremental loading the next morning while obtaining a full night's sleep. Discussion of the funding mechanisms, development difficulties, and benefits of using data acquisition and associated software in the undergraduate environment for CET courses will be provided.},

abstract={The pedagogy of service learning has been documented since the mid-1970's (Perry, 1970), but only in recent years have colleges and universities begun to integrate curricular-based service into higher education. During the fall of 1996, the Department of Construction Technology, IUPUI; NBD Bank, Indianapolis; and the Concord Community Development Corporation (CCDC), teamed up for an innovative undertaking in community partnership. The pilot project involved the rehabilitation of an abandoned, three-room house located near the IUPUI campus. Students enrolled in a senior level design course elected to tackle this project in lieu of the traditional `Semester-End Design Project' required in the class. This paper will describe some of the lessons learned from this pilot project and attempt to provide a blue print for the integration of similar community projects into the engineering technology curriculum.},

Cogeneration systems installed on university campuses generate a portion of the total electric consumption with the exhaust heat used in bottoming cycles to provide other effects such as cooling through the use of chillers. Cogeneration systems also provide ways of managing energy costs as well as replacing older technology with more environmentally-friendly hardware. Like many other systems, decision on such a major investment depends on rate of return and market forecast of utility price fluctuations.},

abstract={Each year the National Science Foundation (NSF) receives nearly two thousand proposals vying for one of its Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) grants. Roughly 500 of these proposals seek support for engineering laboratories. Each year the NSF gathers together several hundred professionals, most of whom are educators, who review the proposals and recommend which should be funded. The NSF reviewers are grouped into panels, each consisting of about six members. Each panel reviews and ranks 15 to 20 proposals. Since only about one in five proposals receive funding, each panel can expect to have the NSF fund only their top three or four. Interestingly, most proposals are weak and easily denied funding. This paper explains why this is so and gives clear, specific advice on how to ensure that your NSF/ILI grant proposal can have its best chance for funding. Most of the advice offered here will apply equally well to all types of NSF grant proposals.},

Each EPICS project team consists of seven to ten engineering students. The teams are vertically integrated - each is a mix of sophomores, juniors and seniors - and a student can participate in a project for up to three years. The continuity provided by this structure allows projects to last for many years. Projects of significant size and impact are thus possible. The goals of the EPICS program include: providing students with multi-year, team-based, design and development experience; teaching students, by direct experience, how to interact with each other and with customers to specify, design, develop and deploy systems that solve real problems; and showing engineering students how their expertise can benefit even the most disadvantaged members of their community.},

abstract={Development of knowledge and expertise in the design and use of experimental techniques is critical in engineering technology curricula. Consequently, the effective use of experimental equipment and facilities is very important. In the School of Technology at Arizona State University, a closed circuit subsonic wind tunnel with a 4×5 foot test section capable of speeds between 30 and 200 ft/sec is maintained primarily for teaching wind tunnel testing techniques to Aeronautical Engineering Technology students, as well as students from other engineering technology disciplines. This paper describes the development of this facility and a course that is taught at the senior level in the Aeronautical Engineering Technology program in wind tunnel testing. Although the wind tunnel is the most important experimental tool of the aerodynamicist, there are many other applications that allow the incorporation of the facility into the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Technology curricula. For example, the wind tunnel has been used for many non-aerodynamic purposes such as studies in heat transfer, wind loads on structures, and automotive applications. Consequently, as will be described, students from all engineering technology programs at ASU utilize and benefit directly from the facility.},

The apparatus was installed in January of 1996. This is being followed by six months of training in solid modeling and use of the equipment, as well as finalization of early implementation plans for the Polymer Processing and Computer Integrated Manufacturing classes in the summer and fall of 1996. These plans will begin as part design information along with mold design requirements, derived and gathered by Polymer Processing students, are fed to students of Computer Integrated Manufacturing. Upon interfacing with the Polymer students, and equipped with SLA requirements, CIM students will develop appropriate solid models for prototyping. The development of permanent molds by students of metal casting is planned for long term. Plans for the use of this apparatus in pre-college programs is also planned for, with vision toward developing small focus groups comprised of faculty, graduate students, undergraduate students, and prospective students. Young people will be exposed to modern rapid prototyping technology and how it is implemented within an actual manufacturing system. It is expected that in the future, the addition of stereolithography to GMI's Polymer Processing/Computer Integrated Manufacturing laboratories will provide current exposure to manufacturing systems engineering for GMI students and inspiration in the area of Manufacturing Systems Engineering (MSE) to young people considering further education in this field.},

abstract={In face of recent global competition, a significant paradigm - agile manufacturing - is emerging, where multiple firms cooperate under flexible virtual enterprise structures. To address manufacturing education needs to promote and understand agile manufacturing concepts, a unique graduate level course is being offered at the Department of Industrial Engineering, SUNY-Buffalo. This graduate level course covers topics, enabling techniques/technologies, and case projects in agile manufacturing. It provides a core set of fundamental tools, example applications and open research topics. The objective is to expose participants to agile manufacturing issues, and enable them to creatively synthesize and apply the tools covered to open research problems. It blends quantitative and qualitative material, from multiple disciplines of industrial, manufacturing and management engineering. The specific objectives of this paper are to discuss the design and experiences of this course. Further, it is our desire to share the motivation behind the relevance of such a course, and some of the challenges in designing and offering it. We would also like to propose some possible directions in which academia could focus so that a skilled and empowered manufacturing profession base can be created.},

abstract={The primary purpose of administering tests and conducting laboratory projects is twofold: (1) to measure the degree of the students' learning and comprehension, and (2) to enhance learning. Often, the first intended outcome is attained but the second purpose is ignored. The most prevalent testing procedure is to schedule or announce a test and give the students some idea what material will be included. The students then study the indicated material hoping they will be prepared. Usually, they do not know what type of questions they will encounter so their studying is more generalized than specific, or they may try to memorize everything using their short-term memory ability. Each individual student then completes the written test document. The test is graded by the instructor or assistant, and several days later, the scores are posted using some confidential method. When time is not allocated for students to review the test to learn which specific questions may have been answered wrong, the learning aspect of test administration is defeated. Often, laboratory and experiential projects are treated similarly. Once they are graded and returned to the students, many days may have passed and the course topic area has changed. Time is not normally allocated for review of the project results.},

This course represented to many a step backward in educational methodology since it incorporated a practicum (a workshop) during which students performed design and analysis exercises under the supervision of a preceptor. The course format has remained relatively stable over the past 8 years. However, the topics covered in the course have evolved with the understanding of the concepts of DFM/A. Further, the method by which each topic is taught has changed over these years. A historical perspective is drawn describing the paths trod in the evolution of this course in an effort to stimulate a discussion of both the topics and the methods for teaching DFM/A. The present format of the course includes two lecture sessions per week and one two hour practicum session per week. In the present form the DFM/A course includes: DFM Methodologíes Overview, Break-Even Analysis, Process Analysis, Design for Function, Design for Assembly Principles, BDI-DFA Manual Methodology, Creative Concept Development, Design for Automated Handling, Value Engineering, and Group Technology.},

abstract={This paper describes a new course being developed in aerospace manufacturing technology. The course was offered for the first time in the Spring of 1996 as a senior/graduate level elective for Aerospace and Ocean Engineering (AOE), Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME) students. We are developing the course in response to industry requests that aerospace engineering students learn about manufacturing. The purpose of the course is threefold. First, it serves as an introduction to manufacturing for AOE students. Second, it permits ISE students and ME students to extend their knowledge of manufacturing into an industry specific area. Finally, it brings together students with design and manufacturing interests into a common, focused course to discuss interrelated issues. The course was to begin by focusing on the product -- a design of a specific aircraft. (More will be said about this later.) Next, various manufacturing processes and technologies were introduced and discussed with respect to individual components and subsystems of the aircraft. Industry is helping us to develop case studies illustrating the manufacturing processing sequences associated with particular components. The lectures then focuses on manufacturing cost analysis and cost drivers in aerospace manufacturing. This was followed by a discussion of the manufacturing environment as an integrated system. Finally, concepts in design for producibility were addressed in light of the materials already presented. Laboratory demonstrations, field trips, and a term project served to reinforce class material and provided the students with some hands-on experiences.},

abstract={This is an updated report of the VISION (Vision of Industry and Schools In Ongoing Networks) project based in Howard County, Indiana. The program, which aims to improve mathematical and science skills of K-12 teachers, combines the efforts of local industry, academia, and the county schools. The teachers perform hands-on exercises at participating industries and receive related instruction on technical and curricular matters from the two local universities. The teachers receive a stipend and three graduate credits in education for completing the program. Improvements were made in the 1995 VISION project based upon lessons learned from the 1994 pilot. These included increased instruction time from faculty members of Purdue and Indiana Universities, especially in the areas of statistical control, quality management, biology, and physics. A second change provided the teachers more time to both reflect upon the industry experience and prepare the required instructional module. VISION 95 attracted more teachers, more industry partners and received funding from an Eisenhower grant. The major goals of the program continue to be increased teacher knowledge of technical careers and assisting teachers in preparing their students for technical education and careers. For Purdue and Indiana Universities, the goal of participation in the project is to attract higher quality students into the areas of math, science, engineering and technology through increased teacher awareness. Future goals include finding additional funding sources and expansion of the program beyond Howard County.},

The course meets once a week for three hours, and is team-taught by two faculty members, one with background in materials science and the other with background in manufacturing and design. Course activities aim to create a discovery-oriented learning environment, and the weekly activities are geared towards helping students to successfully carry out a design project involving press-forming/press-shaping. Students engage in hands-on activities to investigate the relationship between structure, properties and processing of materials. They apply some general concepts of manufacturing to design the dies for press-forming/press-shaping, and use AutoCAD and a model computer-aided milling machine to cut a prototype die. They use statistics for product description, tolerance, and properties. Students also make final design project presentation. Details of the course and results of student evaluation are described in the paper.},

However, while most of these students are well founded in the basics of structural analysis and design, many have not been exposed to the trials and innovations of engineers and architects who have dealt with these issues throughout history. In addition, few students have been exposed to intuitive methods of structural design.

abstract={The development of construction education curricula has undergone several significant changes over the last several decades. Existing construction programs fall primarily under two categories, construction engineering and construction management programs. Further, construction education is significantly different at the undergraduate and graduate levels and within engineering and non-engineering-based programs. The original emphasis of construction education has been on planning, scheduling and estimating. Construction Management education emphasizes the qualitative and administrative aspects of construction such as law, resource management, and finance. Construction Engineering education emphasizes the quantitative aspects of construction including materials, equipment, and operations. In the latter, the recent trend has been towards an increased use of simulation and modelling, and the use of computer technologies and future automation capabilities on the construction site. This has created a gradual move of construction education toward the experimental and theoretical side of construction, but unfortunately, away from the applied aspects of construction practice. One result of this move is the increasing fragmentation and specialization in courses and educational experiences. This paper introduces one approach currently being implemented in the Construction Engineering and Management program at Georgia Tech to alter this change. This paper describes the primary components of this approach including the integration of courses, the cooperation required to support the interdisciplinary emphasis, and the establishment of an innovative academic/industry partnership to provide a state-of-the-art physical and technological infrastructure to support the program goals.},

Courses in automated manufacturing including computer numerical control (CNC) machining, materials handling, time and motion study, etc. should be designed to provide students hands on training towards their professional goals. The objective of this project is to manufacture a product using a complete manufacturing system. It includes manufacturing processes such as machining, materials handling, assembly, and inspection. The project also involves time and motion study, flow process charts, and operation sheets as usually required in an industrial production operation. The sample project presented here deals with the manufacturing of a shuttle selector manifold in an industry environment. The manifold was manufactured by a group of students in a local manufacturing company. Methods engineering and work measurements functions were performed wherever possible. The manifold is designed to work on hydraulic systems using petroleum based fluid up to 3000 psi.},

abstract={This paper discusses the development of a three-course concentration in particle technology at NJIT offered across the engineering curriculum which addresses the urgent need for undergraduate and graduate education in this vital field of manufacturing. Funded by an NSF-CRCD grant, a major goal is to integrate recent particle technology research conducted at NJIT and by researchers at other institutions into the three-course sequence. This educational initiative also address one of the main focus areas of NJIT's recently formed Particle Technology Center (PTC), which is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of faculty from the Departments of Mathematics, Mechanical, Chemical, Civil and Electrical Engineering, as well as visiting scholars, post-docs and graduate and undergraduate students. The first course, entitled "Introduction to Particle Technology" which is intended for upper-level undergraduates and first-year graduate students, was given in the Fall 1995 semester and a detailed description of the topics covered is provided. This is followed by a summary of an additional course ("Image Analysis Applications in Particle Technology") also given in Fall 1995, specifically created to familiarize graduate students with some of the special experimental facilities and analytical tools available in the PTC. An upper-level graduate course, entitled "Special Topics in Applied Mathematics: Particle Technology," and offered in the summer 1995 through the Mathematics Department is also described. This course, although not specifically a part of the CRCD project, contributed to the implementation of the program through the development of course materials in modeling fluid-particle flows at low Reynolds numbers.},

abstract={The design experience is very important in all technical areas. Recent trends have pushed design experiences as early in the curriculum as possible. Often, the first design experiences are a single pass "paper" design without any realistic testing and design evaluation. This paper relates the experience of incorporating a design/build/test/redesign project into a Statics course. This is the first course in the Purdue University Mechanical Engineering Technology program where students are being exposed to the design experience. The goal of the project was to expose the students to the full design cycle and to verify that the analysis methods learned in class really do predict the structure's behavior. The project was a group effort to design and build a truss structure given exterior dimension constraints, load point constraints and a provided pack of materials. The student groups were to design the truss to maximize a score determined mainly as a function of the load to failure divided by the structure's weight. On a prearranged date, all trusses were loaded to failure in a tensile test machine. Afterwards, the class as a whole discussed the merits and shortcomings of each of the designs tested, how and why they failed as they did, and how a better tress might be built. This paper relates the particulars of the project definition, how the project was managed, success of the design project in meeting the goals, and students' reactions to the project.},

abstract={In recognition of the growing need for industrial leaders with expertise in both technology and management, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College established in 1988 a management-oriented Master of Engineering (M. E.) degree program. Building on Thayer School's strength in interdisciplinary engineering education and its close relationship with Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, this degree program is distinguished by its simultaneous emphasis on a broad graduate-level education in engineering, a working knowledge of the design process, and a practical understanding of the business environment. The absence of departmental barriers at Thayer School offers students the ability to bring an integrated view to the engineering design process. The M.E. program is a rigorous two-year progression requiring 18 graduate-level courses in statistics, optimization, engineering design, engineering science, and business management. Through the Cook Engineering Design Center, corporations submit to Thayer School a wide variety of design problems, which become the basis of individual and group projects requiring close interaction between students and sponsoring companies. Further, opportunities are made available for all M.E. degree candidates to assume internships in industry prior to graduation. The selection of projects and internships is facilitated by the strong corporate and alumni network maintained by Thayer School.},

abstract={Each year the National Science Foundation (NSF) receives nearly two thousand proposals vying for one of its Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) grants. Roughly 500 of these proposals seek support for engineering laboratories. Each year the NSF gathers together several hundred professionals, most of whom are educators, who review the proposals and recommend which should be funded. The NSF reviewers are grouped into panels, each consisting of about six members. Each panel reviews and ranks 15 to 20 proposals. Since only about one in five proposals receive funding, each panel can expect to have the NSF fund only their top three or four. Interestingly, most proposals are weak and easily denied funding. This paper explains why this is so and gives clear, specific advice on how to ensure that your NSF/ILI grant proposal can have its best chance for funding. Most of the advice offered here will apply equally well to all types of NSF grant proposals.},

abstract={The National Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing Education has been established in Dayton, Ohio with an award from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education program in October of 1994. The primary goal of the program is to develop a curriculum with advanced manufacturing as its focus. The curriculum will begin in the junior year of high school and extend to a two-year associate degree and through a four-year bachelor of science degree in Engineering Technology. The program will include opportunities for industrial employment throughout the student's education. The curriculum is currently being built with a number of "clusters" while ensuring a high degree of collaboration among clusters. The Product Development Cluster is currently being defined and developed. The cluster is designed to address the process of analyzing customer needs, volume demands, and market requirements, conceptualizing and designing a product to meet those needs, designing the manufacturing processes, and launching the product into production. Modules within the cluster include conceptual design, computer aided design, and product development and testing, for example. The cluster is being designed to be broad based, while maintaining a technical manufacturing perspective. The key skills within the cluster have been defined and the topics, sequencing, and method of learning and experiencing are being developed. Innovative pedagogical strategies are being developed and integrated throughout the program. Also the interaction with other modules such as Production Operations, Quality Management, and Materials and Manufacturing Processes is being developed. This program will result in better qualified technical employees for manufacturing industries and also a path for students to get involved with Engineering schools early in their academic careers. Both the results and the process to achieve the results are presented here.},

abstract={The US Department of Energy (DOE) organizes a solar car race called Sunrayce, once in every two years. This race is open for all colleges and universities in the North American continent. As faculty advisor for the undergraduate team here at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), I submitted a proposal in Spring, 1994 and we were selected as one of the 65 teams to compete in Sunrayce 95. The biggest challenge of this project was that the students had to design, fabricate and test the solar car raising money and materials mainly from outside sources. We received support from MTSU and the area industry, and built the solar car, the SOLARAIDER. Curriculum integration was one of the requirements of Sunrayce 95. I identified several problems from the SOLARAIDER project with our Basic, Intermediate and Advanced CADD (Computer-Aided Design/Drafting), Senior Project and Shop Problems courses. The solar car project gave our students a unique opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical situations, gain hands-on experience, and at the same time, get credit for their work. I also worked with the Journalism Department at MTSU, and Motlow State College in Tullahoma, Tennessee, and identified some aspects of the solar car project with their curriculum. The project was a great success and we are looking forward to doing more curriculum integration for Sunrayce 97.},

abstract={The thinking preferences of 487 students at the University if North Carolina at Charlotte were evaluated with the Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) 1 at the beginning of the fall 1995 term. These beginning engineering, computer science, and engineering technology students were grouped in teams of four to seven students for projects in their ENGR 1201 Introduction to Engineering Practice and Principles or EGET 3071 Professional Development in Engineering Technology courses. As much as possible the teams were multi-disciplinary. The engineering teams included computer science, electrical, mechanical, civil, and general (undeclared) majors; the engineering technology teams included electrical, mechanical, civil, and manufacturing engineering technology majors. Half of the teams in each of the two courses were selected with consideration of the HBDI profiles of the students in an attempt to form heterogeneous or so-called "whole-brain" teams; the other half of the teams had random distributions of thinking preferences. At the end of the term, the team projects (and the team learning process) were evaluated by faculty teams in order to test the hypothesis that heterogeneous teams as a whole will have better problem-solving outcomes even when the homogeneous student teams have been taught about thinking preferences and their implications for group dynamics and communications. This is an important issue: can the cost and labor involved in using the HBDI (especially at the freshman level) be justified by its contribution to improved team outcomes? This paper reports the preliminary findings of the first phase of a longitudinal study at UNC Charlotte examining the relationships between the make-up of thinking style profiles of teams and the outcomes they produce. The current study attempts to validate earlier studies of the thinking preferences of engineering students conducted at the University of Toledo 2. The study will add detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment data over a five year projected course. This paper reports initial anecdotal findings; early statistical assessment will be available at the ASEE '96 Annual Conference.},

abstract={This paper describes how to create an effective multimedia structure for a dynamic undergraduate course. The course is CS383, Information Systems, which is an undergraduate level course taught at the United States Military Academy (USMA). CS383 is a fully developed, networked, multimedia course that has completed its third semester of development and delivery. A key aspect of this course is that it deals with a constantly changing body of information. Given the rapid advance of information technology, the course material must change constantly to reflect these new and emerging technologies. The multimedia structure is designed to decrease the maintenance demands of the course. Due to this structure, the instructors' efforts are cumulative in that the effort of every instructor involved in the course makes each lesson better for all instructors presenting the lesson. We discuss audio, video, graphics, and authoring packages. We will also detail the development of the course over the past three semesters and illustrate the key multimedia components of the course. Additionally, we describe the necessary delivery platform use at the USMA and the planned future upgrades for the course.},

abstract={Engineering education curriculum development is critical to all disciplines of engineering education. Most disciplines of engineering (civil, chemical, electrical, industrial, mechanical, etc.) have well established undergraduate, and fairly well developed graduate curriculums. This core set of courses and basic philosophical and technical underpinnings establish the identity of each discipline. Although the core courses and technologies of each discipline undergo scrutiny and revisions on an almost continual basis, there is no doubt that the identity of each discipline is established. This cannot be said about engineering management. The identity crisis with which engineering management has struggled with in the past and continues to combat will not begin to dissipate until the core set of courses, philosophies, technologies, and one might even say values is somewhat established. The reality is that in Engineering Management we lack a defining culture. This paper presents, discusses, and analyses these issues not to present a solution so much as to raise the challenge and initiate the debate. For too long Engineering Management faculty and scholars have avoided this problem. This paper presents some ideas as strawmen for the engineering management community to debate.},

abstract={Bioengineering at the University of Maryland Baltimore County is embarking on a landmark experiment in Engineering Education, which involves M.S. and Ph.D. students in a structured Total Quality Management (TQM) approach to research and development in their thesis and dissertation work. This is a 'value-added' track because the students can work on the same micro problems as in traditional graduate research; however, they are required to apply the tools of TQM in a team effort to the issue of customer satisfaction. This prepares the students to fit directly into the new culture that is now evolving in industry, therefore, enhancing employment opportunities. An educational track consists of specially designed courses to develop a knowledge base across the disciplines. The overlap between bioprocess and biomedical engineering is focused on cellular and molecular biology, stressing recombinant DNA technology. Basic bioscience, medical, law, and business students participate in solving the global problems associated with the production of biologicals. In the research effort, the Protein C deficient patient is the target customer.},

Engineers and engineering managers have a strong sense of responsibility to develop products and make decisions that are highly beneficial to society. They also have an admirable propensity to adhere to prescribe ethical codes of the profession. However, the need for a higher level of societal concern and public responsibility is now emerging with sophisticated high technology products and services. Special courses in graduate curricula are advocated to help engineering managers and engineers develop a better understanding of the role of technology in shaping public policy and a moral-reasoning process to sharpen their capabilities and sensitivity for serving the public interest at the highest possible level.},

abstract={Industrial and manufacturing engineering education must stay abreast with the technical advances and changes in quality and manufacturing philosophies in today's fast changing global arena. By incorporating the new advances in technology in a flexible engineering curriculum, and by still maintaining the principle of coherence, one can include the breadth of the subject and the unique coverage on new technology clusters in engineering disciplines. More and more companies are turning to academic institutions for answers in the areas of advanced technology and training. As the manufacturing sector becomes more competitive, the managers expect more from recent engineering graduates. They are expected to be exposed to the leading advances in technology, and be familiar with the latest trends in design, fabrication, and implementation of various manufacturing processes. In some cases, they are expected to know about the latest accomplishments in research and development. This paper uses ISO 9000, a new and popular approach towards quality control and quality management, as an example of the academic curriculum lagging behind industrial needs. Whether it is a new software, a radical philosophy or a newly conceived model, the engineering curriculum must be modified to incorporate and accommodate very quickly for the rapid changes in today's technology.},

abstract={The need for managerial effectiveness of manufacturing engineering executives in competitive organizations is paramount. As the impact of technology has changed the competitive manufacturing environment, the manufacturing engineering executives' needs have to be re-examined and addressed by appropriate executive development or continuing professional education. One of the objectives of the management development function is the inculcation of behavioral change in the manufacturing executives. This change may be in the form of knowledge, skills and attitudes. This may eventually result in change in performance for the better. Management education in the industries has been imparting knowledge and skills to the executives, but to a lesser extent inculcating change in attitudes. The main issue is the ineffectiveness of current management development and training programs given to manufacturing engineers which do not enable executives transfer their newly acquired theoretical knowledge to performance. The purpose of this research is to uncover a more effective executive education program for manufacturing engineers. This may offer a different perspective of executive education for management development in order to narrow the gap between ideal management development objectives and actual performance of the engineers.},

abstract={In today's competitive world, the manufactures have to get new and improved products to the market as fast as possible to be able to compete in the global market. The major obstacle for this task had been a long product development cycle, i.e. design, prototype manufacture and testing. The introduction of rapid prototyping (RP) into the early stages of product development has greatly reduced the development time frame and cost involved in prototype manufacturing. Furthermore, RP applications are growing very fast in such a way that it is now possible to produce parts not as prototypes, but as final parts to be used in several engineering applications. Thus, RP is now acting as a bridge to help designers, manufacturing engineers, marketing and sales personnel to timely provide goods to the customer. This paper discusses RP practices and its future trends. This paper also discusses the current developments in this technology to realize its full benefits.},

The expected outcomes of these programs are improved motivation and better student retention. A survey was performed to benchmark the prevalence of Tech Prep articulation agreement between institutions offering ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) accredited engineering technology programs and various high school systems throughout the United States.},

The Technology Accreditation Commission (TAC) has begun to implement an outcome-based assessment approach as evidenced by certain TAC criteria which require institutions to gage progress toward self-specified goals through such tools as graduate assessment and employer feedback. The American Society of Engineering Education has also called for engineering programs to establish individual objectives and specific outcomes for their programs which should be periodically reviewed. More attention is now given to the continuous improvement of curricula, faculty, facilities and procedures.},

abstract={For today's competitive manufacturing industry, the need for effectiveness of their engineering executives is now most pertinent and paramount. As the impact of manufacturing technology has changed the competitive manufacturing environment, the engineering executives' needs have to be re-examined and addressed by proper needs assessment for appropriate executive development programs and continuing professional education of their future managers. One of the objectives of management development function is the inculcation of behavioral change in executives. This change may be in the form of knowledge, skills and attitudes which may eventually precipitate change in performance for the better. But generally management education in the industries has been one of imparting knowledge and skills to the executives, and to a lesser extent inculcating change in attitudes. The main challenge to continuing professional education of engineers and trainers has been to have these executives transform their newly acquired competencies to performance. The purpose of this research is to uncover the current needs of effectiveness of engineers in a detailed and reliable fashion by defining and determining the correlates of executive effectiveness and their interrelationships for productivity.},

The mission of the center is to open access to highly qualified engineering and agricultural scientist students and faculties from both Mexico and the U.S., to participate jointly in projects to accelerate the industrialization process in Sinaloa. Two interdisciplinary researchers one from an engineering department and one from a food sciences and nutrition department carried out infra-structural assessments in Sinaloa focusing on: human resources, technological industrial support and local and state government programmatic plans for economic development. Their findings indicate that rapid access to particular `know-how-methods and quick technology deployment is needed to expand industrialization efforts in developing economies. The proposed center is being conceptualized as a linking model for faculty and students in Mexican and U.S. colleges to provide a global engineering educational foundation while working in international industrial projects.},

Company A in northern Indiana had a great shortage of technically competent employees who were able to maintain their complex equipment. Company B in central Indiana was experiencing forty-four percent machine downtime in their newly automated manufacturing plant. Neither their journeymen electricians, electronic technicians nor maintenance engineers were sufficiently skilled to troubleshoot and repair the Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) equipment or robots in a timely manner. In each case, management, union leadership and a local technical college jointly developed an educational program to meet the company's needs. The technical curriculum paralleled the associate engineering technology degrees offered by the institutions but the teaching-learning process was altered to incorporate experiential teamwork relative to 'real-life-manufacturing' problem-solving, decision making and communications. This paper presents these programs, describes the results, and relates how this methodology can be utilized in Engineering Technology introductory courses.},

abstract={Education serves two primary customers: those being educated and those hiring the graduates. Both customers prefer an educational setting that imparts knowledge to students in a manner which enables them to apply that information to real life situations. Courses need to create a tie between the information received in the classroom and the applications of that information in an industrial setting. Graduates will be hired by a variety of service, process and manufacturing industries. Job descriptions will be as many and as varied as the graduates who are filling them. Although differences exist between an industrial setting and an educational one, there are certain skills that can be honed in an educational setting that are invaluable in the workplace. Incorporating total quality management concepts into the creation of the courses can help identify many of the needs of customers and strengthen the course material being taught.

abstract={In 1992, the Director of The Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) approached West Virginia University (WVU) and proposed a Cooperative Agreement between DOE/METC and WVU. Its goal would be for WVU faculty and other resources to serve as the research arm for DOE/METC in the area of hazardous waste site remediation undertaking the problems which are or may be barriers to providing a technology which would allow commercialization of the process. The bulk of the applied research would most likely be accomplished in the Colleges of Engineering and the College of Arts & Sciences.},

abstract={The Engineering Technologies Department of the College of Staten Island has designed a degree, the Management Engineering Technology Degree, which will afford current undergraduates and previous graduates of two year TAC/ABET accredited engineering technology programs the opportunity to continue their education. This degree is an add-on degree; students would be required to have A.A.S. degree in one engineering technology programs. This degree is a Bachelor of Science degree with a significant liberal arts component. For the major itself, the students would be required to take advanced technical courses and courses in management.},

abstract={The Southern California Coalition for Education in Manufacturing Engineering (SCCEME) is an eight million dollar sponsored project by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Within the SCCEME grant awarded to Dean Richard Williams, College of Engineering, California State University, Long Beach, `Televised Advanced Manufacturing Courses' are offered. Students use first-class hard/software systems at computer labs and share upgraded up-to-date laboratory equipment out of one location. The following technological innovations are applied: Feature-Based-Solid Modeling. Controlling the motion of a robot arm 50 miles away visible on the monitor of a networked 486 PC using software on UNIX-based workstations via emulation. Manufacturing the real model automatically over night using the Rapid Prototyping equipment LOM. Measuring the tolerance via a 3-D Scanner. Using electronic boards in classrooms. For demonstration, on-line operations within California State University laboratories in Long Beach can be projected by video on a large screen within the conference room.},
