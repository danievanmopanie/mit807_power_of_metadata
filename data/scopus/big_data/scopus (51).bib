abstract={Adopting complexity concept in product design provides ability to manage existing resources and to meet the rapid development of market demand from existing and future markets. Currently, the best approach in managing product complexity is through optimization and trade-off. Both methods are considered as a constraint to product development and innovation that evolves alongside with new market trend. Complexity Planning is proposed, with the integration of strategic tools of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving). Through a case study, the guideline helps the designer to develop a design concept that considers commonality and trend of system evolution as a preventive initiative to enhance better complexity management within the product life cycle. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The rising of environmental concerns from customers, buyers, communities, and government regulations have forced company to implement innovative and proactive corporate environmental management such as green supply chain management (GSCM) and green innovation. The aim of the paper is to discuss on the development of green innovation measurement. The data were collected through a questionnaire-based survey from two experts. The data are analyzed using Inter Rater Agreement. The findings show the kappa value is above 80 percent which indicates the perfect agreement between both of the raters on the proposed measurements for green marketing innovation and reverse logistics innovation. By including these two constructs into existing green innovation activity, it is possible to show the complete picture of green innovation to increase the performance of GSCM. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Recently in most Chinese CNC machining enterprises, the selection of cutting tools still depends on the experience of individual workers, which is hard to be inherited by others. Faced with this situation, we developed a web application for selecting proper cutting tools in CNC machining workshop, named ct-SELECTOR for short. This article introduces the main functions of the ct-SELECTOR and analyzed the three key enable technologies for realizing each function: (1) the automatic cutting-tool selection and match, (2) the optimal recommendation and management of metal cutting parameters and (3) the management and off-line prediction of tool-life. Finally, the developing architecture of the ct-SELECTOR is demonstrated, and a running example is illustrated to verify the validity and practicability of this system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Power grid crisis happening at home and abroad warns the urgency of power grid crisis management. It is necessary to research on online intelligent decision-making system of power-grid security based on data mining. This paper studies the status of foreign online intelligent decision-making system of power-grid security and the concrete application of foreign online intelligent decision-making system of power-grid security. Based on advanced data mining technology, by online updating safety limit-rules and automatically digging out the running rules, the safe limit values are in line with actual condition of power-grid, dispatchers can adjust the grid by running this limit and can obtain a larger cross-section delivery power-flow. In such a way, it not only can ease the power shortage situation of the system, but also improve poor power transmission ability, and produce economic benefits. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to review the existing waste management practices, regulatory and institutional framework and technologies that are being employed currently for waste management in Sri Lanka in order to understand the magnitude of non-hazardous and hazardous waste problems and how to avoid these problems. This study is mainly based on information collected from literature review covering both municipal solid waste management and hazardous waste management. Sri Lanka has well-developed legislative and well-organized institutional framework with environmental related policies, strategies and guidelines on waste management. Technologies and methods used for waste management are well accepted, but innovative technologies and strategies have to be introduced to streamline and uplift the existing waste management practices. This study also revealed that there is a high potential in private sector involvement in waste management. Considering all these aspects, a detailed comprehensive technical review and potential technology development are necessary to deal with all categories of wastes generated in Sri Lanka. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The rapid industrialization, continuous economic development, as well as increasing urban population and people's living standards in Urumqi have resulted in a great increase of the total generated amount of municipal solid waste (MSW). Urumqi government strives to improve its municipal solid waste management (MSWM), and the MSW safe disposal rate was already up to 92.9% in 2011. This study presents an detailed overview on current MSWM practice in Urumqi municipality, including MSW characteristics and current status of MSW generation, collection, transportation and final disposal. It shows that more than 80% of MSW was final disposed by landfill and current landfill based MSWM system lack of effectiveness and efficiency. The major barriers and challenges that inhibit effective and efficient MSWM are imperfectness and inefficient enforcement of relevant policies, inappropriate waste treatment fee system, backward technology, insufficient public education and participation, as well as lack of fundamental research. Finally, to overcome such barriers, we propose a detailed integrated MSWM system to facilitate MSWM in Urumqi. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Currently, the research and application associated with the Cloud Computing are mainly concentrated in Educational Information Management System (EMIS). In this paper, we proposed the model of the educational information system resources integration based on private cloud green. This finding is from the principles and characteristics of the cloud computing and the improved traditional virtualization technology. In this context of meeting the maximum reusability about the original system and reducing the costs of secondary development, we can make seamless integration and on-demand call among the heterogeneous, remote and different platforms and the tight coupling multi-EMISs in one "system". So that, we make the sharing of information among which is difficult to interact with each other in the &information island& and even integrate a variety of underlying independent hardware into a unified whole. Finally, this model can change according to demands and intelligently adjust the integrated hardware resources, achieving the better balance between effectiveness and resources, energy saving and basically meeting the needs of the data sharing. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

This paper constituted a analytical frame using game theory to rethink about basic features and status quo of duplicate checking, roundly researched the pursuit of relevant participants. It pointed out asymmetric information is an important factor in the duplicate checking.In addition,investigation cost and inappropriate management mechanism also lead to the relevant departments wouldn't check the fraud. Namely, the government shouldn't carry out strict supervision, but moderate supervision. And then the participant try to make the competent authorities unaware of the fraud. As a result, the aim of supervision isn't to stop all plagiarism, but to limit academic dishonesty to some extent. Finally, some valuable suggestions against plagiarism and applied technology were prompted. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of city, city population, regional planning and city ecological environment are facing with more and more tremendous pressure, so the development and utilization of city underground space has become common concern. In recent years, underground structures have been widely applied in the fields of city construction, transportation, defense engineering, water conservancy project etc. Many countries in the world have been the development and utilization of underground space as an important way to intensively implement the land resource and sustainable development of the city. In our country, there is still very great potential of underground space development and utilization of underground structure. Human development and utilization of underground space has long history. In our country, storage of food in the underground has a history of over 5000 years. During World War II, the combatant country's ground factories and buildings were destroyed greatly but the underground factories, warehouses, military facilities constructed in the tunnel, karsts caves and mines were all safely and soundly. Since the 70's, with the development of modern science and technology and industry, the utilization of underground space gradually shifted to protect the environment, save energy, to solve the city traffic. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={It is annually produced 400 thousand tons of solid waste in the city of Rostov-on-Don, which is taken for disposal to landfill at the Northwest industrial area of the city. Nearly 60 tons of waste enters Rostov Material Recovery Facility every year for the sorting, extracting commercially attractive factions, pressing, briquetting and subsequent transportation of "residue tail" to the landfill. However, the percentage of recycling in Rostov (10%) remains low, as a result of the shortcomings of the system. Recently, the Administration of Rostov-on-Don has produced a development strategy of integrated municipal solid waste management to create a new system of waste management in Rostov-on-Don. The strategy focuses mainly at Resource efficiency, which is a blend of good infrastructure, collection and design, with a dash of innovation and a strong policy framework to back it up. For the successful implementation of the strategy it is necessary to introduce an integrated system of municipal solid waste management using GIS. The methodology of integrated system with using GIS was developed by specialists of City Planning and Community Development Department of the Rostov State University of Civil Engineering. It includes implementation of collection and storage of waste and environmental data along with vehicle's navigation system through ArcGIS ESRI software. It helps to facilitate collection operations, to analyze optimal locations for transfer stations, to plan routes for vehicles transporting waste from residential, commercial and industrial customers to transfer stations and from transfer stations to landfills, to calculate amount of waste collection sites in accordance with the population density and volume of bins, to locate new landfills and to monitor the landfill. GIS is a tool that also provides a digital data bank for optimization of waste collection sites allocation according with implementation of General City Plan. The territory of Rostov-on-Don has been chosen for case study.

abstract={With the clear emission reduction target of China for 2020, the refining industry as a large emission source inevitably plays a significant role. The paper confirmed and assessed three commercially available CO2 separation technologies for refineries, vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), monoethanolamine (MEA) and membrane absorption (MA). The economic results indicate that the capital cost of constructing a CO2 capture unit is 35.996 M¥, 34.418 M¥, 37.502 M¥, respectively. And the corresponding cost of avoided is 379.8 ¥/tCO2, 249.6 ¥/tCO2 and 376.5 ¥/t CO2. Sensitivity analyses are also performed examining the effect of CO2 price on economic feasibility, as well as improvements of regeneration energy demand and CO2 capture system on the CO2 avoided cost. The regeneration energy demand impacts the avoided cost significantly, whereas CO2 capture system demonstrates insensitivity. Though the CO2 avoided cost for MEA case is highest, MEA has been commercially the most available processe so far for existing refineries. However, MA will be the most promising alternative to chemical absorption in the future, provided that membrane performance is further improved. In addition, the CO2 avoided cost of VSA is close to that of MEA, but other economic indicators are optimal due to a large amount of H2 recovered. Currently, without any incentive and a major technological break-through, CO2 capture from the source of hydrogen production units at Chinese refineries is the most attractive opportunity. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={When the optimization of the manufacturing units is considered, the management usually focus on equipment costs and technology parameters. However, being the rising price of the energy, the energy efficiency has become a sensitive issue. Detailed energy related information should be collected in order to understand the consumption profile of each relevant machine/process and identify potential energy savings. Data gathering is time-consuming and very expensive since individual metering devices have to be used for each consumer. To overcome this inconvenient, several solution have been reported. All of them are making use of a single metering device (monitoring the overall energy consumption) and some Load Signature Identification algorithms, used to disaggregate the overall energy between the identified consumers. Their relatively low detection rate (about 80-90%) hindered the spread of LSI-based architectures. In this context, a new hybrid architecture is proposed in this paper, together with it's hybrid LSI algorithm. Several test performed in an electronic prototyping facility result in a detection rate close to 100%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Useful information often hides in traffic management system. To mine useful data, prior knowledge has been used to train the artificial neural network (ANN) to identify the traffic conditions in the traffic information forecasting. Subjective information has hence been introduced into the ANN model. To solve this problem, a new ANN model is proposed based on the data mining technology in this work. The Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM) is firstly employed to cluster the traffic data through an unsupervised learning and provide the labels for these data. Then labeled data were used to train the GA-Chaos optimized RBF neural network. Herein, the GA-Chaos algorithm is used to train the RBF parameters. Experimental tests use practical data sets from the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to validate the performance of the proposed ANN model. The results show that the proposed method can extract the potential patterns hidden in the traffic data and can accurately predict the future traffic state. The prediction accuracy is beyond 95%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Without any doubt, one of the most worldwide challenging and controversial issues in the current century is the energy problem. In most countries, the increase of energy consumption, especially in building, has made energy saving and efficiency strategies important target for energy policies. In general, there are many ways to save energy. The most common method of economizing is within culturalization. For such purpose, building energy management system (BEMS) is considered as the latest idea of energy. Having a dynamic environment, smart buildings are affordable by the integration of four main elements: systems, structure, service, management, and the relationship between them. Intelligent buildings provide these benefits through intelligent control systems. In this paper, while introducing the energy management in buildings, it studies their applications and also their effects on management and optimization of energy consumption. The office building in San Francisco, USA with 66,943 ft2 area is considered as a case study for this research. Energy consumption is reduced 50 percent by implementing BMS in this building. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Modern enterprises consist of complex business systems. These systems need to be integrated to support enterprises operation. The SOA and ESB become an important enterprise integration architecture style for designing and implementing integration systems. But there are some limitations of today's ESB framework, such as only syntactic description of service interface, inability to perform semantic mediation and incapable process knowledge management. Therefore developers need deep and intimate knowledge to develop integration systems. We introduce an ontology-based semantic annotation approach to enrich and reconcile semantics of data, services and process models on ESB that enables data, service and process models interoperability on the semantic level through common domain ontologies. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To obtain SAF we have focused research on Al-Mg alloys with different concentrations of magnesium and silicon carbide (SiC). To obtain these materials has been chosen different gas blowing method (N2, SO2 and C4H10). It was observed that the best results in terms of pore volume gave blowing with C4H10. The samples obtained were analyzed by optical and electron microscopy. The paper also presents some manufacturing processes of SAF, (such as sheet casting, low pressure casting, precursor technology) and some SAF's characteristic properties. Finally, the various application fields for cellular metals are discussed. They are divided into structural and functional applications and are treated according to their relevance for the different industrial sectors. Stabilized Aluminium Foams (SAF) are new class of materials with low densities and novel physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical and acoustic properties. They offer potential for lightweight structures, for energy absorption, and for thermal management; and some of them, at least, are cheap. Metal foams offer significant performance gains in light, stiff structures, for the efficient absorption of energy, for thermal management and perhaps for acoustic control and other, more specialized, applications. They are recyclable and nontoxic. They hold particular promise for market penetration in applications in which several of these features are exploited simultaneously. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={For over 20 years the term "three-dimensional scan" (3D) showed the world the possibilities of virtual design, simulation, or reverse engineering. 3D scanning is also known as 3D digitizing, the name coming from the fact that this is a process that uses a contact or non-contact digitizing probe to capture the objects form and recreate them in a virtual workspace through a very dense network of points (xyz) as a 3D graph representation. Until recently, digitization was limited by the speed of the scan head and the correct choice of the probing system, type of scanned piece and budget for the purchase or develops the scanning system. With the evolution of technology appeared a number of new techniques that tend to improve the properties of classical methods. Even if intended for copying or geometrical control, or rather virtual geometric modelling or product realization, there are two groups of technologies: with contact (classical methods with probes) or without contact (laser, optical or combination). Most automotive manufacturers currently use 3D scan metrology based on optical or laser systems to validate products quality. The pieces are initially measured by 3D scanning then they are compared with the designed model (CAD file) using a specialized software. By this comparison producer can interfere very quickly in the manufacturing process to remove the cause of defects, this technique being called Reverse Engineering (RE). There are many variables that affect accuracy of laser scanning and therefore the quality of information: reflectance of surface, colour object, recesses, openings narrow and sharp edges can be difficult to scan. This accuracy may vary from micron to millimetre and the acquisition's size from a few points to several thousand points per second. The overall accuracy of a 3D acquisition system depends above all on the sensor's precision and on the acquisition device (acquisition with contact) or acquisition structure (acquisition without contact). In a perfect world or in an integrated production environment, 3D measuring systems should be able to measure all the necessary parameters in a single step without errors, and to render the results in the same way to the manufacturing networks equipped with computers, in formats useful for machines control and processes management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This research paper aims to develop and empirically test a theoretical model, positing relationships among entrepreneur, technology and resources. The methodology used involved a quantitative approach, by means of a questionnaire based survey on a sample of undergraduate management and engineering students across five Romanian faculties. The results were based on structural equation modeling analysis. Results provide strong support for the proposition that the success of a good business idea strongly depends on some factors, including the capabilities of an entrepreneur, the technology used to implement the idea and the necessary resources. The paper demonstrates that the success of an idea in technological entrepreneurship, based on the potential young entrepreneurs' point of view is influenced by the characteristics of the young entrepreneur, by his capabilities and his knowledge. The success is also influenced in some proportions by the innovation of technology, its development and globalization. The third category of the success factors is resources, which includes temporal resources, material resources, financial resources and informational resources. The conclusion of this research is that the most important factor for a successful business idea is the entrepreneur. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rise and rapid development of the systems biology, in order to explore the relationship between different levels of Bioinformatics relevance, the need of integrated visualization of biological scientific computing data at different levels is increasingly urgent. This paper propses a molecular structure and genome sequence synthesized visualization metadata model, and then implements the integration management of the visualization data of molecular structure and genome sequence. This method can effectively support the development of visualization capabilities of molecular structure and gene sequence. Based on the XML technology, by deep researching in the field of visualization data format and applying this synthesized visualization metadata model, this paper designs and introduces the conversion method for visualization data of molecular structure and genome sequence. Ultimately, based on this synthesized visualization metadata model, a synthesized visualization prototype system for molecular structure and gene sequence (VMG) has been developed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={More Electric Aircraft(MEA), which is the developing trend of the next generation of aircraft, put forward high demands on the electric power system. Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) are a kind of novel intelligent systems with computation resources and controlled physical objects tightly integrated and interacted in the future network environment. CPS have the characteristics of real-time, synchronous, security, efficient and autonomous. This paper first elaborates the notion, characteristics, operation mechanism and technical challenges of CPS. The strategy of CPS-based next aviation electric power systems is presented. Then, the architecture of aviation electric power cyber physical systems is established. Finally, key technologies of aviation electric power cyber physical systems, including data bus, control strategies, energy management, security analysis, modeling and simulation, standardized and so on, are discussed. And directions are pointed out to offer a reference for the application of CPS in aviation electric power systems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, the number and size of Web services on the Internet have a rapid development. Industry and academia start to study the web service. In Internet resources, if the web cannot be found, the web service will become meaningless. So for web services, large-scale managements and problems are the keys of the study of Internet service resources. This paper studies large-scale distributed web services in network resources based on SOA architecture ideas. It also designs the unified management and organization system of ideological and political education which treat the ideological and political education as the content. It proposes SN network resource service model of ideological and political education. With the development and popularization of the Internet today, the study on Internet resources of ideological and political education in this paper provides a theoretical reference for the innovation of the ideological and political education. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Internet routers play an important role during network congestion. All the routers have buffers at input and output ports to hold the packets at congestion. Various congestion control algorithms have been proposed to control the congestion. Recently, some proportional-integralderivative (PID) controller based algorithms have been proposed as Active Queue Management(AQM) schemes to address performance degradations of end-to-end TCP congestion control. However, most of the proposed PID-controllers for AQM are validated for their performance and stability via intuitive explanation and simulation studies instead of theoretic analysis and performance evaluation. But there are a few drawbacks of PID-controller based AQM algorithms leading to poor performance like causing data retention dropping and oscillation when the time delay is large, which means that the existing PID-controller can not meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional PID, we analyze and enhance the PID-controller based AQM algorithm by regarding the TCP congestion control mechanism as an input-rate based Adaptive Fuzzy Neuron PID control algorithm(IRAFNPID) to avoid congestion in TCP/AQM networks. By means of simulations, we evaluate and compare the performance of traditional PID, single neural adaptive PID(SNAPID) and IRAFNPID, simulations with experiment data analysis and find that IRAFNPID has better convergence, stability, robustness, goodput and lower loss ratio. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of economy, the existence and application of the inflammable, explosive, toxic and harmful gases irresistible but dangerous at the same time in the industrial production application. for the sake of minimizing potential dangers, the remote security monitoring is of great significance. With the rapid development of network technology, the Internet network technology to implement the remote monitoring can effectively avoid some potential hazards in the industrial production and other dangerous things. We can draw a conclusion from the feedback that the effect of user experience is not ideal in the actual application. So based on the analysis of the traditional structure of remote monitoring system, a new remote monitoring system is created which can avoid these shortcomings through further research. This new system consists of three parts: 1. The client: using Flex rich client technology is more convenient and suitable for communication interface and let the customer feel familiar and easy to use. 2. data management layer: it contains three parts: the Web server layer, application server and database server layer. Application server promotes system real-time performance through Web Service technology, Shared memory and streaming Socket technology, which enables clients to have direct access to the site. 3. Data acquisition layer: data will be collected in a timely manner to send to data management with GPRS technology. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In most of China's rural areas, the devices of power distribution area are low configured, simply designed and installed, and have few functions but lots of forms. Beyond, most of them only implement simple functions of power distribution and metering. They couldn't meet the needs of transformation of rural power grid. So it's extremely urgent to reconstruct and build intelligent rural power distribution and realize the standardization of information model and the intelligent integrated management of power distribution area to improve the quality and reliability of power supply. In this paper, we analyzed the current development situation of China's rural area. Then from the aspect of solving the lagging intelligent level of rural power system, we do some research about developing a new intelligent integrated distribution box and distribution transformer terminal, then we propose the intelligent manage system of power distribution area to realize high intelligent level of power distribution management, high level monitoring and control and greatly improved manage efficiency. At the same time, we enhanced the serving strength for the customer and help to improved the entire intelligent power load, so we could supply high quality power to our customers. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The frequency and time of precipitation can influence the storage, allocation and management of water resources. But the precipitation frequency becomes more random and the precipitation process becomes more complexity due to the climate change and human activities, which increases the difficulty of technology and management. In this research, the fractal dimension based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) as the index of the precipitation complexity is applied to describe the precipitation process; using it, the complexity distributions of different precipitation processes in Liu-Kuang zone of Qingzhang basin China in different periods is illuminated respectively. The result indicates that in research region: (1) the annual precipitation frequency in the late period is less than that in the early period; (2) the urbanization and human activities increase the precipitation frequency. This result can reflect the frequency change of precipitation in changing environment and provide reference for the decision-making of water resources management in the local basin. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of vehicles-to-grid (V2G) technology, electric vehicles (EVs) are receiving increasing attention in recent years. This paper describes a smart home energy dispatch model including EVs and flexible appliances. In this model, the home's electricity cost is minimized through optimal dispatch, while the comfort level of home is considered. A simplified method to measure battery degradation is proposed. The model is solved by the dissipative particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm. Simulation results show that the battery lifetime can be extended when the battery degradation is considered in the charging and discharging of the EV. With the decrease in the battery cost, the user has more incentives to use the EV as a storage device to reduce the electricity cost. © (2014) Trans Tech Publicutions, Switzerland.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to show how to apply TRIZ to resolve difficulties and conflicts in Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) for detecting surface defects on small metal parts and saving effort-spent (energy saving). TRIZ has been well-known as a creative and innovative thinking theory in solving engineering and technology contradictions in the last two decades. However, few studies and practical usage were proposed in AOI area. Conflicts occurring in AOI are discussed to demonstrate the ideas guided by 39 TRIZ management parameters, 40 innovative principles, and contradiction matrix. The results show that TRIZ is able to provide direct, quick and effective alternatives to resolve the conflicts in AOI. In this manner, huge effort and cost can be saved in further execution stage. In this paper, the detection for surface defects on small and precise metal part are utilized as a case study to describe the proposed TRIZ-based conflicts-solution in AOI implementation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Institutions of Higher Learning in Malaysia had been viewed as the source for new innovation. Hence, few universities in Malaysia had been upgraded to the status of Research University to reinforce the nation's New Economic Model via research, development and commercialization of new innovation. As such, Technology Driven innovation model that traditionally used by academic in Institutions of Higher Learning is now insufficient to support the innovation work within the scope and definition of Research University, this is due to it is lack of focus on commercialization element. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an innovation model devotes to Research Universities in Malaysia. In line with this, the paper reviews the important elements of innovation, followed by comparison of elements in corporate and academic innovation models. Finding from this paper suggested that building-up innovation competency in Research University requires an innovation model that integrates all innovation elements from holistic business points of view. The paper proposed an integrated innovation model based on Total Innovation Management paradigm. The proposed model has descriptive value in terms of studying, classifying and defining the important elements and relationships that govern innovation process and management aspects in Research universities within Malaysia. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Increased focus on reducing CO2 emissions has created growing interest in CO2 capture from industrial processes for storage in underground formations.
New technical solutions, costs and energy requirements for ship-based transport of CO2 are presented. All elements in the transport chain, namely liquefaction, storage, loading system, dedicated CO2 ship(s), onshore loading and unloading, and offshore unloading systems are included in the paper. Over 80 % from the primary energy consumed all over the world is obtained from fossil oil and natural gas. The last researches have shown the energy dependences of these types of fuels. The transition to the economy based on the low influence of the carbon, the carbon capture technology, is the main means to reconsider the fossil fuels for meeting the needs for reduction of negative emissions. This is necessary for keeping the world temperature at normal levels. The main target of this paper is to put highlight the negative effect of CO2 emissions and the interest in recovery of carbon dioxide from flue gases trough multiple factors: the merchant CO2 market, renewed interest in enhanced oil recovery, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also takes in account modalities of transport and storage of CO2. Solutions for CO2 capture and injection into caverns instead of natural deposits were found worldwide. These solutions are not applicable however all over the world and they are not a priority in the environment protection activity.Another important aspect calls for all merchant ships requirements regarding CO2 emissions through index calculation and development of Management Plan. Also, to increase the control of CO2 it would be useful to identify the caverns where it is possible to deposit the CO2, to build new special ship for CO2 transport or replace natural deposits through CO2 injection. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Using organizational performance management that is validated and used in active companies, this research aims to study business performance management in entrepreneurial frameworks. This study presents a conceptual approach based on some theories founded on the organizational performance management as a process, but adapted to the context of entrepreneurship. It is proposed the conceptual analysis and submitting the verification of the formulated hypotheses. An entrepreneurial framework is defined by some factors such as: entrepreneur, along with his personal and professional characteristics, who is the main actor of the so-called entrepreneurial process; business idea that entrepreneur wants to turn it into profitable business; market opportunity, which demonstrates that the business idea is valid, has novelty and can be fructified and developed; business plan, that needs to be well prepared in a very detailed manner and containing long run strategies; business start-up resources, including time resources allocated to implement the business plan, physical resources, information, financial and human resources; the environment where the business will be active; technology needed to develop the business activity. To study more closely the issue of performance management in entrepreneurial contexts, will be defined entrepreneurial performance management as a process, which can lead to the success rate of a business idea and to the rate of business sustainability. To perform this study it has been proposed a case study where an entrepreneur wants to develop a business in renewable energy, and more specifically, the development of a solar power plant that transforms solar energy into electricity, which then it’s been introduced into the national grid of electricity supply. So in this research will be studied the entire process by which the real business appears and a variant of the case that the solar power plant could be built in Romania and will be proposed a detailed system of performance indicators, specific to the entrepreneurial framework. Using a research methodology based on case study, this research has as a central objective, to define the entrepreneurial performance management through a set of specific performance indicators, which can then be used in practice, by entrepreneurs who want to start a new business in renewable energy. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The business ecosystems’ domain emerged as result to the necessity of assessment of new economic procedures and mechanisms between the economic agents. Defined as a community of interrelated agents, a business ecosystem’s approach can emphasize the most important features of modern economy. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of business ecosystems with biological ones in order to identify the most important internal features which can describe the symbiosis process. In biological field, the symbiosis is defined as an association of individuals from different type of species. In the business field, this form of association is defined in terms of co-evolution and cooperation. From this point of view it is important to analyze main species who are involved into this type of relations. The starting point of this research is to define reference dimension whose knowledge is important in order to understand involved entities. At this step the concept of innovation will be considered as knowledge reference. The research method will be conducted based on the identification of different categories of elements, individuals and their integration into specific species. This integration will be realized by grouping individuals according to analyzed common features. The foreseen result is to highlight how the individuals’ knowledge about innovation contributes to the common vision of the entire group. The next step of the research framework will provide a comparative analysis between the established groups of individuals. The main outcome of this research is to provide a new model of reintegration of individuals from different domains of activity not limited by organizational boundaries. As result, this paper will provide a framework for understanding the symbiosis from two points of views: the fusion process among the agents and the knowledge transfer as its result. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Modern manufacturing plants even if they produce in large quantities, they often have to change the settings of their production lines. Customers do not want a standard product but personalized models. If the differences are only an option that can be mounted to the finished elements is not difficult. When the differences are much more serious and require changes in the technology of the element. Such orders are collected and made periodically so customers have to wait. Sometimes the wait time is several months. Changing the configuration of the production line or just a robot cell is a difficult and time-consuming process. It is necessary to stop the entire production line, the partially disassemble and installation of new equipment, and after the production of the series, the process repeated. The reconfiguration can take from several hours to several days, even weeks. These changes are costly, and these costs are borne by people buying individual model. Here are examples of the concepts presented elements of an exemplary robotic cell. Different degrees of modification will be presented from simple mechanical systems shortening the time to reconfigure the cell to a fully automatic reconfigurable systems. As an example will be presented to the cell welding. This cell is ready to make a specific item. The concept of adapting the cell to make the like is the first step modification. The next step is to automate the position so that the elements can be produced alternately. The introduction of an additional item of the approximated dimensions to the list made in a cell and automation, is another way to increase the flexibility of the cell. The final stage of the present article is the concept of robotic cell, designed to make the same process for any element. These concepts require a change in transmitting information to each of the stages and the whole process control at every stage. It is possible to transfer productive resources but this requires advanced management methods. Ensuring the mobility of selected measures to increase production efficiency but this requires the use of such multi-agent systems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Currently it is a critical situation when every year due to aggressive external factors thousands of listed buildings are under threat of destruction around the world. In many ways, the state of affairs is due to the lack of effective integrated management of listed buildings. Lack of integrated tool for operating of different data, which determines the structural integrity of listed buildings and condition of environment, has led to the fact that most of the regional and municipal authorities are not able to handle the diversity of information. To address these problems specialist of Department of City Planning and Community Development of Rostov State University of Civil Engineering developed the methodology and information-analytical support system of listed buildings’ preservation. This support is able to analyze different types of data and to use different IT technologies such as CAD systems, GIS-technologies and databases. Information technologies in management of listed buildings can help municipalities with a limited budget to get the most out of existing services as these are the technologies that help different departments to work more closely with each other. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The education cause continues to develop in our country, and the achievements of vocational college teaching are increasingly significant. The proportion of history teaching is growing in fostering the humanity accomplishments, and it supervises and perfects the humanistic quality, especially for the overall development of students. This thesis discusses the measures to improve the humanity accomplishments in vocational college history teaching from three aspects: analyzes the current situation of humanity cultivation in vocational colleges; describes its importance; proposes development measures. It Provides constructive suggestions for the development of a new era’s of humanity accomplishments in vocational college history teaching.
With the continuous development and perfectation of education cause, the education of higher vocational colleges are gaining more and more attention. Due to the rapid development of IT and technology, students in vocational colleges are educated mostly on technology and information. Today, the educational objectives in many colleges are too occupational and one-sided, most educators believe that students should go the way of special personnel training, and the focus should be placed on the management positions or practice positions, thereby ignoring the humanities cultivation in history teaching, not only the students failing to get the all-round development, but also the desired objectives failing to be achieved. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The virtual simulation experiment framework consists of hardware and software function modules, which are both designed in this thesis. The application of virtual experiment framework has changed the traditional teaching method to a large extent, reduced the cost of laboratory construction and management, which is of the first importance to realize the remote experiment teaching. Through virtual experiments, students' interest in knowledge is cultivated and innovation ability is enhanced. With the National Instruments Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite (NI ELVIS) and LabVIEW, we could take advantage of graphical programming and a complete suite of standard test instruments on computer and directly interface these instruments to circuits, which is the base of virtual experiment framework. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This conceptual paper underlines the necessity of research into sociotechnical systems in modern high-tech industries. Production of sophisticated products is foreseen to build the competitiveness of the advanced economies’ industrial sectors in the future. Increasingly, competitiveness in such industries depends on a complex interaction between social factors such as knowledge sharing, knowledge generation, learning and innovation, and technical factors such as robotization, automation and information systems. However, up to now, improvements and developments in these industries have tended to be biased towards the technology side. To balance this and to take into account the necessity of more effective human – machine interaction, and the need of knowledge sharing, learning and innovation, it proposes a mode for how to challenge highly automated, high-tech and knowledge based high-cost manufacturing, where: 1) State-of-the-art technology is necessary, but not sufficient; 2) state-of-the-art technology requires high level of competence and advanced organization, and 3) a joint organizational and technical perspective is needed in order to develop sustainable competitiveness through high performance work systems in high-tech manufacturing. Operational excellence in such niches requires companies that, through sophisticated practices of organization and management, are able to exploit systems of advanced manufacturing technology. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={As one of the hot topics in Business Process Management (BPM), process mining aims at constructing models to explain what is actually happening from different perspectives based on the process-related information that automatically extracted from event logs. Because the semantics of the data that recorded in event logs are not usually explicit, current mining approaches are somewhat limited. A number of studies have been carried out in the combination use of formalized semantic models and process mining technologies to obtain the semantic mining capability. However, among these researches, there is lack of a guideline that can clearly illustrate different stages during the semantic process mining. The objective of this study is to present a general framework, which unambiguously expresses the main stages of the semantic process mining. Based on this framework, an example about carbon footprint analysis is used to show the possibility of obtaining advantages from semantic process mining. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the application of the Internet and of technology in Intelligent Agriculture has become more and more widespread. In this paper, a kind of aquaculture remote monitoring system based on the Internet Android platform is introduced. Using the system with many sensor nodes, information (such as pH value, temperature, water level, dissolved oxygen and other environmental parameters) can be collected remotely by many kinds of sensors (such as a pH sensor, temperature sensor, water level sensor, and dissolved oxygen sensor), and then the analog data collected can be transformed to be digital data. The digital data can be sent to an Android mobile system by socket communication. In the Android mobile control interface the data received from pound can be exported into a SQLite database, and the data in the SQLite database can be exported into a SD card and stored in the format of TXT. The filename stored is formed with the information from the time when the TXT file is saved (such as year-month-data-hour-minute-second) in order to avoid the problem of having the file overwritten by a file with the same name file. Therefore, the user needs not designate the name of the saving TXT file. To the Android application, many control nodes can be controlled remotely. The system adopts CC2430 as the underlying management chip. Temperature measurement accuracy of the system can reach 0.5℃. In addition, pH measurement accuracy of the system can reach 0.3. A good control algorithm can achieve good control precision. In our system, in order to obtain more control precision, an intelligent fuzzy PID control algorithm is applied in the remote MCU control system. Dissolved oxygen is a very important parameter in aquiculture. In the system dissolved oxygen control precision can be controlled within ±0.3 mg/L. Moreover, the SOKCET communication is designed in an independent thread to the system. Thus, the reaction of the control system is very sensitive. The function of the system is not limited by time, regional, and climate conditions. The interface of the application is designed in the Android Mobile phone, so the user can handle the application flexibly and conveniently, and the user can browse data from the mobile phone, send remote control commands, and control the bottom water, pump water supply pump, and aerator in any location with an Internet connection. The IP address is exported into a SQLite database, so the IP data can be obtained automatically from the database by the system after the application is started, and it does not need input from the user repeatedly. Many mobile phone clients of the system can share a single server. Thus, the system has a very high price-performance ratio. After practical testing of the system, it has the advantages of simple operation, fully able to meet the need of aquaculture. c. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Building the local economy in terms of its structures and relationships is a major challenge for local authorities. Particularly difficult for regional competitiveness are the areas which focuses many companies with the same or a related sector. It is important to manage appropriately with their resources and production capabilities, which can bring benefits both for the region and the entities operating in a specific region. Identification of clusters is the initial action allowing to know the economic strength of its regional dimension. At the economic and political level, the cluster provides support for the government, which is able to capture the sense of the range of need for innovative activities in the region and this in turn, provides a strong incentive allowing to focus on clusters promotion. However, it is necessary to maintain the correct order, because only after the entrepreneurship and regional production systems analysis (e.g. in form of technological innovation) and finding a market imperfections, the government can decide, what actions are more likely to influence the improvement of regional economy. The lower levels of cluster should not be excluded, because the identification of actions based on cooperation is made there. This article presents a practical solution to identify potential cluster initiative for companies in the construction sector in one of the Polish provinces. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Innovations in modern economy are perfect example of developmental initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprises. The diversity of innovation concepts is a reflection of market demand, which is subjected to continuous process of adaptation to environment. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific barriers defining the framework of operation for innovative enterprises, particularly in relation to world development trends and globalization of markets. Innovative solutions are characterized by a wide diversity, which are a constant challenge for scientists studying and interpreting the occurring internal processes. Research of structures in these processes allowed creating many model solutions, which along with the economic transformations have evolved and are reflected in the present. Innovativeness of small and medium-sized enterprises is a matter relevant to the economic development. The European institutions that perform studies on innovativeness have shown that in many European countries level of innovativeness of SMEs is significantly below average. This problem also applies to the Polish enterprises and cover the whole economy since the SME sector is the overwhelming majority all economic entities on the market. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Construction is the top priority sector in the economy having a direct impact on the population’s standards of living. Progress in construction is one of the key indexes to evaluate the level of economic and social development of a country. During the latest decades, the abovementioned circumstances have made the cluster policy, which can dramatically influence the competitive strength of both the construction business and of the national economy as a whole a forefront. The particular feature of cluster policy is that it unites the economic and social policy of the State with management of business entities. The purpose of the present article is as follows: basing on the analysis of the construction clusters performance of various countries in Europe, highlight their common and specific features and propose directions for further development. The tasks of the present investigation are: firstly, identify specific features of construction clusters establishment and development; secondly, define the basic features of European construction clusters, thirdly, identify common and specific features of construction clusters in various countries of Europe, fourthly, propose directions for promotion of the cluster policy in regard to the sphere of construction. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The basic mechanisms are to flatten object(s) into a one-dimensional stream of bits, and to turn that stream of bits back into the original object(s); How to marshal an object to a remote server by value by using Visual Basic 2005 or Visual Basic. NET […] Because the whole object is being serialized to the server (marshaling by value), the code will execute in the server's process; Opyrchal, L., Prakash, A., “Effective Object Serialization in Java” (1999) 19th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops on Electronic Commerce and Web-based Applications/Middleware; (2012), http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization, Oracle Sun Developer Network(SDN), accessed on Feb 14; (2012), http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/pdf/serial-spec.pdf, Java™ObjectSerialization Specification, Revision 1. 4. 4, accessed on Feb 14; Ross, J.C., Chandran, P., (2008) Object Serialization support for object oriented java rocessors, , International Symposium on Information Technology, 2008.

abstract={With the development of database technology as well as the widespread application of Database management system, our capabilities of both generating and collecting data have been increasing rapidly. In addition, popular use of the World Wide Web as a global information system has flooded us with a tremendous amount of data and information. This explosive growth in stored or transient data has generated an urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can intelligently assist us in transforming the vast amounts of data into useful information and knowledge. The Data Mining technology brought forward. Data mining, also popularly referred to knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams. Data mining is a multidisciplinary field, drawing work from areas including database technology, machine learning, statistics, pattern recognition, information retrieval, neural networks, knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and data visualization. Database and Information Technology in the Decision Tree of is very important for the military. The Data Mining had been applied and studied in these years, and it has been applied in many domains successfully, such as business, finance and medical treatment. However, little is applied in communication construction scheme. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Project portfolio management involves multiple projects, of which risk regulation is different from the risk regulation of single projects especially in information technology application. In addition to considering each project's own risk, it must consider risk of project portfolio from a broader perspective. Issues of risk regulation are more complex, therefore its risk regulation requires new management approaches. This paper draws on Hall's three-dimensional management structure, respectively, from the four aspects: project portfolio management process, project portfolio risk regulation process, project portfolio risk regulation approach and project portfolio risk regulation organization, to establish a project portfolio risk regulation four-dimensional system (tlkc system) by applied-information technology. It provides a theoretical guidance for current risk regulation of project portfolio management, contributes project-oriented enterprises to establish suitable project portfolio risk regulation measures with their own circumstances, which is a necessary complement for project portfolio theory. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The article gives a short target analysis of efficiency assessment as applied to casting techniques. Basic principles of efficiency assessment are defined. Efficiency criteria are proposed to optimize and quantify the efficiency of various prospective and existing foundry technologies. Functional, energy and resource criteria are selected as prime criteria. However, as shown in the article, energy criteria are the most common for comparison and assessment of manufacturing practices. The article reflects the fact that consumption of electrical, mechanical and other kinds of energy in socially-relevant production may be highlighted as an important indicator of technification in modern society development. The study leads us to the conclusion that the most common indicator of technification of any kind (social, informational, manufacturing, etc) is the efficient use of social time. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Molded interconnect device (MID) technology is a key enabling technology with growing markets in automotive, communications, consumer electronics through integration with lighting and sensor technologies. The MID technology is yet to be explored for high temperature applications in automotive or consumer lighting. One of the hindering factors for such implementation in the serial production and time to market is the improper electronic and thermal packaging of the light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the MID substrates. This paper addresses the optimization of mold design, surface metallization and soldering process for the effective thermal management of the high-power LED systems. By using a simulation model, the thermal distribution and the resultant decrease in temperatures for varying forward electrical currents in high-power LEDs by design optimization is demonstrated. In addition, the optimization of solder process with respect to solder profile in context of vacuum vapor-phase soldering for void-free solder connections is discussed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland},

abstract={A method is put forward to overcome the disadvantages of traditional transit priority control which lack the information of residence time on bus station to achieve the better target of transit priority. Under the background that the SCM and RFID have been wildly used, and it has been a trend for intelligent traffic system to combine these two technologies organically. We establish a new combined forecasting model to predict the bus dwell time on bus station by collecting the bus station information, analyzing the time series features of bus dwell time and studying the mechanism of ES and RBF models. According to the prediction the signal is adjusted correspondingly. Thus we achieve the goal of enhancing traffic efficiency and simultaneously decrease the negative effect to the social vehicles. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the continuous development of video detection technology, the video analysis technology based on campus security has become an important part of the construction of safe campus. As the college students still are a group that has poor ability of security protection, campus security issue is closely related to the stability of society and family happiness, and has become a topic of concern to the whole society. The intelligent vision-based campus public safety monitoring system is an important means to achieve security monitoring, it can automatically analyze the video image sequence, and detect, track and identify objects in the monitoring scene without human intervention, and make high-level understanding and analysis of behaviors on this basis. Most of the existing visual monitoring systems can collect and store video data, and the real-time event detection task can automatically be generated through background analysis. Intelligent visual monitoring system should not only be used for accident investigation, but also be used to prevent potential disasters and accidents. The system is consisted of system management platform, event mining and analysis, monitoring and extraction of moving targets, forecasting and tracking targets. The paper makes an in-depth study on the application of intelligent visual detection technology on campus. Based on the intelligent visual video analysis, hidden Markov model is adopted in the paper for video event detection and analysis, motion features and shape features are taken as the observation data, and segmentation method is adopted to analyze the influence of video viewing height and angle on the detection result. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents a SOA and cloud computing based architecture for the distributed simulation of advanced flight management system (FMS). The architecture is designed to facilitate the fast simulation, validation and evaluation of different FMS system designs and functionalities with customized system configurations and widely varying aircraft equipage levels under various operation conditions. It is also intended to accommodate the potential evolutionary extensions of new avionics concepts and functionalities such as the future CNS/ATM and 4-D trajectory based technologies. To address the requirements of flexibility, scalability and reusability, the design of the simulation architecture takes advantage of the cloud computing and service oriented architecture (SOA) and the key enabling technologies are developed: simulation unit service encapsulation, simulation agent technology and simulation orchestration. Based on the proposed architecture associated technologies, the simulation components are encapsulated as services or accessed through agents, and the configuration of different FMS system frameworks and simulation tasks can be achieved through simulation orchestration. A prototype avionic simulation system that implements the SOA/cloud computing architecture is developed and illustrated with application cases. The applications demonstrate that the proposed architecture enables fast and scalable simulation of both existing and new FMS design and technologies. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Using China National Knowledge Infrastructure as the retrieve source, research papers of villages overlapping coal resources in recent 48 years are analyzed from the aspects of time distribution, periodical distribution, topic distribution etc. Then the content of research literature is analyzed qualitatively and the research progress is revealed. The results show that: The total amount of literature is less, the gross number is only 331; Besides core journals, the ordinary journals occupies the large proportion among the journals on which the research papers published; It can generally be divided into two research themes, that is coal mining technology under villages and relocation of village overlapping coal resources. Compared with the first, the study of village relocation is weak, and much more study is in a shallow level; The research subject is single, and the technical personnel and workers at the basic level of coal enterprises occupy a large proportion. Although the village relocation involves a lot of land issues, the research of land scholars on this field is not much. To strengthen and broaden the research of relocation of villages overlapping coal resources is the trend of future research in this field. Comprehensive and quantitative research from the land, management, ecology, environment and other multi angle, multi domain, multi discipline should be conducted. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={It is an important strategic choice for countries to develop low-carbon economy while dealing with climate change. The paper gives a forecast and analysis on population, economic development, technology, energy consumption and CO2 emissions variation in China before 2020 as setting the year 2007 as the base year by using IPAT model. Three scenarios of CO2 emissions are set including business as usual (BAU), energy efficiency improvement scenario (EEI), and low carbon scenario (LC). The result shows that the LC scenario is the most appropriate and the most feasible scenario for China to achieve the low-carbon development in the future. Assuming that China's future development follows the LC scenario, we give three suggestions of low-carbon transformation in China: technological innovation, energy structure optimization and policy advice. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of economy and technology, enterprises in eco-industrial symbiosis network (EISN) are facing enormous challenges. However, the emergence and development of EISN is closely tied with the energy management in eco-industrial park (EIP). This paper takes institution construction, allocation and new technology of energy management, cooperation performance and long-term cooperation relationship into research and develops a theoretical model of energy management accordingly. We conduct statistical analysis and Structural Equation Modeling using SPSS17.0 and AMOS17.0 based on 241 valid questionnaires from the EISN enterprise managers. The findings indicate institution, allocation and new technology are significantly positively related to cooperation performance, and cooperation performance has positive significant influence on long-term cooperation relationship. Based on the above results, the relative strategies and suggestions of strengthening energy management to enhance cooperation performance are given. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Electric power optic cables, as infrastructure facilities of the power communication system, are commonly affiliated to primary towers and poles of power transmission lines. And their safe and stable operation is one of important factors to guarantee the reliable power supply. At present, there are many kinds of professional application systems for equipment management in the field of Power System, so the level of their automation and intelligence is relatively high. But Management and Monitoring of outdoor lines are still staying the same as traditional methods, becoming a vulnerable part in smart grid. This paper introduces a network management system of electric power optic cables based on GIS and referred to the design method of Transmission Network Management System (TNMS). Its aims and several main developing technologies are also discussed. This system will play an important role in improving maintenance management and operational reliability for the power communication network. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of household appliances, the short of communication among them is more and more becoming a problem. At present there is no central point of control among the traditional home appliances, and we cannot access them through Internet. To solve these issues, home network is proposed to connect all the appliances, home PC and portable devices together using network technology. Controlling all the appliances through one single node(the home network gateway), home network makes life much simpler and convenient. There are several local area network technologies applicable to home network. Bluetooth technology is chosen in this paper as the home networking technology due to its many advantages over others. The implementation scheme of home control sub- network based on Bluetooth serial part profile(SPP) and the standards of Home Network Platform in China is proposed. According to actual application fields, the communication protocol architecture for this scheme is established by using appliance control protocol promoted by the manufacturers and universal device control protocol(UDCP) over SPP. Many management functions of appliance terminals are realized such as appending, login, operation, logout and alarming. Implementation methods of appliance terminal based on an entirely embedded single- chip manner and mobile control terminal which is realized by computer simulation are proposed. Analysis and solution of baud rate error brought by inaccurate crystal frequencies are presented. Further discussion about applying ad hoc technology to home control sub- network is carried out. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Based on the biological purification technology combined with the engineering measures, the enhanced nitrogen purification biological experiment is implemented in Wenyu River in Beijing. The water in the river mainly is the outflow from the sewage treatment plant, in which the ammonium (NH4-N) has been effectively removed for the deeply nitrification, while treatment of the nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) is incomplete due to the denitrification. The water has low C/N value and has poor biodegradability. In this study, aiming at the water feature of low C/N and poor biodegradability, the effective way to strengthen denitrification by some enhanced techniques, such as increasing the microorganisms number and biodegradability (ie, improved nitrogen ratio), changing denitrification rates and so on, has been studied. The experimental results show that under the condition of water flow (Q) as 15 ~ 27L/hr, hydraulic detention time as (HRT) 10 ~ 18h, concentration of nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) as 12.20 ~ 31.44mg / L, and total nitrogen (TN) as 14.50 ~ 34.71 mg / L, the removal rates of NO3-N and TN are over 30%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Investment in fixed assets is the main aspects of the national government to implement macro-control economy, and it is also the pillar of national economic growth. At the same time, the investment of enterprise fixed assets is to upgrade its commercial value and add the main source of income. However, in the current business competition, many enterprises especially private enterprises often make the mistake of judgment, resulting in too much investment, investment deviation and other consequences, which blocks the development of enterprises and the growth of the national economy. Firstly, this paper analyzes the computer aided technology, and constructs the fixed asset investment model based on database management technology, and does computer simulation on this model. The results show that the investment model can help enterprises to make reasonable investment decision and support theory, which promotes the enterprise value. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Connection management uses hash table. Hash function and data structure are both the bottleneck technology. For balancing computation cost and uniformity of hash function, three new hash functions were devised--the Random number Mapping XOR(RMX) Hash Function based on random number table mapping, the Segment Sampling XOR(SSX) Hash Function and Byte by Byte Shift XOR(BBSX) Hash Function based on segment generation and bit operations. The results show that these three functions are all better than IP Shift-XOR(IPSX) Hash Function on uniformity. This paper analyzed memory access performance and miss rate of multiple slots hash table, and presented the technical idea for shorting packet process time in connection management. Simulation for multiple slots hash table is described. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This article introduces the services and development of the Internet of Things, and analyzes the driving forces and obstacles behind such development. Looking at application types and the different development stages of the Internet of Things, this article categorizes its services into four types: identity related services, information aggregation services, collaborative-aware services, and ubiquitous services. For the first two types of services, applications and system framework are discussed; for the last two types, development trends are discussed. Services provided by the Internet of Things will gradually be integrated into human life and society; with the development of the Internet of Things, applications will evolve from relatively simple identity-related and information aggregation-related applications, to collaboratively-aware and finally ubiquitous applications. It will then be possible for the Internet of Things to be fully integrated with Internet and telecommunications networks. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={As a measure of demand-side management, efficiency power plant (EPP) can save energy and bring economic and environmental benefits to the power system, although the widely used EPP technology may have negative effect on both power system stability and operation costs. The concept of EPP and its related characteristics such as capacity, output curve, and cost were introduced, and a probabilistic production simulation model based on the equivalent energy function (EEF) method was established to analysis the impact and benefits of EPP. With a numerical example, a result is found that EPP can not only improve the reliability and load rate of power system, thus reducing the social costs of power outage, but also reduce the total production and operating costs of power system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

This paper does an empirical study on the influencing factors of food quality safety by application of DEMATEL method. We find out the casual factors and resultant factors of food quality safety; confirm the main influencing factors, and clear the interpretive structure relationship of the influencing factors. The results of this study suggest that morality, laws, and technology are the main three factors which influence food quality safety; relevant government departments play a crucial role in food quality safety; customers have a limited affect on the food quality safety. We propose the countermeasures to perfect China's food quality safety management from three aspects. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Deep processing of wood raw materials is the main field of its use. The forecast of timber industry development provides deep chemical processing and start-up of board materials production. In the available forest reserves the share of pulpwood and forestry engineering raw materials is up to 13 per cent. Some measures will contribute to settle the problems of increasing wood raw material complex use and green production of board wood composite materials. They include the improvement of existing technologies and implementation of progressive technologies and systems increasing the volume and quality of board output. One of the main directions will be the maximum possible use of all components of raw materials, when some production wastes are the raw material for the manufacture of new products. This will provide the balance in efficient environmental management. The priority will be given to creation of a relatively closed cycle of wood resources use. Particularly promising in achieving a balance of economic and environmental interests of society will be obtaining of cheap boards capable to be not worse than solid wood with minimum cost of natural resources and preservation of individual properties of each component. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Study found that users have utility was associated with a significant network community scale and influence use intention, did not find any subjective crowding out, user has evaluationed one network community is not affected by its size, but will respond to this. Thus, a new network community not only to attract users with high quality service, also want to provide the corresponding economic incentives, facilitate users to actively participate in. Online community has become a hot topic in recent years, for the economic value of network community, informatics, information management, computer and technology in areas such as scholars have carried out related research. Social aggregation of web community refers to the Internet, in the aggregate, people often discuss a common topic, have emotional communication between members and interpersonal network [1]. This paper mainly discusses new network scale and potential users to participate in the community association between, choose the theory of planned behavior research and set up the improved model. Online community is different from general economic entity's business model, which makes we can put the research mainly focus on the user participation, directly or indirectly economic incentives.

abstract={Along with the further open of the construction markets in China, the living environment of domestic small and medium-sized construction enterprises is dramatically changing and the competition they are facing is getting increasingly fierce. Consequently, studying the strategic transformation of them is becoming more and more urgent. First of all, the paper summarizes the existing development obstacles of small and medium-sized construction enterprises (EMCEs) in China. Next, the pivotal strategies are put forward looking forward to indicating the development direction of small and China's medium-sized construction enterprises, improving their market competitive power and making them keep sustainable development. As the economy advances, the construction markets goes through changes constantly as well [1]. Recent years, construction markets of China have been confronted with severe changes, such as growing outer competitions, technologic innovation, and complicated markets environment. To China's small and medium-sized construction enterprises with poor competitiveness, how to contend effectively, how to promote their adaptabilities to the changing markets and how to grasp the opportunities are crucial survival issues. Consequently, study on the strategic management of China's SMCEs is significant and imperative. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={It is known that, in our country, the current situation of water for farmland irrigation is low utilization, lack of management and a large number of serious water wastes. Therefore, the development of agricultural water-saving irrigation technology has become a top priority. According to the statistics survey of National Water Resources Development Ministry which published by Water Resources Bulletin, from 2000 to 2012, this paper analyzes the Chinese investment trend on water-saving irrigation, as well as the changeable situation of effective irrigation area. The results show that, during statistical periods, our country has paid attention to irrigation work and increased emphasis policy on agriculture. On this occasion, the irrigation investment increased 6 times and the promotion area increased by 14%. We can even draw a conclusion that China has promoted the development of agricultural water conservation work effectively. Moreover, in view of the existing multiple saving irrigation methods, this manuscript also analyzes the advantages and disadvantages in practical application, respectively. Putting forward the simulative suggestions to promote the water-saving irrigation technology and equipment provides a theoretical basis for future water-saving irrigation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Smart grid puts forward high requirements for the equipment to access authentication, which achieves openness and real-time performance in mart grid. The users' identities need to protect, in the meanwhile, identity authentication and data encryption should be efficient. According to the characteristics of smart grid, this paper proposed an identity-based aggregation signcryption scheme which combined pseudonymous ID with batch verification. The scheme adopted the pseudonym technology to achieve the user identity anonymity, and adopted the signcryption to complete digital signature and encryption in one time. This paper presented the aggregation signcryption for different multiple users by dynamic equation, which can compromise the security and computation overhead to meet the requirements of smart grid. This scheme can reduce the computational burden of aggregators with security of communication data. Moreover, this scheme solved the difficult problem of the management of pseudonymous ID, and improved the efficiency of the whole system. Therefore, this scheme meets the requirement of real time and high efficiency in smart grid. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Proper waste management in Malaysia is needed for the organic wastes such as pineapple leaf and cassava peel where affects the increase the amount of solid waste dump into landfill. Thus, to overcome this problem agro waste material can be constructed in many production industries to commercialize the use of alternative fibre for the paper industry. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of fibrous in pineapple leaf and cassava peel by production of alternative fibre based on chemical properties and surface morphology characteristic. This study conducted for the chemical composition by analysed by TAPPI Test method, Chlorination method and Kuchner-Hoffner method. Every chemical components analyse; Cellulose (Kuchner-Hoofner), Holocellulose (Chlorination method), Hemicellulose (Chlorination method), Hemicellulose, Ash content (T211-om-93), Lignin content (T222-om-98) and Sodium Hydroxide soluble (T203-om-88). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe and determine the morphological characteristic of both crops. The result indicates that pineapple leaf more suitable for becoming an alternative fibre than cassava peels. Pineapple leaves have a high Holocellulose content (85.7%), cassava peels 66%, followed by Cellulose pineapple leaf (66.2%), cassava peels (37.9%). However, hemicellulose content in pineapple leaf (19.5%) less than cassava peels (37.0%). Lignin content of pineapple leaf is lower (4.2%) compared to cassava peels (7.52%) in this study. From SEM images, cassava peel contained abundance fibre such as hemicellulose and cellulose that is held by the lignin in it and Pineapple leaves give a condensed composition of fibre structure. The chemical compositions and morphology study of pineapple leaf and cassava indicate pineapple leaf have a high percentage to be used as an alternative pulp in paper making industry, promoting the green technology. However, cassava peels make some of properties that can also be through for the paper industry. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The reserve proportion of thin coal seam in Sichuan Province is as high as 60%, of which the extremely thin coal seam mines with the coal thickness less than 0.6m take up 34.3% in the total number of Sichuan coal mines. Exploiting the extremely thin seam called Xiayuantan in Laoyingyan Coalmine confronts so many problems, such as small working space in coalface, difficulty in transporting, high labor intensity, poor production, and low stoping efficiency. Aiming at these problems, this paper puts forward the conventionally-mechanized coal winning technology, investigates the selection, matching, organization and management of equipment in mechanized mining face. Moreover, it demonstrates the rationality of associated equipment selection, that is, MG100-TP off-pan shearer is suitable for exploiting the extremely thin coal seam mechanically. There are less workers in the mechanized mining face, the raw coal production and the stoping efficiency have been enhanced, the roof condition of workface has been improved, serious injury and any other more serious accidents have been completely eradicated. The technology obtains remarkable economic effects and safety benefits. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The assessment of potential risks posed by PH value in clothing to consumers is of increasing concern worldwide. If the PH value is too high, it is harmful to skin. Some papers focus on hazard assessment and exposure assessment, using quantitative and semi-quantitative method, rather than assessment for the factors related to the PH value. In order to perform early-warning research and risk management, the quantitative risk assessment is used in this paper to analyze the imported textile testing data and find the factors related to the PH value. The data mining technique and K-means algorithm is the core of the method. It can be concluded that the disqualified textiles have relations with main fiber components and fabric color. Then cluster the data by K-means algorithm for every factor, define the different class as related danger level, respectively severe, moderate, light. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the popularity of electric vehicles, the impact of charging power on the original grid load is increasingly prominent. Electric vehicles can realize the benign interaction with power grid through the V2G technology. The mathematical model is solved with genetic algorithm in this paper based on the objective function as the minimization of daily charging cost. Constraint conditions such as maximum charge and discharge power limits and state of charge are considered. By analyzing the charge and discharge control of single car and the influence of electric vehicles' charge and discharge on power grid, it is concluded that charge and discharge control strategy proposed in this paper can optimize the operation of the power grid and realize win-win situation of the user and the power grid with the time-of-use electricity pricing mechanism. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Thermally reactive materials have caused many serious accidents involving storage and transportation, due to being thermally reactive. The safe storage and management of these materials still is a critical problem in many countries. We studied the thermal hazard of thermal reactive materials, such as a propellant, by employing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) non-isothermal tests and isothermal tests, and then comparing the kinetic parameters by isothermal and non-isothermal of kinetics, avoiding the mistaken results of the single thermal analysis model. The chosen approach was to obtain reliable kinetics of thermal decomposition by safety and effective technology by modelling method, which acquired the safety parameters of storage condition that could be applied as thermal reactive materials' safer design during storage safety conditions and relevant operations. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose - Currently, the device development process for assisting disabled dogs does not provide the best performance and there are only few product developments.This research aims to develop an innovation development process for dogs with two disables hind legs, especially dogs in Thailand, which can be domestically produced domestically and can meet the needs of users at an appropriate price. Design/methodology/approach - Research methodology is divided into 4 steps: literature review and framework building, action research, innovation product acceptance and satisfaction test, and test of better life qualify of dogs with two disabled hind legs. This research explores both public and private veterinary hospitals by inquiring the needs and comments from twenty dog anatomy, metallurgy and design experts as well as innovation development process experts and leaders towards the usage of this product. Finding - Innovation development processes for dogs with two disabled hind legs in both case studies are similar. In order to build an effective development, the critical success factor is a new mutual work in creating an innovation development of such product for public veterinary hospitals, business owners, and associations that support disabled dogs. The researchers have developed the process in the areas where they potentially expect to gain support from public veterinary hospitals, business owners, and associations that support disabled dogs in order to reduce redundant steps and focus on the most beneficial steps which are important for the development. This research proposes a 5D model for innovation development process for dogs with two disabled hind legs, which includes Discovery, Definition, Design, Development and Deployment. This 5-D process is useful for the developers in producing the quality of product development. Practical implications - The finding is important for management of organization strategies regarding the innovation development process for relevant industries. Originality/value - This research explains a connection between strategies, innovation development factors and process, and R & D concerns for innovation development process for dogs with two disabled hind legs, both in public and private sectors. The 5D process provides an innovative 5D model of product innovation development process to improve the quality of product development and reduce redundant working steps. The collaboration of public and private sectors will be shown in each process with 5D model tools. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={For the hot spots problem caused by the number of replica could not satisfy the soaring request from users, we present a Cloud Computing storage resource replica dynamic scheduling scheme based on HDFS. There are two sub algorithms which is the number of replica dynamic adjustment algorithm and replica placement algorithm. This scheme could improve system stability and file access through put. The experiment result shows this optimized scheme lower the access delay obviously than the original scheme with some cost of storage resource and network workload. For the problem of metadata management, this paper introduced a distributed metadata management scheme. This scheme distributed metadata into several name node according to their ability, and provides an efficient inquiry algorithm for metadata to improve system availability and reliability. The experiment result shows the multi-name nodes system with this metadata management scheme could improve the performance than the original system facing the huge metadata operation requests. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of international trade,many companies begin to use the electronic mode in trade, orders,negotiation, contracts, customs clearance, logistics and other business. Information technology could improve efficiency and reduce operating costs. However, for the complexity of international trade business, it is necessary to communicate with many business-oriented management and government departments. Thus, how to deal with cross-border large scale identity authentication between the users and the systems becomes a difficult issue. This paper discusses the cloud certification service platform constructed with the interconnection based on PKI,multi-level authentication and single window service mode and other technologies. The scheme could make full use of the existing infrastructure in transnational trade. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet and virtualization technology, cloud computing, which providing users with on-demand services, has become a research hotspot. Under the environment of cloud computing, the datacenter, consisted by hardware and software, is a loosely coupled resource sharing architecture. The existing cloud computing's inadequacies are as following three aspects: 1. For lacking of real adequate and effective transaction of global bidirectional-way selection, the revenue of most of cloud resource provider is too low. 2. Since not fully considering the scheduling of multi-dimensional cloud resources, existing cloud computing's utilization for multi-dimensional cloud resource is too low. 3. Because existing cloud datacenter does not fully consider the energy consumption of communication between the cloud tasks, its energy consumption is too high. Resource scheduling is a major research direction of cloud computing. First, we make a in-depth investigation and analysis of the research status of cloud computing resource scheduling, and then focus on resource scheduling method to reduce the energy consumption of cloud computing data center. Finally we set an important future research direction of cloud computing resource management research in order to provide a useful reference for cloud computing research. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Based on data extraction, build the co-author network which maps 511 nodes connections, the nodes represent authors and the links represent the connections with one another coauthors. Within the network, we use software UCINET to analyze its properties. Furthermore, we apply the grey relational analysis method into measuring the author influence and impacts, after extracting five indexes which are the degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector and the number of joint publications. By combining network topology and the algorithm,it will be much better to tap and identify information between authors. Furthermore, it can provide the development of science and technology management and technology with some important guidance. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Computer-based interlocking system is the product of the development of information technology, computer technology and communication technology. With the railway station personnel controlling all the signal interlocking systems around the station, computer-based interlocking system could take better control of the station and train branches. This paper introduces the development of computer-based interlocking system in China, presents its advantages and disadvantages, and gives a brief analysis of risk management of its life cycle. Computer-based interlocking system has been widely applied in the railway transportation management in China. As a result, it is necessary to carry out the risk management of each process of the computer-based interlocking system life cycle. After 20 years' study of computer communication technology and application of high security of computer controlling system in railway transportation, regular signal service of railway station, railway branches, train movement and traffic safety is guaranteed. The analysis and study of computer-based interlocking system life cycle help to make an intensive study of each process of the life cycle and have a directive function to the risk management of life cycle of computer-based interlocking system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Human population has always been advocated to use exosomatic energy, exist in abundance in Mother Nature. As of today world's population has reached to 7.1 billion, which will be exceeding 8.0 billion by 2050. To fulfill the energy demand of increasing population, world existing energy should be increased by &gt;50% by 2050. The question is do we have enough energy resources to meet the future energy demand? Secondly, the use of reserved gas, oil, coal and other carbonbased energy sources would continue to emitgreenhouse gases which are estimated to warm up the world by 20C by 2020, raising the sea level which will dwindle the world cultivable land. This paradigm shift has called foreffective, sensitive and advanced technologies dealing with the production, harvesting, conversion and distribution of renewable energy to meet the future energy needs. This paper has highlighted the potential applications of carbon nanotube (CNT) based composites to harvest the unlimited solar energy into electrical, mechanical and other forms of useful energy for human benefits. The competitive performances of CNTs in solar cells would build multibillion dollar energy market using green chemistry principles, reducing green house emission and ensuring enough energy for the future generations. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Pure and clean water is a must for living a healthy life. However, the increasing influence of urbanization, industrialization, domestic and agricultural activities, is continuously adding both conventional and newly emerging pollutants to the earth's water bodies, seriously affecting both the terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna. Thus water pollution has become a major issue in the global perspectives. In the last few decades, numerous methods, such as chemical precipitation, filtration, oxidation, ion exchange treatment and adsorption have been proposed for the purification of contaminated water. Among these methods, adsorption has taken an important position in water purification technology. This is because of its ease of operations, cost-effective maintenance, and availability of adsorbents in various forms with high surface area, porous structure and specific surface reactivity. Instead of having many attractive properties, many adsorbents have failed to achieve a good acceptability at commercial levels. In the recent years, nanotechnology approaches have introduced nano-adsorbent which is capable of removing water pollutants more efficiently. In this review, various water treatment techniques with their shortcomings followed by efficiency of adsorption and nano-adsorbent for pollutant removal are discussed with green chemistry perspectives. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Recycling of the nutrient solution used to irrigate fruit and vegetables in greenhouses can increase water use efficiency and reduce the contamination of local water sources. The nutrient solution cannot be recycled without treatment because of potential contamination of the entire plant system with bacteria, viruses, and/or fungi. Ozonation, pasteurization and chemigation are the typical techniques used, but are often expensive and not always effective[1]. Slow sand filter (SSF) is a technology that is relatively inexpensive to purchase and operate. Data was collected from two SSF to verify treatment efficacy and associated hydraulic characteristics. The SSF was able to consistently produce water with a turbidity less than 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) and with the infiltration capacity to treat 0.27 m3 m-2 h-1 of greenhouse effluent; which, equates to treating 3,600 L d-1 of drainage water from a 1,000 m2 greenhouse. The recovery rate for the filter was an average of 110 minutes. Ideal growing conditions for bacteria responsible for the treatment of the water in the SSF included warm and consistent water temperature, high nutrient content, and organic loading in the water. The SSF was able to sustain the hydraulic loading rate of 0.27 m3 m-2 h-1 for 16 days. At the end of this period the organic layer that was present at the sand/water interface reduced the infiltration rate because of the formation of the Schmutzdecke layer (SL). An air/water jet cleaning system scoured the SL and suspended it so that it could be drained. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is one major concern in Cambodia due to complicated problems from waste sector. Until now, because of poor MSWM, solid wastes have produced high pollution, like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are the substances of greenhouse gas affect to climate change. Therefore, this study was undertaken to estimate and compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from municipal solid waste in different cities namely; Phnom Penh, Battambang, and Siem Reap of Cambodia. GHG emission was calculated through Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculator 2006 based on secondary data of 2009 for all cities. In order to reduce the GHG emission, four scenarios were proposed with different waste treatment technologies such as composting, anaerobic digestion, waste reduction at landfill by separating waste for recycling before disposal off in landfill, and landfill with gas recovery as well. Additionally, the multiple benefits of implementing the proposed scenarios may include reduction of GHG emission, promotion of energy saving for landfill operation, and promotion of the renewable energy concept like electricity. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Magnetic pulse production methods such as forming, joining or separating demonstrate innovative high-speed processes. Such processes can be realized using a capacitor and an appropriate tool coil for forming and welding processes. The process strain rates, which can amount to 20, 000 s-1, increase the formability of metallic materials significantly. Magnesium and aluminium alloys find a wider application in the automotive industry due to their light weight potential. Through the low density of these materials, the vehicle weight can be reduced considerably. Due to the hexagonal lattice of magnesium alloys industry-relevant deformation in metal forming processes can only be achieved in hot forming processes. The high-speed forming allows a significant increase of deformability of this alloy. The use of dissimilar metals in an assembly requires the development of innovative joining methods. Apart from being used form and force closure the magnetic pulse welding and adhesive bonding material with different partners is possible. Currently at the Institute for Machine Tools and Factory Management (IWF), TU Berlin, various research topics in the field of pulsed magnetic are investigated. The magnetic pulse sheet metal forming of magnesium alloys at room temperature is investigated in a basic research project. A defined demarcation of high-speed forming with respect to the quasi-static deformation is done by means of hardness measurements in the deformation zone. For this purpose a suitable experimental setup with different matrices is constructed. The experimental results of the pulse magnetic deformation are iteratively compared with simulation results. The aim is to develop a new material model which gives a precise prediction about the high-speed process. In the field of magnetic pulse welding, both basic research and industry-related research projects conducted at the IWF. The process requires an adapted tool coil geometry that meets the requirements of the weld geometry. Different coil geometries and weld geometries and possible applications are presented by way of example, the welding quality is quantified by means of different analytical methods. The material microstructure in the weld zone, characterized by light and scanning electron microscopy shows the typical features of a shock welded joint, as also observed in explosive welding. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The megatrend electric mobility induces a significant demand for high energy and high power secondary batteries. Currently lithium-ion technologies are the most promising solution for electrochemical energy storage in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) [1; 2]. Core factors that influence the quality, the performance and the cost of high energy lithium-ion batteries are production technologies, quality measurement techniques and quality management methods [3; 4]. For this reason the Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management set up the Research Center for the Production of High-Energy Battery Cells (R-PHEB). In this research center production technologies are investigated according to industrial requirements. Research thrust areas are: first, process and assembly system design; second, quality assurance and management; and third, value chain analysis and design. The mass production of large lithium-ion cells for EV applications is an infant industry; new production technologies are often used in this field [5]. Hence, the influences of those processes on product properties are not known and the product quality can be evaluated only after the final production step. In order to obtain a resource efficient and economic production of lithium-ion cells, the correlations between the cell performance, the cell quality, the production processes and the assembly system design need to be revealed. This paper focuses on fundamental investigations of the process chain for the production of lithiumion cells. It introduces a product-and a process-model, both of which specifically match the requirements in the field of battery production. The models can be used individually to describe the product structure or the process chain. Additionally they can be linked via a correlation matrix in order to visualize the dependencies between the requirement specifications of lithium-ion cells and the manufacturing processes (including process alternatives). Both models are based on a layered structure and contain information about battery cell design, battery type and production processes-covering all tasks from coating the electrode coils to the start-of-operation of the cells. The product-model, the process-model and the correlation matrix will be implemented in a database, which-in the future-can be used for the methodical design of assembly systems as well as to investigate the correlations between process parameters and output quality. Furthermore, the database can assist when evaluating established process chains or preparing make-or-buy decisions in the context of battery cell production. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Large warehouse, being considered as the general type of storage granary in China, has proven to be the key post-harvest management in the fight against food security for long period's storage. Soybean (Glycine max) seeds bulk stored under ambient condition (the control) and mechanical ventilation (the test) for 12 month were analyzed for some physico-chemical characteristics to investigate the effect of storage condition on the quality of soybeans. The results indicated that the samples storied in texted storehouse had a lower level of the free fatty acid content. There was a notably higher water solute protein content compared with the samples in controlled storehouse, which effectively reduce the deterioration of water-soluble protein quality and respiration rates. These results provide convincing evidence that tested warehouse obviously superior to conventional storage, which can delay the quality deterioration of soybean seeds quality and has good prospects for application. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), as an innovative inventory management, has been concerned by more and more scholars and corporations. When conducting VMI model, managers normally forecast demand, through exponential smoothing method, to compute order quantity or order release time. However, the exponential smoothing method is very dependent on the selection of smoothing coefficient. Moreover, with the development of technology and science, increasing categories and decreasing producing cycle of products, manager's lack of historical data, exponential smoothing method fails to forecast demand perfectly. This paper applies exponential smoothing method, which is based on the idea of dynamic programming, to forecast customer demand and determine order release time, so as to keep or approximately keep service level remain at targeted service level. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

From World War II to the mid-1990s, China's construction industry has been used in decade's rather traditional manual practices, with respect to three decades of rapid social change and economic development is concerned, it experienced only very limited changes. Meanwhile, in the last decades of the baby boom in the past, our country is about to enter the lack of young people can meet, in the near future, a large number of factories will face labor shortages issue. Housing Industrialization have to reduce on-site construction time, reduce re-decoration and other advantages, to become an effective way of building low-carbon housing[1]. In this case, some far-sighted persons proposed architectural concept of industrialization, which is the application of modern scientific and technological means, with advanced centralized large-scale industrial production to replace the existing decentralized way backward handicraft production build buildings. This not only improves the quality of construction can also be managed through industrialization means to improve efficiency and save labor, thus promoting the development of China's construction[2]. Residential construction is our largest, most demanded type of construction can be expected in the near future, China will be large quantities of industrialized housing mushrooming. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Industrial boiler systems are used in manufacturing plant to generate steam for the purpose of production. The current boiler feed exhibits the feedwater chemical parameters that are not consistent with the acceptable water chemistry limits. Around 60% of damages of power plant equipment occur due to deviation from the normal water chemistry. The Six Sigma DMAIC method was used to investigate and prioritize the main issues revolving around these parameters-namely Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control. Based on this case study of the plant, it was found that the leading issues are that there is insufficient pretreatment to remove silica. It was found that there has been significant improvement to water quality to almost all the investigated parameters namely the Silica content, Hardness content and P-alkalinity in the water. The results of this study have proven that Six Sigma is useful in creating sustainable improvement in process in an organization. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Mass customization (MC) is an advanced production mode in the 21st century that combines two opposite production patterns -- customization production and mass production. It keeps low production cost and fast delivery time, while meeting individual customer's needs. Firstly, via analyzing the typical production management patterns (material requirement planning (MRP)/ just in time (JIT)), and based on the two strategies of modularization and postponement, the paper presented a push/pull manufacturing model to meet the demands of MC. This model integrates the two different production patterns (push and pull) to reduce inventory, production costs and production time. Before the customer order decoupling point (CODP), common components and selective components are produced via push of plan in presence of inventory. After the CODP, customization production is conducted by pull of orders. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Moreover the year 2011 represents a turning point since until 2010, the extent of renewable generation was mostly affected by the behavior of the hydro source, while in 2011 the hydro output is stable and the new renewables (solar, wind and biomass) increase. At the same time the effort of management science to assessing efficiency is reaching its goals with the use of Data Envelopment Analysis, a mathematical programming technique able to estimate the comparative efficiency of a set of units which, though distinct production processes and technology, take a given level of inputs to produce a given quantity of outputs. In this paper the efficiency of renewable energy technology (photovoltaic, wind, biomass, hydro) is evaluated with Data Envelopment Analysis at regional level in Italy considering investment and operating costs as inputs and installed power capacity, energy intensity and the CO2 avoided as outputs. For each sources the more and the less efficient region is selected and an accurate analysis of the obtained results is outlined. The policy implications of the obtained results conclude the paper. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In order to study the color matching effect of ink-jet printing press under different color management systems. I applied EFI and ORIS series color management soft wares separately to the same Epson ink-jet printer and optimized the proofing with exploring the most reasonable settings. After that, I will compare the gamut and color difference in a special color management module, and also make a contrast with a standard color gamut to check the color matching effect. The results show that the average color differences of the two soft wares are all below 1.0. However, differences measured by ORIS is lower, falling to 0.5 only, which implies the proofing under ORIS color management is more similar to the presswork and more stable. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Biowaste composting is one of the main technologies of waste management in Poland. Composting process run is influenced by many parameters which can accelerate or slow down the phenomena. However, there is no information about the influence of humidity of the air pumped to composted mass on process run. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of air humidity on parameters of composting process. The results have showed that there is no significant influence of the air humidity on a dynamics of composting process. Even in case when the difference in air humidity exceeded 60%, the temperature remained similar. The research proved utility of new kind of temperature sensors. Temperature analysis in the whole volume of composting chamber allows to control composting process in much more effective way. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Despite the recent advances in space technologies, electrical power systems still are challenging researchers developing small satellites for low earth orbit use. In order to supply their subsystems, these satellites can only use the power stored on board from solar energy. Therefore, the electrical power system should ensure a maximum exploitation of energy sources and optimize the distribution of the available electrical power. In this context, Research Group of Intelligent Machines Laboratory in Tunisia developed a new intelligent electrical power subsystem to be used for pico satellites. This subsystem is based on fuzzy logic allowing a faster energy storage and better and efficient energy distribution. The intelligent electrical power subsystem was successfully integrated in ERPSat-1 pico satellite. In addition, the simulation has shown better results compared to other used methods in the previous electrical power systems used for small satellites. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={"As energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important feature, buildings are expected to comply with several criteria and requirements and these criteria are changed and extended with time. The Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and Commission on the energy performance of buildings and the Directive 2010/31/EU request Member States to apply minimum energy performance requirements. These minimum requirements are indeed applied all over the European Union and should be regularly reviewed. Our research aimed at clarifying whether optimum cost and/or energy efficiency represents the next step towards actual energy efficiency. The Directive brought forth an aspect that should have been prioritized long ago already: Are the construction and refurbishment of buildings in Europe economically feasible? The methodology prescribed by the Directive leaves several questions open and provokes further research. The methodology uses costs only as the basis for examining energy consumption and emissions related to already existing, newly constructed or refurbished buildings or refurbishment options. Optimum cost does not necessarily correspond to optimum energy or environmental performance. The price of materials and equipment built in does not always reflect the energy built in or environmental advantages. Subsidies to promote energy efficiency may bias optimum costs. Viewing optimums from the broader aspect of energy consumption, proper results are only yielded by analyses completed for the entire life cycle of buildings. This way, we may decide which characteristics attribute more to a low energy and emission status, i.e. state-of-the-art construction technology or traditional, natural constructing methods such as those used for "conservative eco buildings."
