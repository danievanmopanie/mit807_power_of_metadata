abstract={The food crises of the 21st century are characterized by the presence of multidirectional obstacles of a socio-economic and organizational nature in the structure of international relations that function on the problems of maintaining a wide range of export-import supplies of raw and related resources. This situation is caused by the specifics of the international epidemiological situation with the widespread incidence of COVID-19, which leads to the adoption of extraordinary measures to counteract the further aggravation of this situation. Additional factors in the formation of food crises are the complication of the full functioning of natural-artificial aggregates of elements that make up the system of agro-industrial production, formed within the framework of national socio-economic systems, as well as in the structure of international food production and consumer relations. The main means of overcoming these crises consist in the development and further implementation of rational resource-saving technologies for the functioning of the agro-industrial complex with the extraction of various components from the environment, subject to the minimum possible negative impact on it. Thus, the most important ways to overcome the food crises, which are aggravated by the spread of COVID-19, are the sustainable partnership of state management structures and representatives of the private sector of the economy through modern electronic and digital communications in the development of advanced resource-saving technologies for the production of high-quality food, providing comprehensive public-private financial support for the production of high-quality food, as well as comprehensive compliance with epidemiological safety standards. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The stability of modern socio-economic processes is determined by the rational regulation of the relationship between the optimal provision of production and consumer relations and the scientifically grounded use of the components of the natural environment. In this regard, by analyzing and summarizing various methods of obtaining economic products in demand on the market, as well as by methods of statistical and economic analysis of multidirectional information data, the need to find a multidimensional organizational and management structure that combines productive forms of use and disposal of available production technologies is revealed, subject to full compliance conditions of the minimum possible impact on the natural environment. The main goal of green management is to obtain the maximum possible economic and production effects, which is expressed in the form of the maximum possible level of profit with the maximum satisfaction of consumer demands with the maximum possible extraction of raw materials and energy from the minimum possible amount of components of the natural environment. As a result of the study, it was established that in conditions of violation of natural-natural relationships and natural-climatic conditions of life of modern society, green management is a productive system for the development of promising forms and methods of economic activity in conditions of natural and climatic instability with the receipt of innovative economic products. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Improving the tillage system will stabilize the agricultural sector of the Krasnoyarsk Region and meet the growing demand for agricultural products. The principles of minimizing mechanical tillage and preserving plant residues on its surface are the basis of the technology of conservation agriculture. Among the new agro-ecological advantages of the technology is the reduction of dependence on weather conditions thanks to effective moisture conservation. Improvement of the soil structure by reducing the pressure on it, partial replenishment of natural fertility by reducing (by 25-30%) the rate of humus mineralization. It is based on soil fertility management, minimum and combined tillage; differentiated fertilizer system. Zero sowing on the predecessor stubble - an element of technology - contributes to the accumulation of moisture, disruption of the plough-pan, an increase in the microbiological activity of the soil, etc. Presowing seed preparation is a technological technique that can increase the yield of wheat. Seed disinfection techniques significantly affect the development and spread of diseases in spring wheat crops. A systematic, scientifically grounded approach to phytosanitary rehabilitation of agrocenoses will ensure the prevention of chemical contamination of soil and agricultural products, an increase in yield (by 15-20%), a decrease in production costs per unit of produced products (by 10-15%), and an increase in production profitability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article describes an innovative survey methodology through the use of optical survey camera OPTV (Borehole Digital Optical Televiewer). This camera allows us to record the borehole wall colour image at 360° and to keep the orientation with respect to the North. Through the use of OPTV surveys, the fractures present in the rocky mass can be recognized via means of sinusoidal curves readable on the image. From the abovementioned curves, it is then possible to assume the inclination, immersion, and thickness of the discontinuities. Furthermore, from the virtual core, it is possible to analyze the lithological changes and the commodities varieties characterizing the site. On the basis of the above-mentioned information, 3D models can be then created through innovative technologies, so to visualize the geological and geotechnical models in an easier way to read and understand. The mapped fractures can be integrated with the most modern techniques of Discrete Elements Numerical modeling, utilizing the dimensions, orientation, and positioning values during the model realization phase. Through practical examples of representations of the collected data, the survey methodology is described in detail in the article, together with the used technologies and the potentialities of the acquired information exploitable during the interpretation phase. The proposed methodology approach allows a better digital management of the data, encouraging a more completed and easier usage of the information with clear application potentialities in the field of rock mechanics and when facing geotechnical challenges. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={It is important to acknowledge the interdependent relationships between the economic and the environment system in achieving sustainable development. The environmental system provides typically four classes of services to the economic system: the natural capital for production, amenity services, basic life support services, and waste sink services. High investment in technology, programmes, projects, or any measures related to the recycling concept in the circular flow of production and consumption relationships should be given more concentration in the future waste management plan and policies. This is because the mass of waste generated from the production and consumption relationships is continually increasing as the population grows, leading to a more polluted environmental system. This study examined the households' perspectives on the potential improved municipal solid waste management system in their residential area. Two study sites were compared to their households' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the waste management system. By using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) approach, the study concluded that the economic value of the improved municipal solid waste management services in the study sites ranged from MYR 15.42 to MYR 29.67 per month, which on aggregate, ranged from MYR 13.3 million to MYR 117.7 million per year. These economic values indirectly indicated the amount the population preferred to pay as the cost to reduce the impacts of improper management of municipal solid waste. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Oil palm trees contribute economic income to the national and community by generating various types of productions. This will cause an expansion of the area for the plantation of oil palm seeds, then contributes to the stability in distributing good quality oil to accommodate the growing population. Furthermore, degradation occurs when the planting of oil palm trees increases rapidly, especially the occurrence of uncontrolled oil palm cultivation. The degradation can cause loss of soil nutrients due to soil erosion. The lack of macronutrients, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) and Magnesium (Mg) on oil palm tree may impact on its growth which includes the quality of crops. Traditional approach to detect macronutrients, can also lead to some improper control in turn leads results in reduction in yield. The existing system has given limited information of dataset and slower classification performance due to limited functions. With the adaptability of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, oil palm tree growth data and fertilization management can be utilizing effortlessly and effectively. The context of conceptual framework comprises the IoT technologies, image processing, machine learning and deep learning which focuses on environmental factors that affecting the young oil palm tree growth that involve temperature, humidity, soil moisture content, light and nutrient. Thus, a study of IoT, machine learning and deep learning for smart fertilization management of oil palm trees is suggested helping and raise the efficiency of oil palm trees management in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Analysis of environmental changes is a key to knowing the state of vulnerability of the environment. However, in recent years, environmental changes are often evaluated based on one factor per research. In this study, several factors will be integrated to get an evaluation of the environment that consider the influences of many natural factors at the same time. In this study, spatiotemporal analysis of environmental changes based on integrated remote sensing indexes in river basin of Kelantan will be conducted to evaluate the environmental condition of the Kelantan river basin. It will also help in evaluating the environmental health of the Kelantan River. The Kelantan River basin is an important source of water to Kelantan's population, and up to 2014, Kelantan River basin is also housing about 68.5% of the Kelantan population lives within the Kelantan River Basin. This means that any negative changes of the environment of the Kelantan River basin could affect the community severely. Hence, the environmental quality evaluation throughout the time is needed in order for any protection and management enforcement if necessary. The process of environmental evaluation includes the usage of indexes, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wetness index (WI), albedo, salinization index (SI), and land surface temperature (LST) will be used to calculate the data obtained from Landsat TM and Landsat 8 from the year 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016, and 2020. Data processing, compilation, verification, calculation and analysis will be conducted using ArcGIS 10.3. The result of this study will give the condition status on the environmental that has happened since 2000 until 2020 in Kelantan River Basin. The information gained will be helpful assistant in creating rules and regulation, formulation, protection and management effort to conserve the environment of the river basin. This study will also show that by using remote sensing technology, environmental changes of certain area can be evaluated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The creation of reservoirs on watercourses leads to significant changes in the hydrological regime of water bodies: it allows to smooth out the peaks of maximum water discharge during the flood period and to regulate low runoff. The reservoirs with a significant storage capacity enable to solve a wide range of water management problems, among which are: using the falling water energy for hydropower purposes, ensuring uninterrupted water supply and navigation. In view of the fact that dams are generally managed by hydropower companies, the regime for regulating downstream water mass discharges is often determined by the schedule of daily electricity consumption. Intraday changes in the volume of water discharge through the hydroelectric units of hydroelectric power plants form multidirectional flows in the upstream, which can affect the work of other water users. This paper examines the impact of intraday changes in flow rates of downstream water discharges on the dynamic and physical properties of the water mass in the area of the drinking water intake heads of the city of Perm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the emergence of industries, advent of new agriculture technologies and increase in water consumption of domestic households, there has been an escalation in the consumption of the underground water in the state of Gujarat. In this research paper, the authors have analysed the legal policies to regularize the availability of underground water in Gujarat. The authors have conducted an empirical study based on three districts of Gujarat i.e., Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad and Baroda to find out the usage of underground water for domestic purposes and also to explore what alternative methods are adopted by these households to replenish the underground water used by the residents of these districts. The authors have concluded that majority of people are relying on underground water along with the water supplied by the city corporation and scarcely any household from the above-mentioned districts have a system to replenish the underground water through mode like rainwater harvesting. Further, the authors have summarized and recommended a few strategic steps that can be sorted for underground water problem in Gujarat. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The methods for the disintegration of coal-bearing rock massif have been developed that allow eliminating the areal hanging of roofs in the longwall faces and their dynamic impacts on mechanized complexes, to ensure the safety of reused mine workings in the coal face operation area, and also to create a system of cracks in the coal seam upper side along the entire length of the face and increase the efficiency of preliminary degassing without creating a large number of intermediate mine workings. A technique for the numerical study of reservoir properties of rocks containing a system of cracks is proposed. An algorithm and software for creating two-dimensional stochastic systems of cracks with a given distribution of the coordinates of their centers, lengths, and orientations are developed. Based on the finite element method, the problem of fluid filtration in a fractured massif is numerically investigated. The influence of parameters of crack systems on the filtration properties of the medium is shown. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Integrated research approach joining the David Ricardo theory of differential rent, linear programming theory and GIS technology used for developing the methodology for differential rent determination and calculations for forest lands in the way similar as to agricultural ones. Special linear programming model was developed and resolved to obtain the rent estimations on the base of information offered by GIS data base on forest plots productivity and location regarding transportation network characteristics. Implementations of forest rent estimations for forest lands value assessments, forest management and economics was discussed. Rent values was calculated as an example for Lisino training and experimental forest of Saint-Petersburg State Forest Technical University. As a result of implementation of rental approach for forest resources assessments the value of forest lands significantly elevates as much as approximately on 5 times. Forest rent as an extra income originated from forest plots natural characteristics suggested to be used as a main source of so-called "long-money"needed for investments in forestry especially in boreal zone with long rotation period. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

funding_text 1={One of the most innovative ideas or the robotechnic systems is use of robots in the over ground area, providing full absence of contact with the forest soils. It can completely change forestry. Perhaps, one can find use of such technologies as difficult at first. Yet, every year the technologies get smarter and more complex. Scion scientific research institute, New Zealand leads active experiments in this area [13]. They offered as one of possible solutions using such machines in the areas with difficult access where regular forest machines can’t reach, e.g. mountain regions, steep slopes. The above-ground wood processing machine was designed with the financial support of Scion Institute, Ministry of primary industry of the New Zealand and Levy Trust Forest Fund (FGLT) [14]. Students of the Canterbury University created working RC machine in 2013 that could move from tree to tree.},

abstract={With the depletion of easily accessible deposits and the transition of the industry to the Industry 4.0 principles the need for more than just increasing production volumes and applying new technologies including automation and modern digital technologies, but also for solutions to a number of organizational and socio-economic problems faced by this sector. All these problems are in one way or another related to the change in the business model of extractive companies. Under these conditions, studying the features of the business models of the major Russian companies in the extractive sector under the transition to the Industry 4.0 is a relevant research task. The purpose of this article is to characterize the features of business models of large Russian extractive companies operating in the fuel and energy complex and to describe the possible directions of their transformation under the influence of Industry 4.0. Our analysis of the business models of the major Russian mining companies and comparison to their foreign counterparts showed a certain conservatism in Russian companies and the lag in the implementation of digital platforms, despite the interest of companies' management in using digital technologies. This is largely due to the low willingness of most companies to complicate their business models and to implement digital transformation. Such trends can be explained by the fact that companies tend to choose a vertically integrated model. They are in the early stages of digital transformation and mainly focused on operational aspects. In most Russian mining companies, the level of automation of production and administrative processes is low, and the use of digital technologies is still limited mainly to pilot projects. To achieve a systemic effect from digitalization, it is necessary to combine the efforts of all interested parties - the government, companies, the innovation community, and academic circles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Erosion is a global problem, including in Wanagama. With the high risk of erosion, both naturally and due to high human activity, it is interesting and it is important to know how much erosion is in the Wanagama forest, especially in this study on kolonjono grasslands (Brachiaria mutica). The result of this study can be used as a base to avoid land degradation, while working together with the surrounding community needs to be maintained, which has recently become a trend in forest management in general to maintain the harmony of sustainable and sustainable forest management. However, the problem in measuring the erosion was faced when the rainfall happens rarely as a result of climate change. So, the development of erosion measurement tools is urgently required. The use of rainfall simulator was studied in order to find out that although during the dry season the erosion research can be carried out. The purpose of this study was to measure the erosion rate at the grass soil and after harvested soil, and to prove the use of rainfall simulator for measuring erosion. This study resulted that both the erosion and runoff have a positive correlation with the rainfall duration with the R square of 0.993 to 1. The erosion rate at the grass soil and at the post harvested soil were almost the same so there was no significant difference. However, the runoff at the grass soil was significantly different from the runoff at the post harvested soil. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Accelerating the development of new energy is an inevitable trend of the energy low-carbon transition. Information technology means and new energy and new energy business management are combined by most energy enterprises, so as to further improve the coordination of source, network and storage load in the development of new energy, solve the problem of new energy consumption, and improve the management efficiency. This study takes the "new energy cloud"platform of State Grid Corporation of China as the research object. Firstly, the basic architecture and operation mode of the cloud platform is analyzed; secondly, according to the characteristics of the operation mode, the evaluation index system of the "new energy cloud"operation mode is constructed from four dimensions of business, capital, learning and growth, and data. At the same time, the actual data of nine provinces that have deployed the "new energy cloud"platform are selected, and the weight of the evaluation index is determined by using the CRITIC - AHP method. This study can provide a model reference for related energy enterprises to build new energy business management platforms, and provide a practical reference for the evaluation of new energy business operation mode. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Amid rapid economic growth, the contradiction between water resources carrying capacity and distribution of productive forces have escalated, indicating the increasing barriers that water shortage and pollution have posed to sustainable development of the economy and society. China has currently entered an age of "new normal"in economic progress, during which constraints are imposed on resources and environment, ecological products become more indispensable, while infrastructure connectivity, and mechanism innovation appear more essential. Therefore, it remains important to dive into how to proactively implement the water management policy of the new era. The policy advocates overall planning and integrated management, requiring relevant agencies to comprehensively enhance the security of water availability and scientific management capabilities to resolve prominent problems of systematic management and coordination between the market and government under the premise of prioritizing water conservation and promoting spatial water balance. This paper conducted a preliminary analysis of problems about water resources allocation and dispatch management in some key areas of Yunnan Province and raised targeted suggestions including innovation in management mechanisms and approaches, and promotion of integrated management and scientific dispatch of water resources. The purpose is to provide some references for Yunnan about its integrated allocation and dispatch management of water resources in key areas and the network of major water supply projects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, with the improvement of the coefficient of merit of thermoelectric materials, the research of thermoelectric power generation has entered a new climax. The developed countries have listed the development of thermoelectric power generation technology into the medium and long-term energy development technology. The research on thermoelectric power generation in China started relatively late, mainly focusing on the theory and preparation of thermoelectric materials. At present, the field of semiconductor thermoelectric power generation is just introduced, and its practical application is still blank.

abstract={Waste management and environmental preservation are some of the hot topics the world is trying to address today. In the pursuit to achieve these goals, researchers and stakeholders all over the globe are researching and developing sustainable technologies. In the area of the construction industry, concrete is considered to be one of the most dynamic construction materials ever developed and utilized practically, and thus concrete is hugely utilized in construction practices all over the world. With the growing demand in infrastructure because of the increase in the global population, concrete would be needed to be produced in billions of tons. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is considered to be the main binder of concrete. It leads to approximately 8% of the global carbon dioxide emission contributed by human beings. Also, the production of concrete has led to a huge danger on natural deposits of raw materials. Thus, the growing demand for concrete and its sustainability-related issues have made it critical for researchers to consider other alternatives for concrete production, where OPC and aggregates can either be partially or fully replaced as the main binding material of concrete. One such highly anticipated alternative is green concrete. The paper highlights contemporary innovations amp; advancements in the field of green concrete by exploring the various advantages one can achieve by utilizing alternative binding materials such as alkali-activated binders, supplementary cementitious materials, and recycled materials like wastewater in concrete. The incorporation of these alternative and more sustainable materials into concrete not only helps us to achieve the aim of green buildings and environmental conservation, but research has shown that the incorporation of these alternatives also leads to the enhanced properties of concrete as compared to the conventional one. Even if we explore the economic aspects of utilizing these alternatives, the new binders are found to be having better results than the conventional ones. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Mbay City is a lowland city flanked by rows of mountains and agricultural rice fields. This barren mountain range causes rainwater mostly flow towards the urban lowlands, as flood. The city of Mbay which consists of 3 different regional groups, namely mountains-lowlands-rice fields, encourages a sustainable water supply and management with an eco-hydraulic concept. First, it is necessary to understand the terms eco-hydraulics, sustainable water management and sustainable water supply as well. Furthermore, we can find the right innovation to handle the three distinctive areas of the different Mbay cities. Mountain areas need water conservation that applies ecological concepts, while urban plains need hydraulic handling to drain flood water from the city, and rice fields also need ecological handling so that rice fields are protected from overflowing sea water when high tide occurs. Finally, it can be said that the integrated handling of ecology and hydraulics concepts has made the city of Mbay able to manage and supply water in a sustainable manner. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The current progress of information and communication technology has been critical to the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) in a aquaculture system. IoT solution in this system utilizes interconnectivity between devices to obtain fish pond monitoring data from sensing devices and then transmit the data to a remote server to be analyzed for decision-making in pond management. In this paper, we propose a smart pond IoT solution that provides a continuous and real-time pond monitoring. The system principally embeds five sensors that measure critical environmental parameters to determine water quality: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), and salinity. The IoT solution also integrates the development of a mobile application on the android platform that allows remote monitoring capabilities for users to maintain efficient pond management. The application is designed with a friendly-user interface that helps the farmer to monitor sensor measurements, manage fish production cycle, record fish feeding schedule, and also monitor the health status of fish from multiple ponds. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={China's urban sewage treatment developed rapidly, but there are many common problems. In the form of online questionnaire, 1100 people were randomly selected as sample data for description analysis. Based on quantitative research methods on China's drainage and sewage treatment from 1978 to 2019 and the literature research and information integration of related books and materials, this article discusses the commonalities in urban sewage discharge standards, sewage treatment, and effective sludge treatment and recycling. Descriptive research is carried out on the problem, and due to the current main contradiction in sewage treatment, it is converted to the effective removal of nitrogen and phosphorus organic matter. Then, anaerobic ammonia oxidation is introduced and its scientific and technological prospects are prospected, hoping to provide supportive reference for related research researchers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Circular Economy (CE) is increasingly used waste management concept especially in transition nations to transforms linear into a circular concept of waste production. CE sees waste as secondary raw material for re-production. Globally, CE has been studied and practiced in recent years. However, there are still few studies related to small islands. The characteristics of solid waste in small islands differ from the one on the Main Island, such as how solid wastes generated and the typology of solid waste. Karimunjawa Islands District is one of the small islands in Indonesia that has begun to experience environmental problems because of the excessive amount of solid waste. This study aims to identify the implementation of CE in small islands. This study was conducted by literature study, questionnaire, observation, interview with local stakeholders, and forum group discussion. The result revealed that there are leaks in macroeconomic aspects from manufacturing activities to consumption activities as well as market failures from consumption activities to waste disposal. It is indicated that waste management in small islands can be sustainable and independent after closing loops/leaks by procuring technology, setting clear regulations related to solid waste management, performing effective waste transportation, and holding house-to-house socialization regarding sustainable behavior. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the improvement of intelligent temperature control technology, the "three phases and nine stages"temperature control curve used in the casting of extra-high arch dams also needs to be adjusted according to project requirements. In Baihetan Hydropower Station, the design is 120 days to reach the arch sealing temperature, but in the actual construction sometimes need to shorten or extend the length of time through the water, resulting in the arch dam concrete stress changes, so that the arch dam temperature control anti-cracking increased the difficulty. In this paper, we designed 90 days and 150 days to reach the arch sealing temperature through simulation calculation, and compared it with the standard working conditions. The results found that: shortening or extending the arch sealing temperature by 30 days brings less stress changes to the arch dam concrete, and the arch dam as a whole is in a safe range, and the temperature control curve can be reasonably adjusted according to the actual needs of the project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of global climate change and urbanization in China, urban waterlogging caused by rainstorm has a serious impact on the safety of people's life and property and the development of social and economic. Based on the hydraulic model, taking Xining City as an example, a set of multi-layer flood prevention infrastructure construction technology system is proposed, in which the microscale-drainage-system mainly includes the sponge transformation of building blocks, the construction of sponge park; the mesoscale-drainage-system mainly includes the transformation of pipe system for different return periods, the transformation of combined flow and separate flow system; the macroscale-drainage-system mainly includes utility tunnel system, natural and artificial storage facilities. Through quantitative evaluation of rainstorm with 50 year return period, under the construction of microscale-drainage-system and mesoscale-drainage-system with different return period index, the total drainage capacity increased from 1.407 million m3 to 1.573 million m3 and 1.830 million m3. The total accumulated water is 1.073 million m3 and 0.816 million m3 respectively, which are less than 1.173 million m3 of macroscale-drainage-system new storage capacity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Technology is constantly growing, however, in the same way energy demand; over the years, different ways have been sought to better use of renewable resources in order to achieve better results in energy generation and supply that energy demand, but in turn to be feasible methods, an example of this is bifacial photovoltaic systems. This research carried out a Techno-Financial comparison between bifacial and monofacial systems for the locations of Naco, Cortés and Marcovia, Choluteca. In which the design of a bifacial photovoltaic installation was carried out assuming three types of land, being grass, soil and white gravel, with the purpose of analyzing the increase in albedo, and consequently the increase in energy production. Similarly, a monofacial system was designed for the same locations with the same capacity. The research made use of a quantitative methodology with a correlational focus, in which LCOE was established as the main research variable. In this way it was determined which photovoltaic system of those analyzed presents the lowest LCOE for both locations, of which it was made based on two assumptions, considering the value of the terrain and without considering it. Finally it was possible to determine that the lowest LCOE in a scenario where the value of the terrain is considered is obtained by the monofacial system for both localities, otherwise the scenario without considering the value of the terrain, the lowest LCOE presented by the bifacial system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Almost all sectors including agriculture have the risk of being affected by global climate change. It need strategies and prepare adaptation action programs with the support of innovative and adaptive technologies to anticipate. This research aimed to find out an appropriate dosage of organic fertilizer decomposted by biofilmed biofertilizer (OF-Bio2) that optimally increases mustard growth as well as N, P and K status at Lithosols. The experiment was done in a single factor randomized completely block design (RCBD) with eight dose levels, i.e. 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 ton ha-1 of OF-Bio2 on 2 x 3 m2 plot and 15 x 20 cm planting spaces. OF-Bio2 was incorporated thoroughly within 20 cm depth of the soil and one mustard plantlet was planted in each planting hole. Plant height, fresh and dry weights were observed and soil organic carbon (SOC), total-N, av-P and exch-K content were analysed at harvest time. Data were analysed by F-test followed by Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) at 95% of confidence level. The result showed the use of OF-Bio2 increased mustard growth linearly as well as N, P and K status concomitantly with the increase of OF-Bio2 doses. An optimal dose of OF-Bio2 for mustard yield was not achieved yet, because of low organic matter content of the soil. The use of biofilm biofertilizer to decompose organic fertilizer will support sustainable soil nutrient management with more effective soil microbes enable to increase nutrient available. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In order to further explore the complex correlation between the influencing factors of road traffic accidents in China, this paper takes the road traffic safety-related data of 31 provinces from 2004 to 2018 as the sample data, selects five index data that may affect the occurrence of traffic accidents in various regions of the country, i.e. resident population, urban population, population density, GDP and number of car drivers, and uses Eviews software for stepwise regression analysis to establish a fixed effect model of the influencing factors of traffic accidents and analyze the macro and micro factors that affect the death toll of traffic accidents in China. The model shows that each index has a significant impact on the number of road traffic casualties. Urban population, population density and number of car drivers are positively correlated with the number of road traffic casualties. The resident population and GDP are negatively correlated with the number of road traffic casualties. According to the research conclusions, this paper puts forward some suggestions, such as optimizing the management technology of road traffic construction, strengthening the education system of traffic safety awareness of residents in the new urbanization, increasing the investment in traffic construction, and establishing an institution for differentiated training and management of drivers based on driving experience. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Green roof and bioretention have been frequently used as stormwater management practices to address urban hydrology issues, and researches regarding these technologies are increasing lately. However, a knowledge gap remains in characterizing the hydraulic properties of these practices. The hydrological process of green roof and bioretention is mainly determined by the substrate media of the practices. Based on current studies, this paper discussed factors affecting the hydrological response of substrate material for green roofs and bioretention. Most researches provide qualitative information on water movement within substrate, but few have further investigated the theoretical explanations on the hydrological process of substrate and give quantitative data. This study proposed that following factors affecting water flow dynamics of substrate media: type of materials and composition of the materials; depth of the substrate media; pore structure/network of the substrate materials. Many investigations focus on the effect of a single factor and generalizing the other, but the hydrological process of the substrate material is mostly under the effect of multiple factors simultaneously. And under different study conditions and different designs of green roof or bioretention, the importance of these factors to the hydrological performance of substrate media is different. In addition, interrelationships exist among the factors, changes in one factor could influence other factors. Current research on the factors influencing the hydrological process of the substrate material needs to be related. Future study needs to consider the effect of multiple factors and their interrelations, to create integrated approaches for a better understanding of the hydrological process of the substrate material, and for modeling the hydrological performance of the green roof and bioretention more accurately and designing the practices more efficient. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={An assessment of innovative potential in the touristic-recreational sphere within the steppe regions in Russia is considered. Based on the author methodology (with selected indicators that the most complete reflect innovative potential), we marked out region - leaders, according to a level of innovative potential of the touristic-recreational sphere (the Republic of Crimea, Adygei, Sevastopol city) and outsiders (Volgogradskaya, Saratovskaya, Orenburgskaya oblasts). A final assessment of innovative potential is represented as a schematic map. A perspective plan "Innovative potential of the touristic-recreational sphere' development in the steppe regions"was developed to effective progress of the touristic sphere and based on the following principal aspects: use of new recreational resources; regular updating and identification of new market outlets of touristic products; use of new techniques and technologies in the course of the realization of touristic products; construction of the system of scientific and human resources in the tourism; organization of event activities connected with the tourism (touristic exhibition, fairs, etc.). The conducted study will introduce in practice an optimized management strategy of the touristic-recreational sphere development in Russia's steppe regions, taking into account the current challenges. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The goal of this paper is to evaluate some general trends of species range shifts in the steppe areas of the south-eastern West Siberian Plain. Two sets of distribution data of grasshoppers are compared: (1) for the first half of 20th century and (2) for 1972 - 2019. A series of digital maps was generated by Map Info. Shifts of species distribution patterns are discussed. All grasshopper species may be split into three groups: (1) acridids without evident changes in their distribution; (2) species with local range boundaries shifted northwards and northeastwards; new colonies of such forms are usually found in the northern steppe and even in the forest-steppe and/or on the right side of the Ob River; (3) grasshoppers which became rare. Among them is the Siberian grasshopper, the very common pest in the first half of the 20th century. Some changes into grasshopper distribution may be associated with global warming, but others can be explained by regional and local variations in human activities. Extension, intensification, and changes of human activities may result in continuous elimination of some local populations. This means that the general strategy of management of acridid assemblages and populations should incorporate both data and technologies concerning rare species populations and new approaches to pest control and monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of the study is to prove the need for development of innovative territorial clusters (ITC) in steppe regions. With a well-known determination of the factors of sustainable economic development of steppe regions of Russia, territorial planning and formation of environmental management structures were considered the most important. Today, the greatest relevance for steppe regions of Russia should be seen in development of the ITC as the most important condition for transition to a new technological order in the coming decades of the 21th century and a new management system based on improving scenario forecasting tools that allow identifying trends and incentives for sustainable economic development of steppe regions of Russia as a result of minimizing problems and strengthening their economic potential in the process of climate restructuring of the Earth. The results of the study include the following: definition of the ITC role as a tool for normalizing economic relations between research and educational organizations, business, development institutions and the state, as well as possibility of adapting the resulting cluster model of joint activity management to solving problems of sustainable economic development of steppe regions in the context of digital transformation of Russian economy. Innovative territorial approach should become the basis for Complex programs of ecological, economic and noospheric development of Russian regions. And there are all the prerequisites for this-rapid development of digital technologies, and along with it the growth and rapid promotion of digital innovations, without which there is no future, make this goal feasible and achievable. Therefore, it can be said that ITCs in steppe regions should serve as a source of digital innovations in Russian economy, creating new jobs for population, increasing viability of their territories and ensuring food security of the country as a whole. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm in the manufacturing world. It has radically changed the way people and machines interact. Main features of Fourth Industrial Revolution are the following: technological transformation, artificial intelligence and digitalization. The variability in innovation performance in circumpolar countries has led to the development of many theoretical concepts. These concepts include the role of public policy, research and development, foreign direct investment, human capital and financial development in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This study examines the macroeconomic performance of circumpolar countries in terms of technological innovation from 2012 to 2017. The results show that globalization, R&D, GDP, financial development and human capital are important factors behind technological innovation. The article provides a detailed analysis of Industry 4.0 technologies in circumpolar countries. The authors believe that it is important to compare the statistics in circumpolar countries with the general statistics of the countries - members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in the framework of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={An important part of the environmental degradation is caused by the discharge of untreated or mistreated wastewater. Since centralized treatment systems have proved to be inefficient, tackling the environmental issues requires a regional approach. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) mitigate environmental impacts and contribute to financial savings of other firms. However, the literature evaluating WWTPs' financial performance and economic sustainability does not abound. Thus, this paper analyses the economic sustainability of wastewater treatment companies in Portugal by NUTS II regions, in 2016-2019. Using firms' financial reports from SABI, results show that, by and large, firms in the Centre region display higher financial performances when compared to other regions. These results can be used to investigate whether firms in the central region are implementing the best practices regarding management and technology. Results can also foster enhancements in the governance of regulated utilities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The global climate change resulting in shifting patterns distribution of rain was influenced to growth and development of rice plant. The aims of this study were to guide the implementation of rice cultivation technology based on climate change, to change the mind set of farmers from the hereditary habits to better system according to the climate change model, and to formulate the adaptation strategy to climate change impact in the management of rice plant in Soppeng Regency. The study began in January to April 2017 at 8 (eight) sub-districts in Soppeng Regency, South Sulawesi Province. The study employed descriptive quantitative study with survey model. Eighty farmers were selected purposively as respondents who are assumed to be able to answer the aspects studied such as production variables, diffusion of innovation, climatic elements, and government policy. Data analysis was descriptive quantitative analyzing rainfall according to Schmidt-Ferguson, SWOT analysis, and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with expert choice program 11. The results of analysis with AHP method indicate that cultivation technology adaptation that can be applied to the rice planting management in Soppeng Regency was based on the sequence of priority scales. The component of the planting schedule has the highest weight of 18.8%, followed by the improvement of planting patterns 15.8%, the use of improved varieties 15.6%, water management 14.6%, 14.0% system improvement, 7.9% fertilization, pest control 7.7%, and harvesting component of 5.6%. Some alternative activities or programs on climate change adaptation strategy in rice cultivation are: (1) field school activities; (2) cultivation technical training; (3) participatory pest surveillance; (4) site-specific climate information procurement; (5) climate change socialization activities; (6) creation of experimental farm; (7) matching cultivation variety with climate condition; (8) diversification and crop rotation; (9) seed procurement; and (10) budgets of farmers' groups. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Upland farmers in semi-arid region of Timor Island have frequently facing low and uncertain food crops production and chronic forage shortage during long dry season limiting livestock (cattle) production. This study explores forage development, particularly Leucaena and the dynamics of upland farming management among farmer groups in West Timor - Indonesia. The study mostly use forage data of ACIAR and AIAT-ENT collaboration research on forage development, particularly Leucaena conducted in ENT. The data were mostly analysed descriptively. The study showed that adoption of forage legume innovation, particularly Leucaena by upland farmers have solved forage shortage problem during long dry season in semi-arid region of Timor Island, it allowed farmers to do cattle fattening/shortening fattening period and improving crops (maize) production. Drawing on information regarding traditional farming (mixed-cropping) practices for food crops production and traditional local agro-forestry (Mamar) for perennial crops production, the research suggested that incorporated forage tree legume of Leucaena into both traditional farming system can improve/sustain crops and cattle production as well as environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia is the world's largest coconut producer, where smallholder plantations play a significant role. Income-generating from coconut farming currently very low because there is no by-products processing. The integrated coconut industry is a strategy to produce processed products with added value by utilizing all product components. However, implementing a rural-based integrated coconut industry faced several constraints. This paper aims to analyze the constraints of increasing coconut added value and identify the integrated coconut industry's business model, followed by a support system analysis. The constraints faced include raw material, processing, human resource capacity, and support system. These constraints are not only related to technical problems but also managerial aspects. Therefore, the required approach must be system-based, where the development of a business model with its supporting system is a strategic step to overcome. Three business model patterns can be built, distinguished by business model structure, role sharing, and risk management. The development of a business model requires an innovation system that allows the transfer of knowledge and technology. It focuses on capacity building, technology transfer, market access, and financial support. The system will involve small-medium enterprises, local government, research institutes, coconut associations, and financial institutions. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={New superior varieties of rice have a very important role in improving rice productivity. In Jambi Province, the use of VUB in irrigation land has begun to be in demand by farmers and dominated by Inpari varieties. This activity aims to find out the appearance of several new superior varieties (VUB) of rice and rice productivity on irrigated rice fields. The assessment activity was conducted in Sri Agung Village, Batang Asam District, Tanjung Jabung Barat, Jambi Province from March to July 2019. New superior varieties of rice paddy planted consist of Inpari 12, Inpari 13, Inpari 30, Inpari 32, Inpari 33, Baroma, Inpari Nutri Zinc, and Ciherang on an area of 2 ha. This assessment is carried out through an integrated crop management approach (IPM) with technology components including new superior varieties, legowo jajar planting system, fertilization, disease pest control, harvesting, and post-harvest. The results showed that the highest production is found in the Inpari 30 variety which is 7.30 t/ha because it has more tillers, more grain content, fewer quantities of hollow grain and weighs 1000 seeds heavier than other Inpari varieties. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The latest IAARD's innovation for stepping up in the productivity of red chilies is called the Double Fold Production (Proliga). Before this program started to be transferred, it was necessary to determine the existing features of the red chili cultivation technology at the study site of the Proliga program. The purpose of this study was to analyze the existing cultivation technology performance, productivity, constraints and to analyze red chili farming, and to formulate a strategy to improve the cultivation technology innovation package. The research was carried out through a structured survey of red chili farmers in Bukit Village, Karo Regency from August 2017 to February 2018. The results of the study found that the productivity of red chili in Karo District was stagnant for a decade, namely 8.28 t/ha. Area per house-hold was 0.060.15 ha. The average B/C value =-0.13. This study concludes that the main strategy to achieve a jump in productivity (from 8.25 t/ha to > 16.5 t/ha) through the application of Proliga technology innovation in Karo District was the use of healthy seeds, site-specific fertilization and Bemisia border installation since the beginning of planting. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Chili farming in the highlands is facing the problem of decreasing land fertility due to the loss of soil top layer, high humidity and rainfall that causes more pests and disease. Therefore, soil conservation, pests and plant diseases controlling are the priority in management of chili farming and these efforts are practically in line with the goal of sustainable agricultural development. This study aims to analyze the sustainability status of chili farming in the Highlands of Pacet Sub district, Region of Cianjur, West Java Province. Method of sustainability assessment using multidimensional scaling approach with RAP-Chili technique that includes 34 attributes on dimension of environment, economic, social, technology, and institution. The results show that chili farming in highlands of Pacet was quite sustainable with an index about 54.39 percent. Out of five dimensions, environment and economic dimension had the highest index in moderately sustainable category while other dimensions were less sustainable. Thus, improvement toward sustainable chili farming could be prioritized on less sustainable dimension which were social, technology and institution by considering leverage attributes of those dimensions, namely extension program, application of bio pesticide and pest trap, post harvesting technology and availability of marketing institution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={High dependence on fishery resources in the small islands region in the Regency of Sitaro Islands is mostly caused by unemployment and unsupportive conditions of agricultural land. The pressure on fish resources and aquatic environment in that area becomes higher due to some fishing gears that could only be operated in that region, as well as the existence of local wisdom that limits fishing areas. This condition requires comprehensive management for sustainable fisheries activities. Conducted in the villages of Buhias, Matole, Pahepa, and Tapile, which are located in the small islands, Regency of Sitaro Island, this study aimed to determine the sustainability status of fisheries management based on dimensions of biophysical -technology, market, social, economic, institutional, ethical and infrastructure by using Rapfish Analysis. Sensitive attributes that affect the sustainability of fishery management on the dimension of biophysical - technology: fishing area border; market dimension: changing fish prices among seasons, dimension of socio-economic: the amount of income outside fisheries, dimension of institutional: role of women in the group, dimension of ethical: illegal fishing and dimension of infrastructure: transportation. Therefore, those attributes should get more attention in the sustainability of fishery management in the area of the small island. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Banten Bay is one of the demersal fishing locations which is widely used by the surrounding coastal communities. The purpose of this study is to analyze the vulnerability of demersal fisheries management in the Banten Bay area. The data used in this study were primary data and secondary data. Primary data was obtained from field observations, while secondary data were obtained through a desk study approach using references that supported the research. The research location was in Karangantu Port, Serang in October 2020. The vulnerability analysis approach was used to see the level of vulnerability of demersal fish utilization in Banten Bay. The results shown that the level of vulnerability in demersal fish can be divided into five dimensions, namely ecological, technology, social, economic, and institutional vulnerability. Social and institutional dimension has the high vulnerability value,0.74 and 0.72, respectively. While the lowest is in the technology dimension of 0.05. The ecological dimension has low vulnerability value, 0.39 and economic vulnerability values according to fisher's perceptions are 0.45, which are included in the medium vulnerability category. The average results from all dimensions shown that demersal fisheries in Karangantu are classified as low vulnerability level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the continuous development of exploration technology, the magnitude of seismic data is getting larger and larger, and the access efficiency of seismic data has become the main bottleneck in the process of seismic data processing. The cluster structure realizes the separation of computing and storage. The data is stored in the disk array, and the data is calculated in the computing node. The maximum network speed between each computing node and the management node is 1GB/s, and the total maximum network speed of all computing nodes is 5GB/S (peak value). In addition, for disk array, the maximum read speed can be ignored (more than 1GB/s) without considering the network bandwidth, while the maximum write speed is 350MB/s. In the process of data processing, it needs to flow between the disk array and the computing node, and its speed must be affected by the network bandwidth. Therefore, the theoretical maximum I/O speed of the system is 1GB/s for reading and 350MB/s for writing. To build a multi format seismic data model, the loading of the system before optimization can not support the original seismic data format, so the original seismic data (such as SEGY and SEGD) needs to be converted into the internal ATT format of the system. In this process, the whole original data needs to be read circularly, and the new file is written circularly, and then the new file is decompiled, Save the header part into the table in the database. Export is the opposite process, which needs to convert ATT format to SEGY or SEGD format. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In the pilot project of reclamation and utilization of historical abandoned industrial and mining lands in Shenmu City, management requirements such as total control of resource utilization, two-way regulation of supply and demand and difference are implemented to standardize the reclamation and utilization behavior of abandoned industrial and mining lands. The waste residue covered by the mining area shall be stripped and cleared, the buildings and structures in the mining area shall be dismantled, and all the waste residue and construction waste shall be transported to the designated accumulation point. Then, as needed, it will be cleared into farmland, forests, grasslands and rivers. Results: The reclamation area of the project covers 42 plots, with a total area of 2146.4 mu. The construction scale of the project is 124.8122hm2. Through the reclamation of abandoned industrial and mining land, 22.1038hm2 of new cultivated land was added in the project area, with a rate of 17.71%. The new grassland area was 32.2119hm2. After reclamation, the land utilization rate of the project increased significantly, reaching 93.38%. It promotes the balance of dynamic indexes of cultivated land in Shenmu City, maintains the dynamic balance of total cultivated land in Shaanxi Province, and improves the production and living conditions of local farmers. The project has great ecological benefit, obvious social benefit and certain economic benefit. The unification of social benefit, economic benefit and ecological benefit is realized, which accords with the goal of industrial waste land reclamation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={As a DC system, the performance and stability of battery play a vital role in the hydraulic, electric and telecommunication industries. In the process of charging and discharging, some batteries in the battery pack will be damaged in advance due to the voltage inconsistency among battery cells, and the service life will be greatly shortened. Therefore, it is necessary to charge the battery evenly to solve the above problems, prolong the service life of the battery and further improve the reliability of the battery. The equalization technology proposed in this paper adopts the double closed-loop control mode of gap-type priority charging, adopts the optical MOS switch array inside, and uses the switching power supply technology to transfer the power of high-voltage batteries to low-voltage batteries by means of energy transfer. Electricity transfer is bidirectional and parallel, so as to achieve battery voltage balance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This work is devoted to the formation of a rational energy balance in Russia and its pragmatic management of alternative energy during the climate crisis using information technologies. The aim of the work is to study low-carbon development aimed at reducing the amount of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, to stabilize climate change and prevent negative consequences. A comparative analysis of several countries has shown that renewable energy influences both the situation in the global energy market and the environmental situation of the country as a whole. The territorial study of sunshine in Russia has identified the regions where the transition to alternative energy sources for further energy supply is the most effective, and is able to ensure financial sustainability and tariff equalization, as well as an increase in the living standards of the population. Based on the results of the work done, the root causes of the lack of active implementation of renewable energy sources were identified and a profitable direction for the development of an alternative energy system for Russia was formed. The article is supplied with graphic materials and tables, as well as a detailed description of each stage of the study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study aims to determine the surface area and adsorption power of the chitosan membrane against Pb (II) metal ions in the Tallo river basin and determine the optimization of Pb (II) ion absorption by chitosan membrane adsorbents and the adsorption time of the chitosan membrane against Pb (II) metal ion in Tallo river basin. The method used in this study consisted of chitosan synthesis from crab shell waste, chitosan membrane design with various membrane variations comprised of a concentration ratio of chitosan and cellulose acetate respectively 35%, 65%, 45%: 55%, 50 %: 50% and 65%: 35% with variations in adsorption time of 10; 25; 45; 60 minutes, then followed by the adsorption mechanism of the chitosan membrane against Pb (II) metal ions. Determination of the surface area was carried out using the Brunner Emmer Teller (BET) analysis. In contrast, the optimization of Pb (II) ion absorption and adsorption power was carried out using UV Vis spectrophotometry. The results showed that the surface area of the chitosan membrane reached 765 m3 / g, a pore volume of 1,267 cc / g, and a pore diameter of 4.7 nm, the adsorption capacity of the chitosan membrane against Pb (II) metal ions was 76.34%. In comparison, the adsorption capacity of the chitosan membrane against ions Pb (II) metal was 68.5 mg / g for 100 minutes. This study recommends the use of a chitosan membrane to reduce the levels of Pb (II) metal ions and improve the quality of Tallo river water for consumption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The energy requirement level in Indonesia is quite high. The increasing oil and gas upstream industries to fulfil energy requirement in the future is highly connected with the escalation of wastes, especially drilling wastes. Drilling is one of the main operations in upstream oil and gas industries, which can harm the environment with its various types of wastes. The drilling process produces millions of barrels of wastes each year. However, with the industries being rapidly developed to fulfil national energy requirement, environmental-related regulations for drilling activities have been firmly tightened. Drilling and drilling mud system technology is more sophisticated and the majority of oil drilling companies are starting to adopt environmentally friendly drilling options. The objective of writing this article is to acknowledge the method of drilling waste processing by considering environmentally friendly aspect. Drill Cutting Re-Injection (DCRI) is one of the developing environmentally friendly processing techniques with zero discharge in oil and gas industries. With the utilization of the DCRI process, the companies can produce positive outcomes such as low environmental impact, low safety risks, low transportation problems, and economically cleaning responsibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, climate change has made the public more concerned about greenhouse gas emissions, and the burning of agricultural waste has been proven to be one of the non-negligible sources of CO2 emissions leading to global warming. Taiwan is a relatively scarce region with limited land and insufficient landfills to dispose of waste. It provides an opportunity for Taiwan to develop circular agriculture. This study takes the elderly in the Xinxing Community in Dacun Township, Changhua County, Taiwan, as the research object. Using qualitative interviews and quantitative analysis methods, we can more fully and accurately grasp the awareness of the elderly in the Xinxing Community on agricultural waste. The study results show that there is no significant difference in the cognition of agricultural waste treatment among senior citizens in emerging communities whether they are engaged in the grape industry or not. However, there are significant differences in the cognition of agricultural waste resource treatment technology. The cognition of being engaged in the grape industry is higher than that of those who are not engaged in it, and they have a higher cognition of agricultural waste resource treatment technology. In addition, there is no significant difference in the perception of agricultural waste resource reuse operations. This research provides suggestions for the future development of sustainable environments and the management of emerging communities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Solid waste accumulation is increasing each year rapidly and composes a crucial threatens to a healthy life, and exhausts natural resources. Major steps must be taken to initiate a new human manner and habits to reduce, recycle, and reuse waste as a part of sustainable development. This research discusses the activity initiate at the Chemical Engineering Department - University of Technology - Baghdad /Iraq to engage faculty members and students at solid waste management's approaches through adopt classification and sorting of the solid waste at the source. The second stage was to analyze the amounts and types of accumulated solid waste at the chemical engineering department building for one semester starting from 1st February to 30th June. In the same year, the waste examination was recorded each week. The final stage was a questionnaire to some participants (faculty, staff, and students) to investigate staff reluctance to be involved actively in solid waste sorting and motivate more university staff to participate in waste sorting at the source. The results show that the separated solid waste material represented only 35% of the department's total generated waste through the research period. The total weight of the characterized waste was 448 Kg. Waste paper is the largest percentage of waste with a total weight (155.5 kg), followed by organic (110 kg), plastic (100 kg) and metal (82.5 kg). This research encouraged students to engage in reuse / recycle programs. They formed groups. The first group produced fuel oil from waste plastic by pyrolysis. The second student's group converted waste paper to card paper. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study aims to analyze and implement methods for storing electrical energy directly or indirectly in the Iraq National Grid to avoid electricity shortage. Renewable energy sources are changing with time and climatology conditions. Therefore, the impact of weather on power generated and demand using renewable energy is considerable. This issue becomes a new motivation for developing new energy storage systems independent of time and weather. Stored energy ensures the smooth and clean transmission of electricity in conditions where the delivery may be interrupted or mismatched. Storage energy technologies are intelligent as they diversify energy sources, develop economic growth and produce more jobs. Technologies like Redox Flow Batteries (RFB), Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and other forms were analyzed within this study. The PHS mechanical indirect electrical energy storage system is a great way to store large amounts of off-peak energy; however, it faces geographical challenges when siting such a development. The paper has strongly recommended the PHS to be used in Iraq due to the unique characteristics of 20,000 cycles, 33 year lifespan, and 80% round trip efficiency. Although Iraq has two rivers, salinity and water management must take into consideration. The study also suggested that RFB and CAES can be added to the network. The future work will concentrate on employing biomass technology, protection and improving the life span of these technologies. Solar and Wind technologies are excluded, as many research papers are available online. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has gained great attention in construction management because it provides a significant benefit such as increasing project quality, providing accurate quantity take-offs, and improving scheduling, consequently diminishing total project contingencies and costs. There is a lack of research done for ether BIM application or sustainability in the construction industry in Iraq. Therefore, the goal of this research is to investigate the use of BIM applications for sustainable construction among designers and constructors in Iraq. An online survey was developed to determine the evidence for better understanding the current role of BIM by engineers and professionals as a tool in the fields of design and construction and its application toward enhancing sustainably built projects in the construction industry in Iraq. The survey results indicated that although the majority of the respondents believed that sustainable practices and BIM applications were important within their company, most still believed that the Iraqi construction firms did not apply the most recent technologies to enhance sustainability in construction in Iraq. Also, the result indicated that respondent firms were actively advised owners to apply sustainable methods during projects, however these firms were not willing to fund training courses on advanced sustainable practice developments for their staff. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The growth in population leads to significantly increasing the water demand. Thus, the disparity between demand and supply for water has become an important problem in human life. One of the most effective solutions to overcome this disparity is to manage urban water. Greywater, a significant part of domestic wastewater or sewage, can play an essential role in the urban environment. To address this role, the current paper aims to provide families with some efficient, affordable and sustainable systems to treat greywater. For non-drinking services, treated greywater may be used in various applications such as irrigation, toilet-flushing, car-washing, etc. Around the world, there are several types of greywater treatment systems. A study of these processes has been undertaken to assess the most appropriate activities at the family and community level. The best techniques for treating greywater in this study, constructions wetland (C.W.) instead of other techniques, as this is a sustainable, low-cost and easy-to-apply technology. The use of grey water is important because it decreases the demand for fresh water and decreases treatment stress. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Green buildings have made a significant contribution to low-carbon and energy-saving. However, green construction projects will face greater risks than traditional construction projects due to their high cost and complex technology. Having important information or knowledge can help the project organization to stifle the risk at the source. This paper intends to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge transfer by studying the risk assessment in the process of knowledge transfer between project organizations, thereby helping to reduce the risk of green building projects. This paper first explores the influencing factors of knowledge transfer and the interrelationship between the influencing factors by analyzing the existing literature; then uses ISM method and the MICMAC analysis method, to sort out the order and hierarchy of the influencing factors in knowledge transfer, and analyze at the same time their forces of driving and dependences. Then author proposes countermeasures to the risk of knowledge transfer between project organizations. The results show that the two types of risks, low network connection strength and lack of transfer mechanisms, have a greater impact on knowledge transfer, but they are easy to manage.

abstract={Energy conservation and emission reduction is an important part of enterprise management. Energy costs directly affect the economic benefits of enterprises. Energy control of industrial air conditioning has long been the focus of the attention of enterprises. At present, enterprises often adopt fixed pre-cooling and pre-heating time for air conditioning start-up strategy, and there is no unified and scientific standard. By collecting and cleaning the historical data (climate, capacity) of air conditioning operation of enterprises, this paper establishes a scientific model of air conditioning energy consumption and a prediction model of air conditioning starting time. In addition, the theory and technology proposed in this paper are applied in practice to design and implement the air-conditioning energy control system of smart factory, and to predict the starting time of the air-conditioning in the production workshop of enterprises. The results show that the system can help enterprises achieve the goal of intelligent energy management and control. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Comparing to wastewater management practices, various treatment options available for Faecal Sludge (FS) are almost a century old. 2.7 billion People across the globe, mainly in the developing nations are relying on "On Site Sanitation Systems", OSS or unsewered sanitation. This situation will last for decades as city wide sanitation through sewer lines is neither feasible nor affordable. It is estimated that by the year 2030, almost five billion people across the globe would be relying on OSS. This paper focuses on issues of FS in developing nations, the huge gaps in sanitation value chain, the technological options available and innovations in treating FS through "Omni Processor". With ultimate aim of removing pathogens and converting FS into water and electricity it works on various technological options that are not limited to super critical oxidation, pyrolysis, combustion and so on. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) is the proposed new international agreement on the sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. It will be an international, legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The road to the development of a new international agreement has been started. The issue of BBNJ has been discussed for the past 15 years since the adoption of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution A/Res/59/24 on November 17, 2004. This paper addresses the issue of the development of BBNJ from the Indonesian perspective as an Archipelagic State. Analysis of available publications related to all activities' legal standing in the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) is conducted in this paper. The article starts with definitions and the legal standing of BBNJ. This paper specifically elaborates the package deal components as the basis for drafting an international legally binding instrument (ILBI). The package deal comprises marine genetic resources and access to benefits sharing, area-based management tools, including marine protected areas, environmental impact assessment, capacity-building, and marine technology transfer. The paper will then elaborate on the policy implication of BBNJ for Indonesia, including the adverse and its benefits. Finally, the article concludes with Indonesia's recommendations to anticipate the entry into force of the new agreement of BBNJ. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

funding_text 1={It is believed that many research institutions from developed countries that are willing to cooperate with Indonesia in the marine research sector. Experience so far has shown that Indonesian researchers have collaborated with many marine research institutions in the world. Recently, the Research Centre for Oceanography - LIPI conducted a joint expedition with a research institute of Singapore, with a focus on marine biodiversity research in Southern Java (Indian Ocean). The expedition with the title of the South Java Deep-sea Biodiversity Expedition 2018 was carried out by scientists from Indonesia, Singapore, and France. The expedition is non-commercial research, with a focus on marine biodiversity research in deep-sea waters. This expedition was fully financed by Singapore. Some of the benefits obtained from this joint expedition include the knowledge of marine biodiversity in South Java, Indian Ocean; increasing the capacity of Indonesian researchers in conducting field surveys in deep-sea waters and laboratory analysis; and a number of scientific publications [49] [50]. Through this way, it is also expected that the issue of the establishment of multi-purpose MPA in ABNJ whether in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean might be realized.},

abstract={Technology is growing fast and as a result of this, the performance of electronic devices is rapidly increasing. These devices generate heat as current flow through them and this heat energy has to be safely managed and dissipated which is achieved with the help of a heat sink. Amongst the heat sink materials, graphene reinforced metal matrix composite is emerging as an alternative promising high thermally conducting material and an effective material for proper heat management. In the current work, Metal matrix composites based on pure aluminium reinforced with graphene powder are fabricated using stir casting method. Thermal and mechanical characteristics studies were performed on the stir cast composite specimen. Certain parameters like argon for stirring, processing temperature (820°C), stirring time (5-10 sec) and graphene content (10 volume% of pure aluminium added) were considered for the experiment. The enhancement in heat conduction of the test samples were confirmed by the wear testing method. High rate of heat conduction and comparatively low wear rate were observed in aluminium-graphene composite rather than pure aluminium as received sample. The test samples were analysed using optical microscope, SEM and EDS. Thus, this paper present insight in to the fabrication of Aluminium-graphene composite by stir casting method. In addition, thermal and mechanical characterizations of the fabricated samples are also examined. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia's energy consumption is still increasing, including in the West Kalimantan Region, by 8.2% growth in electricity customers. During this time, West Kalimantan still fulfilling its energy needs in imports around 30% of energy supply (200 MW) from Sarawak, Malaysia. This condition can weaken national energy security and national sovereignty because it has not independently met its energy needs from domestic sources. At the same time, the potential for local energy sources in West Kalimantan is to get uranium deposits of 45,730 tons, which are nuclear fuel. Qualitative Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) research method to find the concept of self-management based on 4A (Availability, Affordability, Acceptability, Accessibility) + 1S (Sustainability). The results of the self-management concept obtained by integrating aspects: (1) Accessibility and Acceptability in the form of priorities for improving top-down and bottom-up cross-sectoral coordination management systems, namely the central and regional governments in the development of nuclear power plants with the involvement of local communities from the beginning of planning; (2) Affordability of making technical designs by BATAN with SMR (Small Modular Reactor) technology in the construction of commercial-scale nuclear power plants in terms of the availability of local resources as nuclear raw materials. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper constructs a game model between the government and power battery manufacturers with the aim of promoting the innovation of recycling technology to achieve sustainable development of energy and environment. The effects of penalties and subsidies on the behavior of power battery manufacturers in adopting green innovation technology strategies under unilateral and bilateral government policies are compared. Numerical simulations are used to verify the validity of the model and conclude that: penalties and subsidies can change the final choice of power battery manufacturers only when a certain threshold is exceeded; penalties can make power battery manufacturers adopt green innovation technology strategies more steadily than subsidies at an earlier stage when the green innovation technology surplus is negative; the number of recycling and the degree of technological innovation are also important factors affecting the evolutionary process of power battery manufacturers. Meanwhile, the above conclusions can provide some suggestions for the government to effectively manage the recycling of waste power batteries. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

It is noted that Indonesia has been the leading crude palm oil (CPO) producers since Year 2006 in the word. However, the sustainability of that business raising to be a questionable for it face slow replanting process particularly those which belongs to smallholder farmer. This study was conducted to analyse the effect of oil palm management on oil palm smallholder welfare in Jambi province. The study showed that the farming practice carried out by farmers, farmer perceptions of innovation, and work ethic have positive and significant effect on smallholder household welfare, while farmers attitudes towards RSPO and farmers' perceptions of replanting are tended to have a negative correlation on smallholder household welfare. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Advanced technology has entered the agricultural sector in an effort to streamline the agricultural production. Mechanization, one of advanced technology has contribution to increase productivity and resource's efficiency in agriculture. However, there is a need government's intervention to accelerate it. One of mechanization program by government is Agricultural Machinery Services Business (UPJA) which applied in farmer group level in Indonesia. The study aims to know the financial and work performance of UPJA in Tojo Una-Una Central Sulawesi especially for four wheel tractor with 85 House Power (HP) and 95 House Power (HP). The data were collected purposively from the UPJA program receiver and related stakeholder. Financial and work performance analyses were used to value the UPJA performance. The results show that UPJA business in farmer group level for both 85 HP and 95 HP tractor power were economically feasible with RC ratio of 1.27 and 1.15 consecutively. Tractor 95 House Power (HP) was more efficient compared to 85 House Power in land efficiency management with values 62% and 54%. The theoretical field capacity (Kt) tractor 85 HP was the same with tractor 95 HP about 0.403 ha/hour, while the effective field capacity (Ke) of tractor 95 HP was higher compared to 85 HP. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The appropriate concept of land use planning is required since the lands have the opportunity to be developed for agricultural purposes. Gunung Mas regency with total areas of 1,084,012 hectares is mainly covered by forest with various slope classes. The objective of study was to allocate the lands to be utilized based on its capabilities and suitability for food and plantation crops. Land evaluation approach was implemented to provide appropriate land use planning especially for food crop farming and plantation. Hierarchically, procedure of land capability evaluation (LCE) was used to classify lands based on their capability to produce common cultivated crops without deteriorating over a long period of time. Therefore, the proper land use for cultivation was further analysis using land suitability evaluation (LSE) procedure to determine fitness of a given type of land for a specific crop. The application of GIS and remote sensing technology were then used to generate additional spatial data as basic planning analysis. The results showed that agricultural system was located and implemented appropriately at arable lands. The use of LCE and LSE procedure can then be implemented to promote proper land use on sustained basis as important part of agroecological management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Environmental problems that occur are increasing every year, both water and air pollution. Not only human activities in the household but also due to industrial activities. One of them is in the plantation sector. Poor management of waste in the plantation industry causes environmental pollution. People who live around the plantation area are very disadvantaged. So, in this case, criminal law gives sanctions to the plantation industry corporation for deterrent effects. The problem in this study is criminal penalties against plantation companies do environmental pollution. The research method used in this study is normative juridical. This research is descriptive-Analytical, which is expected to obtain a detailed and systematic description to answer the problem. The results of the study show that the sanctions given to the perpetrators of criminal acts of environmental pollution must be in the form of strict law enforcement. So that criminal law becomes the foremost law in expressing legal issues. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={One of the government's efforts to protect productive agricultural land is by regulating Land Use Conversion Permit (LUCP). This permit must be obtained by every citizen wanting to convert agricultural land into non-Agricultural land. This study aims at analysing the role of the notary in obtaining LUCP to convert agricultural land into a residential area and its relation to the sustainability of food agricultural lands in Indonesia. This research uses a normative juridical approach. The results show that applying permission to convert agricultural land to non-Agricultural land is submitted to the Office of the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency (AASP/NLA). The role of a Notary and Land Deed Officer in converting agricultural land to non-Agricultural land, as stipulated in the Notary Law, is to provide guidance or counselling on legal matters to any individual in any condition. So, LUCP concerning the conversion of agricultural land is one of the government's efforts to protect sustainable food agricultural lands. Notaries/LDOs should continuously provide counselling regarding the importance of land use management by complying with the laws and regulations to maintain, control, and protect agricultural land so that the conversion of agricultural land to non-Agricultural land can be minimized. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia is an agricultural country with an abundant natural wealth of agricultural products. Moreover, it stays in a strategic geographical position, located in the tropical climate, and having high rainfall. Competent agricultural enterprise management can help in adapting to the ever-changing human needs. It can also maintain and even improve the quality of the environment. To maximize natural resource management, land management is a necessity. Land management is affected by several factors, namely society and its activities such as factory operations and activities. As society continues to develop, many lands have been misused. One of them is the conversion of agricultural lands into residential or infrastructural lands. The problem in this study is the management of agricultural land to support sustainable agriculture in North Sumatra. This research uses a normative juridical method through literature studies of laws and regulations on agriculture and spatial planning. The results show that the existence of unproductive agricultural lands and paddy land conversion to residential dwelling can be detrimental to farmers. In conclusion, agricultural land governance is needed to support sustainable agriculture in North Sumatra. The research suggests a need for regulations regarding the management of agricultural land in North Sumatra to realize sustainable agriculture. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Chilli supply chain is very vulnerable to risk due to scattered production centre, large number of actors along supply chain. Hence, risk management of chilli supply chain is very crucial to be executed in order to reduce the losses received by farmers and traders. The study aims to (i) identify and assess supply chain risks, and (2) arrange efforts to manage risks in the chilli supply chain. Weighted Failure Mode Effect Analysis (WFMEA) enriched by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was implemented to evaluate high-risk priorities and to manage those risks. The results showed that risk in marketing chain got the highest priority to be controlled since the greatest potential failure occurred in this channel with the weighted Risk Priority Number about 647.3. Risk indicators in this channel were cashless payment, major harvesting, and price fluctuations. Strategies to manage those risks were the provision of storage warehouses, planting time arrangements, bailout funds for cash purchase, harvest and post-harvest technology and farm capital loan. Government supports was required for providing the small-scale storage, home scale ozonation technology to extent the chilli shelf life and improve the product quality as well as policies on accessible farmer's credit with farming guarantee system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study was conducted in South Tapanuli District, which is one of the two oil palm centres implementing the landscape management project. Data collected from Regional Plan documents and 169 smallholder samples and analysed with Cross Tabulation and Compare Means Test. The results show that landscape management has been implemented through Regional Planning and various regulations. However, many institutions are authorized to manage landscape, which occasionally result in confusing and contradictory decisions. Through regulations, the Government has limited the expansion of oil palm plantations by specifying Forest and Food Regions. Intensification and diversification approaches are also considered as alternatives for balancing land allocations among sectors and commodities. Intensification is taught through the Sustainable Oil Palm Field School Program, which can improve smallholder knowledge and implementation of landscape management. However, smallholders with larger plantation areas are less interested in participating in the program. Diversifications were indicated through the smallholder cropping system, which is focused on potential commodities such as rubber, coffee or cacao. Smallholders perceive other commodities as less profitable because most of their agribusiness systems are less developed than the palm oil agribusiness system. Therefore, improvement in every potential agribusiness system is recommended to optimize landscape management in South Tapanuli. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In fact, this could lead to uncertainties for oil palm smallholders in Muara Batang Toru requiring several years to process replanting funds as there is no clear information regarding their area status. Initially, their areas were established as the irrigated paddy field region. However, the designation has changed to plantation region yet the information has not been well socialized among extension workers and statistic staffs that directly interact with smallholders. Oil palm smallholdings are developed from various lands of origin. In Districts Muara Batang Toru, smallholdings were initially opened and designed as paddy field through the transmigration program in 1986. A few years later, several paddy fields have changed into dry land and cultivated with horticultural crops such as beans and lemonades. In 1995, irrigation was built, supporting the development of both paddy fields and horticultural farming. However, horticultural diseases increased and income from paddy production is not enough to support the household expenditures of farmers. Therefore, farmers started to plant oil palm which contracted less diseases, requires less intensive work and provides more financial support from the mills.},

A study of SA was conducted in Manikin Watershed (MW) of West Timor during 2017 to 2019 in oder to understand the nature of SA using Agro-ecosystems approach and to analyse the strengths of SA for sustainable upland farming management. The research applied survey method in data collection. Qualitative data analysed using thematic analysis descriptively and mapping spacial analysis using open access of SAGAGIS. The results showed that Agro-ecosystem characteristics of SA at MW have characterised by Low Productivity, Low Stability, High Equitability, High Adaptability, and High Autonomous. High adaptability and some important components which are suits with resource poor farmers becomes the main reasons why upland farmers keep practicing SA. The strengths of SA lies on the farmers' perception that SA as an adaptive and suitable system of semi-Arid upland farmers' circumstances: saving labour, only need simple equipments, easy to applied, no external inputs used, fertilize the soil/crops, and harvest guarantee for at least one food crop. The SA have strengths to be improved and developed as a productive and sustainable farming model that suitable for semi-Arid upland communities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia is known as an agricultural country for its abundant natural wealth. It has a very strategic geographical position, located in the tropics and having high rainfall. The banking sector has a vital role in economic development. Even though bank business activities do not have a direct impact on the environment, banks can protect the environment through credit financing management. The problem observed in this study is the role of agricultural credit financing in realizing green banking in Indonesia. This research uses a normative juridical method supported by a literature review. The results show that the agricultural sector is directly in contact with society and has the potential to damage the environment. The protection from the banking sector is greatly needed to conserve the environment. Any form of potential environmental damage can be prevented through a special clause in the credit agreement. In conclusion, banks have a significant contribution to realizing the environmental sustainability of agricultural activities in Indonesia. At present, green banking in credit agreements has not included a clause regarding environmental management. This research suggests the banks to include a clause on environmental protection in credit agreements in accordance with the concept of green banking. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The concept of sustainable development comes from the environmental sectors. It covered by sustainable development include the agricultural and fishery sector. The sustainable fishery is a collection of activities that provide long-Term production sustainability, maintain the balance of ecosystems through generations, and preserve biological, social, and economic systems. However, irresponsible fishing activities such as illegal fishing greatly disrupt the development of sustainable fishery. Besides that, Indonesia has vast amount of potential agricultural land, specifically 100.7 million hectares consisting of 24.5 million hectares suitable for wetlands (rice fields). Having a tropical climate, it is possible to conduct agricultural activities throughout the year. This study aims at analysing illegal fishing as threat to sustainable fishery development and observing land usage systems in integrated agricultural activities. This research utilizes a legal method with a normative juridical approach. Data was collected through a literature review and analysed qualitatively. The results suggest three elements in implementing sustainable agricultural and fishery development, namely economic, ecological, and social elements. Illegal fishing and sustainable agricultural development both affect the attainment of these elements. As a recommendation, implementing sustainable fisheries and agriculture management system which includes efforts to minimize illegal fishing and increase world food barns are very necessary. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia is an agricultural country with abundant natural resources. Indonesia has enormous potential for plantation development to realize people's welfare. Especially in Langkat District as the third largest plantation area in North Sumatera. Seventy percent of Langkat District consists of oil palm plantations. Therefore, the management of plantations must have the principles of sovereignty, sustainability, efficiency. The operation of plantations is in line with the mandate and spirit of Article 33 paragraph (3) of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia that states that the land, water, and natural resources contained therein are controlled by the state and utilized maximally. To protect plantations from harvest thieves, the government issued Law Number 39 of 2014 concerning the Plantation Law. This research method is normative juridical. The results showed that with the enactment of Law Number 39 of 2014 concerning Plantation, there is no criminal sanction if it does not include the value of losses and the applicable law. To protect community oil palm plantations, the criminal justice system must establish criminal policies that support justice and benefit. In conclusion, as a system demands the Criminal Court to carry out criminal policies that prioritize legal objectives. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The effect of forest degradation had been apparent increasing disaster level risk, including land fire and forests. The real impact of land fire and forests, particularly in Labuhanbatu District, North Sumatera Province, was physical, socio-economic, and environmental losses that had the potential to cause further disasters. The research objective was to determine the vulnerability grade from forest level and fire lands in Labuhanbatu District, North Sumatera Province. The determination of vulnerability level model of land fire and forests used spatial modelling with the Composite Mapping Analysis method. The dependent variable of this model was the fire hotspot density. The driving factor for land fire and forests from the model of vulnerability for land fires and forest was the accessibility of the community, which was the distance from the road with a weighting of 63% in determining the fire vulnerability level. About 20% of Labuhanbatu District, North Sumatera Province, was in the high-very high vulnerability levels. Areas that had high-very high vulnerability levels were quite wide, including Aek Natas, Kualuh Hulu, and Na IX-X Districts. These areas were generally on a hilly-steep slope. The government and the community needed to improve monitoring and evaluation on lands. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A sustainable oil palm plantation strives to generate great profits without neglecting its surrounding community and environment. This paper discusses the standard production management at Plantation SOEs based on the concept of sustainable development of oil palm plantations. In improving quality and profits, companies require good faith to prevent fraud. The management of Plantation SOEs avoid an action that causes company losses, be attentive, avoid conflicts of interest, and take preventative actions. This is a normative juridical research showing that fraudulent practices such as the delivering palm oil commodities without official documents, false records, double invoicing, theft, embezzlement, corruption, loss of assets, deterioration of company health and income, and debt can threaten the reputation and cause losses for Plantation SOEs and the country. In conclusion, a sustainable oil palm plantation as a form of standardized production management at Plantation SOEs based on good faith is the main approach to prevent fraud and corporate and state losses. However, Management is not yet committed to implement this approach. To realize this, the good faith must be regulated according to the law, articles of association, and SOP. This will enable violators to be subjected to legal sanctions to protect public interests. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Oil palm plantations have significant revenue for Indonesia where most of the palm plantation are State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Good Corporate Governance (GCG) principle in plantation business management is sought to create added value for stakeholders, especially for the environment. The problem discussed in this paper is how corporate governance achieves sustainable plantation. This is normative juridical research supported by a literature review. The results show that palm plantation management cannot be separated from the situation and responsibility to the environment. The application of GCG principles as a guideline in management of SOE plantation has been regulated to create a sustainable business. Furthermore, in balancing the influence of business, the social and environmental responsibilities, there is a management regulation concerning its roles for the community which is known as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Ideally, plantation companies should not only reach the maximum profit in exploiting and marketing natural resources. They should also consider the best interests of society and the environmental impact of their business activities. In conclusion, Plantation SOEs must strive to minimize the impact on the environment. The internalization of GCG in environmentally oriented plantation SOEs creates sustainable plantation businesses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Domestic waste which has a high protein content has the potential to be bio-converted using Hermetia illucens larvae which has 45-50% protein nutrition and 24-30% fat. So that it can be used as a source of high nutritious feed for fish, chickens and other livestock. This research studied H. illucens larvae, known as Black Soldier Fly (BSF) through the SiMalin process, USU's Waste Management System through Urban Farming. The first step as an axus study is done by collecting garbage (vegetables and fruits) in each household in USU's housing. by varying the feed rate of 150, 200, 250 mg / larva / day. The study was conducted for 21 day by analysing larvae weight, consuming the substrate and trying to feed fresh wet larvae to fish and chickens. The results of this study indicate that the waste is the most optimal way to produce larvae in this process is a mixture of fruit peels with a feed rate of 250 mg/larva/day or a total weight of 25.00 grams per feeding. BSF is an alternative to utilizing waste that is appropriate and environmentally friendly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

It is of great significance to the stability and safety of hydropower projects. Based on the construction process requirements of the steel pipe in the tunnel of a water conservancy project in South China, this paper has developed an all-position automatic welding technology of single-sided welding and double-sided forming of the inner circumferential seam of a super large diameter steel pipe after many tests, and analyzed the factors affecting the welding quality. After repeated trials and adjustments of process parameters, a lower welding voltage (small molten pool) and a larger welding current (guaranteed penetration) are used to ensure a certain deposition efficiency, and finally stable welding quality is achieved. It has certain reference significance for the improvement and improvement of the automatic welding technology of single-side welding and double-side forming of large-diameter steel pipes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={At present, the history of Chinese ancient architecture has a long history and independent development. As early as The Shang Dynasty, Chinese architectural system has been initially formed. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it has always maintained its own structure and layout principles, and has been widely spread to other countries. BIM Technology is a rapidly rising digital modeling technology in recent years, which is widely used in the construction industry. Its intuition and accuracy have become the advantages of its rapid development. At the same time, BIM Technology can also better protect ancient buildings from the perspective of information. Starting from the ancient building restoration industry, this paper analyzes the current development trend of the domestic ancient building industry, and summarizes the key problems existing in the existing ancient building restoration methods. This paper analyzes and discusses the advantages and functions of BIM technology. According to the example of the old office building of Fengtian Zhaoxin Kiln Company, a BIM model is established. Starting from the application of BIM technology in survey and design, construction process management and repair of special parts, the actual application of BIM technology in ancient building repair is discussed, and valuable results are obtained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of China's economy, the status of the pillar industry of the construction industry has been highlighted. However, compared with developed countries and regions, the construction industry in China generally has many problems such as large energy consumption, weak management, low level, low profit, and dense personnel. The prefabricated building has entered the public's vision. The prefabricated building has the advantages of energy saving and emission reduction, reducing environmental pollution and high work efficiency. Therefore, the prefabricated building has become an essential construction method for the development of the construction industry. Although the assembly type has many advantages, but the complicated information, complex technology, design refinement and other problems restrict the assembly type technology level in China. Therefore, it is necessary to combine BIM technology to carry out prefabricated component deepening design, daylighting and energy saving analysis, three-dimensional visualization analysis, construction scheme simulation, site layout process analysis, quality process monitoring, etc., to find complex problems in design and construction and conduct visualization research. This paper takes a complex project as an example to carry out the whole process of BIM application in prefabricated building design and construction, which makes the building realize the integrated innovative design of structural system, electromechanical system and prefabricated construction. The maximal adaptability to the space of the complex building is created, resulting in a high quality construction that adds significant value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Tourism villages in the disruptive era inevitably have to adapt to technological advancements and the needs of millennials. The speed and clarity of information is a demand for the development of tourism villages today in addition to the innovation and uniqueness of tourist attractions. Efforts to build a model that is in line with these demands have begun to involve relevant stakeholders, i.e., village tourism managers, local governments, and tourists. Nevertheless, more in-depth studies are needed regarding the local wisdom of rural communities who are key actors in the development of tourism villages. This paper aims to explain the initial research in formulating a development model of smart tourism village based on information and communication technology. The case taken is tourism villages in Sleman district. A sampling of study cases in the form of tourism villages following the categories that have been determined by the Sleman Regency tourism office Initial search results show that there is no integration between village potential, systematic management, and meeting the needs of balanced tourists. This finding is the first step to formulate an ICT-based intelligent tourism village development model that is effective and efficient while still based on local wisdom in the effort to preserve nature and culture as a determining factor for the sustainability of tourism villages. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Irrigated agriculture has played a very important role in the history of mankind. In many respects, the irrigation technique was highly dependent on local natural conditions, and its development was the process of adapting local plant and water resources to the needs of farmers. The use of land reclamation in modern conditions must be environmentally and energetically justified. Comparing various irrigation technologies for the cultivation of garden plantings, we proposed the introduction of the agrotechnical technique "slitting"into the irrigation technology of garden plantings. Reclamation reception of soil crevice is carried out with a trailed modified unit of the "Slot cutter 2-140"brand, for cutting narrow slots of 3...4 mm, with a chisel located at the end of the cutting body of the slot, for cutting focal reservoirs, followed by accumulation of irrigation water. The research presents a method of cutting slits directed parallel and perpendicular to the aisles of garden plantings. After cutting the cracks, the soil is formed inside the soil - a natural water-intercepting and transporting network of focal reservoirs stretched along and across the entire perimeter of the garden irrigation module. The proposed cutting unit is mounted on a reinforced slot cutter frame on both sides. The distance between the two cutting tools is exactly 2 meters. Such a distance between the working bodies of the slot is dictated by the scheme for planting garden plantings. Irrigation of the garden is carried out by a surface method, i.e. flooding, an irrigation rate calculated for the complete saturation of the soil of the entire area of the garden plot with the lowest moisture capacity up to 100% of the lowest moisture capacity of the calculated meter layer. The proposed technology for irrigation of garden plantations with the obligatory cutting of over narrow slots with focal reservoirs will allow saving water and energy resources spent on the irrigation rate when growing garden plantings. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Coffee farmers, members of Kramatjaya Forest Farmers Group in Garut Regency West Java, use Perhutani's land to cultivate Arabica coffee. Apart from being a conservation area, this land is also arable volcanic soil and requires proper management that prioritizes coffee agribusiness aspects as well as ecological aspects, based on local and modern knowledge. This study implemented a knowledge management approach to reveal an understanding of local and modern ecological knowledge management in community coffee business practices. Empirical data were obtained through in-depth interviews and FGD. The research results show that for the last 10 years farmers have been utilizing Perhutani's land to cultivate Arabica coffee by implementing modern coffee equipment and also adopting local ecological knowledge in each sub-system. Local knowledge in the production sub-system is demonstrated by terracing systems. In the sub-processing system, local knowledge is used in coffee processing using traditional methods, along with uses modern equipment. The study also shows that knowledge generation derived from external and internal sources, knowledge transfer came from the role of community leader and field school training, and knowledge application of coffee processing used modern technology through community leader networks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Dumagat/Remontados belong to an indigenous community in Rizal Province, Philippines. Being the original inhabitants of the forest they have built strong ties to their lands as a result of living in the forest for generations. However, despite their rich knowledge in conserving and protecting their lands, these communities are still considered as an unimportant community in decision makings by lawmakers. Modern technology has made some of these communities leave the forest and settle in urbanized areas to find a better life. This research stresses the important role of Dumagat/Remontado's Tribe living in the upper Marikina river basin protected landscape, in managing and conserving the forest. The study involves interviews with the Chieftains of five selected villages and members of Dumagat/Remontado's tribe, site visits, and photo-documentations. Findings revealed all the communities still have strong ties to their traditional beliefs but communities that are still living in the forest and in their ancestral lands have stronger connections to their ancestral lands, traditional beliefs, and practices which have resulted in better management of the forest and its resources. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Sanitation on the domestic wastewater management (WWM) component was a severe concern in the slums of Margasari Village, which has two characteristics area, administrative neighborhood above water, and neighborhood on land. The universal access to adequate sanitation was only 35.8%. Therefore, Margasari Village belonged in the priority zone of sanitation risk at a very high level for domestic wastewater problems. The purpose of this research was to identify important factors to increase the adequateness sanitation on the black water domestic WWM in Margasari Village. The questionnaires spread on 345 household samples taken at 32 neighborhoods as the data collection method. Identification factors had done through two stages of analysis. The comparative descriptive analysis used to determine characteristics of the domestic WWM black water type obtained the findings that the neighborhood above water had low users percentage of adequate black water domestic WWM. Second, binary logistic regression analysis was to identify the factors that affect the adequatess domestic WWM of black water type, four significant factors encompassing household income, knowledge level, financing willingness, and ease of technology. Significant factors not only increased adequate sanitation, but also contribute to the development of appropriate environmental and public health policies related to slums settlement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Low Impact Development (LID) is a technology of rainstorm management and water pollution treatment developed in the late 1990s. As one of the LID measures, rain gardens can alleviate the urban rainstorm in Shanghai. Aiming at the low rate of environment utilization in the spaces of Shanghai primary and secondary schools, this paper proposes to collect the rainwater runoff from buildings and roads in the form of rain garden. We try to use artistic design techniques, and establish the campus environment with the value of rain and flood management, sustainability and biodiversity. The study results show that the sample rain garden covers an area of 310m2 with a water storage depth of 30mm, and has recorded 6 short-term heavy rainfalls and 1 overflow in 1 year. The biodiversity has increased by 70%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Global environmental problems include environmental pollution and the destruction of ecological balance that transcend national boundaries. With the continuous development of human life, economy, trade, and technology, the intrusion into the environment has continued to deepen, causing extensive destruction of forests and other vegetation, large-scale killing of organisms, environmental pollution, and invasion of alien organisms. This has led to a sharp decline in biodiversity and a serious imbalance in the ecological environment. At the same time, the continuous improvement of information technology capabilities and the introduction of big data management and related detection models have brought new methods to the detection and governance of the global ecological environment. Based on the data related to the spread of Asian Hornet in the United States, this paper proposes a method and model for monitoring the number and distribution of new species based on the SAR model. Based on the spatial relationship and the distribution data of the Asian Hornet in the United States from May 2020 to October 2020, and taking into account environmental and climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure, this paper conducts time series predictions to obtain the extent of the spread of the Hornet in the United States. The average RSME is 91.27, and a relatively ideal prediction result has been obtained, which proves that this model and method have a good effect on the control and management of alien species and the maintenance of ecological diversity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Currently, there is a lack of a practical and straightforward method to accomplish concealed facility positioning and maintenance work in power systems, such as a substation or power plant. On the one hand, it is hard to find the accurate location of a specific device that is on the ceiling or underground in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Another challenge is to provide useful information for facility maintenance workers and to bring a visible location image for them on the site. In this paper, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies are used to solve facility positioning and maintenance issues in power systems. First, the facility position can be determined by comparing the real RFID tag location with the virtual RFID tag location. Moreover, the target-related facility information for the maintenance work can be acquired by BIM models. Lastly, the live view of the specific location of a concealed equipment can be shown on a mobile terminal on the site by using a simple Augmented Reality (AR) technique. This paper, containing a substation case study, demonstrated that the BIM-RFID technology could achieve precise positioning, efficiency improvements, and re-visit times and costs reduction in power systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Coal gangue has become one of the industrial wastes with the largest annual discharge and accumulated stock in China. The disorderly accumulation of coal gangue not only occupies a large amount of land resources and causes natural disasters, but also pollutes the surrounding ecological environment, which in turn affects human health and normal production and life. In this paper, the physical, chemical and pollution characteristics of coal gangue are summarized, and the ecological restoration mode is divided into two modes: traditional "end treatment"and "treatment while piling". The action mechanism, advantages and disadvantages and application scope of various ecological restoration technologies involved in the two modes are listed, compared and analyzed, which provides scientific reference for the restoration and treatment of other similar geological environments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Smart farming is becoming increasingly important in providing technology infrastructure for the coffee agribusiness to develop a competitive value chain. On the other side, most coffee smallholders are characterized by limited access to technology and low technology adoption. As development and exploitation of technological capabilities, technology management would be a strategic way to promote smart farming implementation. Hence, this study aims twofold: (1) to identify the constraints in smart farming implementation, and (2) formulate technology management strategy in supporting smart farming for the coffee smallholder. The study was conducted in West Lampung, and the analysis method used pairwise comparison by using Saaty's scale. The analysis reveals that respondents' constraints related to knowledge and skills, technology, information, capital, organizational, and resources aspects. The results of this study provide useful information about technoware, humanware, inforware, orgaware, and cysnetware, as components of technology management, to support smart farming for the coffee smallholder. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The exploitation of lobster resources in the waters of the Central Lombok Regency, Indonesia is not effectively managed, causing problems in terms of resource availability and sustainability of lobster fishing operations. This study aimed to assess the status of lobster fisheries management and policy strategies for sustainable lobster fisheries management. Data were collected in three lobster fishing centres: Teluk Awang, Teluk Bumbang and Teluk Gerupuk. Methods used were a structured interview technique with questionnaires, focus group discussions (FGDs) and public consultation. The status of the lobster fishery was analysed using the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) indicators with six Domains. The lobster fishery management status was classified as "moderate"(aggregate score 50/100). The Fisheries Resources Domain scored 35, indicating that lobster stocks are in "poor"condition. Four dimensions had a "moderate"status: the Fisheries Technology Dimension (43), the Economic Dimension (48), the Social Dimension (53), and the institutional dimension (55). The Habitat and Ecosystem Dimensions was classified as "good"(67). Sustainable lobster fisheries management strategies include regulating fishing quotas, banning gears which catch lobster seed, and optimizing the use of selective fishing gear; establishing a working group for lobster management; managing water quality and zonation of lobster habitat; transfer of lobster farming techniques; and empowering community coastwatch groups. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The selected study area in Fisheries Management Area (FMA) 713 in Kartanegara District, East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia has extensive mangrove forests with suitable habitat for mud crabs (Scylla sp.), a valuable fisheries resource. Concerns have been raised regarding reported declines in the abundance of mud crabs and in the condition of their mangrove habitat. To evaluate the management status of the mud crab fishery in this area, an assessment was carried out using the Indonesian Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) methodology. The 25 indicators assessed represent 6 domains: Fisheries Resources, Habitat and Ecosystems, Fishing Technology, Social, Economic, and Institutional. The flag model technique was applied using multi-criteria analysis through an expansion of the composite index. The results indicate that the overall management status of mud crab fisheries in Kutai Kartanegara District was in the Moderate class (on a scale of Poor, Insufficient, Moderate, Good, Excellent). Indicators in the Habitat and Ecosystems, Fishing Technology, and Institutional Domains highlighted areas of concern where improvements are needed. The Fisheries Resources Domain aggregate status (moderate) indicated that wild mud crab stocks were still reasonably abundant and reliable, supporting the moderate status in the Social and Economic Domains, which relate to the welfare of fishing communities. The Institutional Domain status was in the poor category. Good governance measures to improve the Institutional Domain indicators have the potential to strengthen the other domains, in particular the Habitat and Ecosystem Domain and the Fishing Technology Domain, and to improve the overall EAFM status of the mud crab fishery in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Adaptive phyconomy supports holistic, sustainable marine ecoscape development as a component of integrated coastal area management (ICAM). Phyconomy is the branch of applied phycology that comprises systems of art, science and technology applied to production systems that yield crops of algae. Through the macroalgae known as "seaweeds", farmers turn seawater, sunshine, and effort into money. Adaptive marine phyconomy of tropical red seaweeds is an outstanding example of large-scale crop production that developed primarily from simple methods refined by farmers in the sea, but as of 2020 it is, still much more art than science. Phyconomy, ecoscape issues and market issues are intertwined in a way that demands holistic planning and management. Every phyconomy action is influenced not only by energy and materials issues, but also by issues among value chain stakeholder alliances. Ocean farming functions take place under conditions where environmental and socio-economic conditions are often uncertain, therefore adaptive approaches must be applied in a way that is resilient and sustainable. The present paper discusses how adaptive phyconomy art and science is being developed as a fundamental component of integrated coastal area management for sustainable marine ecoscape development in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The availability of water for irrigation has been decreasing and the need for other sectors has been increasing rapidly over the time. Whereas, there are also several environmental damages due to the serious exploitation of natural resources in many places. This situation causes the irrigation system has to be managed efficiently and effectively. In irrigation modernization, the implementation of intermittent irrigation is the right choice, because it is a water-saving irrigation technology. The model operation of intermittent irrigation operation that is built is a calculation model to determine the interval of irrigation water provision and the amount of irrigation water, which begins with the planning of the cropping pattern. The irrigation operation management model with intervals of providing irrigation water for 3 days developed in the Cihea Irrigation Area, Cianjur Regency has an influence on irrigation performance. The paddy planting season in Cihea, Cianjur Regency with intermittent irrigation operation, was able to achieve irrigation water productivity values> 0.8-1.0 kg / m3 (advanced stage in modern irrigation management). © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Oil palm plantation consists of several activities such as harvesting, manuring, and spraying are exposed to ergonomic problems in their routine work. Although many technology advances have been developed, harvesting process is still using manual tools and need strength, energy, skill, and technique which exposed to the high postural risk. The environment and work nature also hazardous to the workers can cause accidents and ergonomic pain. This study aimed to determine ergonomic risk factor such as worker's attitude, training, skill and management that influence to high pain experience, identify the common accidents faced by workers during harvesting activity and determine the relationship between risk factor toward pain and accident experienced. This study was conducted on 44 workers who involved in harvesting activity at Pembangunan Pertanian Melaka Sdn Bhd. The data were collected through survey method using structural distribution questionnaires and the data analysis involved were descriptive analysis, regression analysis and correlation analysis. The result showed that the common accident and pain experienced by the workers was neck, shoulder and lower back. Besides, the result showed that the training is the main factor that contribute to the high pain experienced and accident. Correlation analysis was found that there a positive correlation between training and ergonomic risk factor since the p-value is 0.02 less than 0.05. As a conclusion, this study gives an advantage in the oil palm plantation sector in terms of safety and health for future planning to reduce ergonomic pain and indirectly help in improve workers productivity. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Digitalization of capture fisheries data becomes inevitable in the present and future time. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the fisheries sector is widely applied, creating a bigger and better database. Development of the database offers the utilization of Big Data and Decision Support System (DSS) to provide robust analysis, simulate better scenarios, formulate recommendations, and propose management measures to support successful fisheries management in achieving sustainability and profitability objectives. Bali Strait sardine stock estimation has been conducted several times through several approaches and techniques. This study will combine the available times series catch and effort data from published statistic landing data and publications with real-time data from electronic catch monitoring in Muncar and Pengambengan fishing port. The sardine stock and fishery status estimation were analyzed using a stock-production model incorporating covariates (ASPIC), a Nonequilibrium surplus-production model to data on fish catch and relative abundance. Another purpose of this study is to increase stakeholder participation through a smart dashboard system that enables automatic data analysis, faster recommendations socialization, and engagement. Increased stakeholder participation in fisheries management will be a crucial factor in achieving operational and successful fisheries management. © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science},

abstract={Plastic waste is an emerging global and national issue. However, the global concern about plastic waste in the river system is even decreasing. Cimandiri Watershed is the most important watershed within the Sukabumi Regency area which flows to the Palabuhanratu Bay. Nowadays, the plastic pollution of the Cimadiri River water that ends up in the coastal area of Palabuhanratu becoming a sensitive and critical issue. Plastic waste directly threatens local coastal tourism as a major activity of the local economy. Each stakeholder is aware that plastic pollution is a consequence of anthropogenic activities along the stream of the Cimandiri River that are becoming widespread. Several policy steps have been taken by the local government, to resolve the issue and remain unsuccessful but they are still not successful. To resolve the problems, this paper aims to perform policy analysis to formulate the necessary priority policy strategy. The cause-effect analysis and gap analysis were used to resolve the appropriate plastic waste management behavior and management strategy. The management strategies for the proper management of plastic waste management in the Cimandiri River are improving community behavior by raising public knowledge, implementing legal regulation and social processes, developing technological innovation for the handling of transported plastic waste in the river flows and temporary community-friendly landfills, conduct more 3R (reduce-reuse-recycle) and waste bank management training and build policy affirmations on improving the management of plastic waste. © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science},

abstract={Biomass technology is a renewable energy source that is significantly used for cooking and heating, which when explored can reduce the use of fossil fuel. This study investigated the perceived role of extension education in promoting biomass technology for sustainable agriculture development in Nigeria. The study adopted the descriptive survey research design. Data were collected from 268 registered members of All Nigeria Farmers Association, Nsukka; and 22 Agriculture extension agents in Nsukka Local Government Area. Researchers-designed questionnaire which was validated by three experts was used for data collection. Mean and standard deviation were used for data analysis. Findings showed that sensitization of farmers on acceptability of use of farm wastes for biogas production; dissemination of information on renewable energy techniques to the farmers and sensitization of farmers on use of farm wastes for biogas production are perceived roles of extension education in promoting the use of farm wastes for renewable energy. Other perceived roles reported by the respondents include motivation of farmers on issues of renewable energy and provision of energy management advice to the farmers. The researchers recommended that efforts should be made to create awareness among the farmers on the use of farm wastes for biogas for renewable energy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={It is more difficult to construct stone subgrade than earthwork subgrade, so quality control should be strengthened in every link during construction. In the actual construction process, because the rock or geological structure is complex, blasting technology should be applied to achieve the purpose of earth and stone excavation. However, the application of blasting technology will bring many potential safety hazards, and even cause a large number of casualties in severe cases. Construction units should strengthen construction management, strictly regulate the application of technology, and avoid the occurrence of safety accidents. In order to ensure the high efficiency and safety of construction, the relevant engineering construction departments should fully display their guarantee function and reasonably apply the blasting technology. On the basis of introducing the engineering characteristics, this paper analyzes the construction requirements of earthwork and stone excavation of subgrade, and discusses how to correctly apply earthwork blasting technology in highway subgrade excavation engineering. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid growth in technology has created new innovation in the field of information technology. One of the innovations created from technological advancement is virtual reality that can be extended through virtual tour that provides real-time experience in exploring a space or an area. Nevertheless, preliminary research on the development of digital sector in heritage architecture only focused on historical site instead of building. Although there is an exploration paid to the heritage building, the effort is limited to colonial buildings and little attention has been given to the local heritage architecture. Hence, this paper aims to explore the development of 360 virtual tour of the traditional Malay house that is over 100 years old as one of an important measure to preserve, protect and interpret the built heritage and cultural history. The primary data was analysed from the building inventory through high-resolution photography using a fisheye lens digital camera. Photos collected were combined to create panoramic effect using a stitching technique. The 360 virtual tour application was developed based on the Multimedia Development Life Cycle theory. The findings show the application is produced as a digital database consisting of physical qualitative attributes data for university's management and recording for posterity. The outcome from this study has proved how technology converts the traditional learning and museum visit can become an enjoyable platform of learning, motivating and understanding of building structures and unique architectural details. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing number of disasters and high costs of damage highlight that financing is an essential part of managing community disaster response. As the most significant spending related to a disaster occurs after the disaster strikes, it can be challenging to know how much this spending could be reduced through preparedness in disaster management. This paper discusses the budget allocation of ex-ante programs on disaster risk reduction, focusing on education, knowledge awareness, capacity building, and risk communication. Special attention is paid to budget management programs in the Merapi Volcano area. A literature review is carried out to create a profile of the budget allocation for awareness programs in the whole disaster management cycle. It is found that the budget allocation for such programs is 7% of the total budget of the rehabilitation and reconstruction project and 20%-30% of the annual budget of the Local Disaster Management Agency. The findings demonstrate a need for alternative budgeting for ex-ante programs on disaster risk reduction to accelerate the targeted outcomes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Feature extraction is the most important application in spatial data management for updating of topography databases. The importance of features extraction from high resolution raster imagery arises from the fact that it enhances the efficiency of map generation and map production. Presently many studies have been addressed to extract topographic using semi-automated methods using various types of technologies. The objective of the study is to evaluate the planimetry accuracy of topographic features extracted using combination of high resolution and artificial intelligence algorithm. Conventional methodology for features extraction is time consuming and costly. Therefore, automated methods are crucial needed for efficient large area mapping with cost efficient. Maxar 0.3 cm high resolution raster imagery is an important issue in many application domains. The Maxar-Ecopia method is applied in this study to update the large-scale topographic map. Maxar-Ecopia method demonstrates the potential use of high-resolution raster imagery as main source and artificial intelligence algorithm for topographic feature extraction. The planimetric accuracy (RMSEr) of vector extraction is 0.882m. This method is highly accepted to be applied for rapid updating of large-scale topographic map. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Energy management control strategy is one of the key technologies in the development of extended-range fuel cell vehicles. During the use of vehicles, fuel cell performance will decline, which limits the power output of the stack and the life of the stack. In order to control the power output of the fuel cell more reasonably, in this paper, the lumped parameter model of fuel cell is built based on Matlab/Simulink, and the vehicle model is built by AVL/Cruise simulation software. Combined with the fuel cell health state (SOH: State of Health) estimation method, the vehicle demand power and the state of charge (SOC: State of Charge) value of the power battery are used as input, and an energy management control strategy architecture based on the performance degradation of the fuel cell is designed. The simulation results show that the designed energy management can improve dynamic performance, and avoid frequent start and stop of the fuel cell, prolong the service life of the fuel cell, and further improve the economy of the vehicle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Nowadays, rapid population growth has caused a high demand of land and stratified property especially in urban areas (big city). In cadastral system, visualization is considered as a tool for reflecting the real world which is commonly drawn in 2-Dimensional (2D) based plan. However, it only works efficiently for land parcel but not in representing strata property (high rise building). The complexity and overlapping boundaries also need to be considered in portraying 3-Dimensional (3D) model which cannot be achieved using only 2D plan. On top of that, the need of providing a 3D visualization platform has been recognised by many researchers worldwide. There have been numbers of 3D Cadastral system prototype being developed for different country such as Australia, Russia and Indonesia. 3D visualization helps enhanced communication between users, improve decision making, and helps to manage and facilitate land information system. This paper therefore seeks to analyse the problems related to the visualisation for the application of strata and the current approach of 3D visualisation. It is carried out by investigating different techniques and methods used in visualising 3D objects. The outcome of this paper would be the solutions in finding suitable visualization tools to be developed via Web-based visualization applications which are common with end users and easily accessible due to advancements in technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={As an effort to optimize the use of smart farming technology aimed at increasing efficiency in agriculture, a study was carried out at Agro-Innovation Park (Tagrinov), a place for education and learning of innovative home yard utilization concept. The smart farming applied in Tagrinov were irrigation control systems, pH and nutrition control systems of hydroponic plant, and temperature and humidity control in aeroponic systems. Those three monitoring and controlling systems were integrated in the mobile apps called Tagrinov 4.0. The deployment of control mechanism involved some systems, namely communication testing of android application using firebase server for irrigation; the Arduino Mega 2560 for pH level and nutrition control of hydroponic plant, and the Arduino Uno, DHT22 and DS18B20 sensors for temperature and humidity control of the aeroponic system. The test results showed some advantages of smart farming application in Tagrinov. Irrigation control system using internet network can be easily carried out by users. Arduino makes the system automatic, the pH sensor works as pH meter, the nutrients turn on and off when the pH value and nutrients are appropriate. The aeroponic sensor system read the temperature and humidity in the parent seed nursery, to activate the sprayer and makes the water become mist. All smart farming technologies were operated through mobile apps making these systems more efficient. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The activities related to agri-food production and the disposal of its waste account for a large number of greenhouse gas emissions. In many cases, food waste (FW) management is established by making a single assessment for its sustainability based on economical or environmental impacts. However, social impact assessments on stakeholders are often incomplete or missing, and its efficiency is seldom measured. Decision-making in waste management strategies, such as the acquisition of appropriate waste treatment sites or methods used, frequently involves multiple stakeholders such as government, municipalities, industries, experts, or public sectors. Due to the complication of differing criteria and alternatives in FW management technology, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology is recommended to certify the quality of the decision-making process. This paper reviews the use of MCDM as decision supporting techniques in modelling and analysing decision making in situations with multiple stakeholders for FW management. The synthesis results obtained through the MCDM tool will be more reliable when requesting confirmation from stakeholders based on a recommended minimum range of criteria for each sustainability dimension in the FW issues. Finally, potential studies in this area have been proposed. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Green building has become an important evaluation criterion for house construction. Prefabricated buildings are an effective means to achieve the goal of green building. However, the high cost during the construction process hinders the popularization and application of prefabricated buildings. Based on the current research, Building Information Modeling (BIM) Technology is an advanced technology in the construction industry, which has high efficiency in cooperation with prefabricated buildings. Based on BIM technology, it has better development in cost control of prefabricated buildings. Compared with traditional buildings, it has fast construction speed, high safety level, environmental protection, and other advantages. This paper analyzes the cost of influencing factors in the production and transportation stage, and establishes the cost management process of prefabricated buildings based on BIM technology. It analyzes the application of BIM technology from cost control, cost accounting, and cost analysis at this stage and finally verifies the feasibility of cost management based on BIM technology by taking a prefabricated building as the research object. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Asset management system is a crucial element of a utility project because it helps a company to inspect the asset inventory systematically. Besides, it improves productivity and proficiency of companies to position them better and increases their return on investment. The traditional system of data collection is very tedious in producing an asset inventory system. This study offered a mobile mapping system (MMS) by using 360-degree cameras to reduce the time and cost involved in data acquisition. The aim of this study was to locate, digitise, measure, and tag the assets along the street network. The efficiency of these 360 technologies was investigated to obtain asset data for a 3D street view utility mapping and provide important information. The obtained image will be used to determine the location of observed asset. The digitising process was required to label the detailed asset information as well as map the asset. This technology consists of a combination of camera, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). The efficiency of this technology was tested by mounting it on a vehicle such as car or motorcycle. The geo-referenced images were derived by using sensor models and were pro-cessed to produce a 2D information mapping for utility purposes. The study resulted in producing a digital map with Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial data and 360-degree imagery. Having such a system in place allowed to track the overall achievements of asset inventory, and thus utilised efficiency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The development of geospatial technology plays a significant role in online sharing of geospatial data and virtual updating. The National Security Council (NSC) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) are the two leading agencies responsible for handling Covid-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The government had stringently enforced various schemes and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to prevent the spread of the disease. As a support, the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM) through its Geospatial Defence Division (BGSP), has developed a Web Geographical Information System (GIS) application using its Defence Geospatial Information Management (DGIM) platform. A collaboration of geospatial data services has been made among government entities and security agencies in providing the latest information on COVID-19. JUPEM has also developed a Joint Common Operating Picture (JCOP) application for the NSC and Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) to strengthen its efforts to monitor and to avoid spreading the virus any further. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The adjustment of coal energy resource tax is an important price control method to realize energy saving and emission reduction and promote low-carbon economy. The global financial crisis and my country's economic recovery provide a favourable opportunity for coal resource tax adjustment. Combining the current background of the new era of energy conservation and emission reduction, the paper builds a China Energy CGE model based on the actual situation in China, and calculates the impact of ad valorem tax rates on different coal resources. The results of the study found that the coal resource tax reform has a weak negative impact on the economy. Considering the tax return scenario, it cannot only offset the impact, but also drive a small increase in GDP; the coal resource tax reform will not push up the CPI, deregulate electricity prices, and considering the tax rebate has a more obvious restraining effect on prices; the coal resource tax reform is conducive to improving the structure of domestic demand. Similarly, considering the tax rebate scenario, the effect is more obvious. Coal resource tax reform can reduce the output of high-energy-consuming industries, which is conducive to energy conservation and emission reduction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, prefabricated construction has been widely concerned with its significant advantages of high efficiency, environmental protection and energy saving. However, the prefabricated construction in China is in the initial stage, with more theoretical research than practical cases. Even with strong policy support, the development of prefabricated buildings is relatively slow. There are many reasons for this. The main reason is that the cost of prefabricated construction is too high for most developers to bear. This paper attempts to study the effect of BIM Technology on the whole process of cost management, aiming to solve the problem of cost compression in the implementation stage of prefabricated construction project and overcome the bottleneck of prefabricated construction development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Since the 21st century, China's urbanization process is accelerating, the construction industry has developed rapidly and become one of the pillar industries of the national economy, but the construction safety problems also follow. Although the progress of modern technology and management level can improve this problem to a certain extent, safety accidents still occur frequently in actual construction due to the complexity of construction process and the interference of many uncertain factors. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research on the prevention and control system of construction safety accidents, which is of great significance to improve the prevention and control ability of construction safety accidents and reduce the accident rate. On the basis of a large number of literature studies, this paper establishes an evaluation model for the prevention and control of construction safety accidents, analyses four levels including the risk of equipment failure, environmental risk, the risk of personnel failure and management risk, verifies the model through AHP, and gives weight to each index to draw relevant conclusions. Combined with the current situation of construction safety accidents in construction companies in recent two years, this paper discusses and analyses the problems existing in the prevention and control of construction safety accidents in construction companies, and puts forward corresponding optimization countermeasures, in order to provide assistance for the decision-making of the prevention and control of construction safety accidents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Outdoor navigation technologies based on GPS and Beidou has been very mature. However, due to the weakness of satellite signal and refraction, they can't satisfy the needs of indoor localization and parking area navigation in large commercial buildings. Most indoor localization technologies, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, are based on active equipment. Due to the implementation cost, they can't be widely deployed. In recent years, SLAM has been greatly developed and applied in the field of robotics and autonomous driving. For technologies such as stereo SLAM and Lidar SLAM require additional equipment, and meanwhile large scale computing will happen during point cloud matching, they are not suitable for civilian mobile usage. Considering the BIM technology, which can provide accurate 3D data of buildings, are widely used gradually, a real-time localization method combining monocular SLAM and BIM model is proposed to complete vision-based initial localization. First, we create the BIM model with the design drawings, extract the visible edge lines of model, and establish a 3D line feature database; then, intercept the key frames of the mobile camera, and extract the edge line and line feature descriptors from image, match the line features between key frames, triangulate the matched line segments, get the 3D line coordinate in first frame, mistake filter will be rolled out between multiple frames; finally, match the reconstruction result with line feature database form BIM model, register the initial position. This method can quickly and effectively perform the registration of monocular images and BIM models, get the initial position in complex spaces, and support the application scenarios such as indoor navigation, equipment maintenance, facility management, and construction monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The piezoelectric vibration energy collection technology utilizes the positive piezoelectric effect of the piezoelectric material, and collects the energy by attaching the material to a clamping structure and deforming under the external excitation, thus accumulating the charge and generating the potential difference. In this paper, the cantilever beam is used as a clamping structure because of its large deflection and simple structure. In this paper, the raindrop impulsion is applied to the piezoelectric material, the piezoelectric vibration energy capture device is used to improve the energy collection efficiency, and the electromechanical coupling model is established to simplify the potential energy analysis by using the conservation of energy and Newton's second law. In this paper, Runge-kutta method is used to simulate the differential equation, which reduces the computational cost of the system and has a certain precision for analysis and solution. Based on Al-'Ula's Bernoulli beam theory, the model was simulated by using the differential equation method and the ordinary differential equation group. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology in China, data has become the core of various fields and industries. The construction industry is the first to bear the brunt. The merits and demerits of data management can directly determine whether smart buildings are worthy of the term "smart". However, at present, the management level of most intelligent platform data of smart buildings is low, which cannot well adapt to and meet the development needs of smart buildings. Therefore, in view of the problems existing in the data management of the intelligent platform of the existing smart building in the era of big data, this paper conducts in-depth research and exploration, and points out the main restraining factors of the data management of the intelligent platform of the smart building. This paper expounds how to achieve more fine, safe and intelligent management of the data of intelligent platform of smart buildings in the era of big data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={At present, the construction of smart cities and smart parks in China has been widely concerned, and the intelligent decision-making in the process of urban planning, design, construction and management is in urgent need of refined, visualized, dynamic and integrated expression of urban entity information. Therefore, this paper studies a technical theory of digital description and expression of cities, namely CIM (City Information Model). Our team independently innovates, developing smart park management platforms. This platform is based on BIM (Building Information Model), GIS, IOT (Internet of Things) and other new generation information technologies. BIM mainly studies parametric information inside buildings, while GIS focuses on external spatial geographic information. IOT Internet of Things technology realizes the transmission and processing between information and data. This platform integrates and upgrades these technologies to build a smart park platform. This paper explores the presentation and current situation of CIM theory and technology under the background of smart city construction, smart park construction and operation and maintenance management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Climate change becomes a very complex and multidimensional issue, climate change will continue to be an interesting issue to study in relation to local policies, because besides climate change has global to local impacts, climate change can directly affect the condition of the natural environment and human behavior. The presentation in this paper aims to provide an overview of how the socialization of climate change issues carried out using information systems and technology can be successful by referring to knowledge development with data formed based on community perspectives. Factor analysis method is used to find the success factors of socialization in the face of climate change, then the regression analysis method is used to build a model of a number of variables that are formed from the analysis of output factors. The results of the study provide a number of new factors that can be represented as variables of public awareness of climate change, the process of socializing climate change and global warming, the availability of information systems and technology, and the management of knowledge management about climate change. The conclusion obtained from this research is that the momentum of the industrial revolution of the 4.0 era can be utilized to support the process of climate change socialization that is measured independently. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Innovation has changed the business paradigm globally in recent years. A model for enhancing innovative work behavior needs to be developed. This study aims to examine and determine the relationship between organizational learning and perceived organizational support for innovative work behavior through work engagement mediation. The study was conducted on 210 employees of CV. Laksana using the incidental sampling technique. This study used a questionnaire as a data collection technique. Researchers used SmartPLS 3.0 as an analysis tool. Researchers tested the relationship with various tests, namely the validity test, reliability test, hypothetical and simultaneous hypothesis testing. From the research result, it can be concluded that organizational learning has a significant effect on innovative work behavior. While the perception of organizational support has no significant effect on innovative work behavior. Furthermore, work engagement mediates the relationship between organizational learning and perceived organizational support for innovative work behavior. It is suggested for further research that researchers may use other variables to improve employees' innovative work behavior. It is also suggested for companies to be more concerned about the welfare of employees by fulfilling their rights and giving responsibilities following the work performed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The world is facing a global problem, namely Coronavirus (COVID 19). The Covid-19 outbreak in Indonesia has spread to various regions. The government has imposed social distancing and several regions have imposed Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) to break the chain of spreading covid-19. Large-scale Social Restrictions are restrictions on activities in areas suspected of being infected with Covid-19 to prevent its spread. Social distancing policy affects almost all sectors of life including the Education sector. One of them is with the issuance of Circular Letter No. 36962/MPK. A/HK/2020 on transferring face-to-face learning to online learning. This has an impact on the implementation of learning in higher education from learning ability and the supporting capacity of online learning in students. The method used in this study is quantitative descriptive. This research focuses on 10% of students of the Faculty of Social Sciences Universitas Negeri Semarang. Factors analyzed in this study include external, internal and contextual factors in online learning during the covid-19 pandemic. Data analysis was carried by reducing data, presenting data, until conclusion. The result of this study is that students have the ability to do online learning based on the ability to manage learning time, learning motivation, student discipline, it is supported by a good internet network, technology literacy skills as well as the ability to find learning resources. The support capacity of students in online learning is obtained optimally starting from the support of parents, easy communication with lecturers, interesting learning methods and media. The problem factor in online learning is that it requires a lot of internet quota, lecture tasks are considered excessive so it requires more time and effort management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Building sector focuses on surpassing challenges linked to energy efficiency and mitigation measures related to greenhouse gas emissions, in consequence, it needs to improve building performance in the interest of decreasing impact over environment. Buildings with reduced long-term operating cost, environmental-friendly and moderate construction costs can be achieved only by multi-object optimization and cross-disciplinary analysis, embodying a holistic approach. Following the main principles of the holistic sustainable design approach, the paper presents a sustainable experimental modular laboratory involving various strategy in regard with sustainable building, as resource, cost and material efficiency, health and well-being, environmentally conscious design, life cycle design, modular design, reusable/recyclable element, environment-friendly demolition method, safety design, consideration of life cycle cost, materials cost and waste disposal cost. Besides the installation of renewable energy sources and conservation of energy, the holistic construction of laboratory included also an integrated design with consideration for technology, operation and maintenance, which involved the implementation of a monitored energy management system. The system provides an accurate overview of the building's performance during operational phase. Although the monitoring is still in an incipient phase, recordings showed promising results regarding the behaviour of recycled-PET thermal wadding used for insulation and indoor comfort conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The costs of damages in both social and economic aspects are increased as a result of several significant earthquakes worldwide, the economic and social losses are a function of damage of the buildings because the buildings are vulnerable to earthquake damage [1]. In this study a probabilistic methodology FEMA P-58 is applied for seismic performance assessment for Iraqi educational reinforced concrete building in order to calculate the performance in terms of two aspects, the first one is the direct economic losses which include repair costs and repair time and the second one is social losses which include casualties and injuries. This methodology is prepared by ATC, the American Applied Technology Council and its prepared for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2012. The study is a continuation of other research papers related to applying the same method to the same building that the researcher undertook for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the building when exposed to earthquake and calculating the losses resulting from these damages by choosing different aspects of each research in terms of the method of simplified analysis or the calculation of damages and losses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={After the oil field enters the ultra-high water-containing period, the residual oil distribution is scattered, the excavation is difficult, the fine geology describes the large area application of the three-dimensional earthquake, the understanding of the underground situation is becoming more and more clear, the explanation of the oil layer is more and more fine, the redistribution of the fault is more clear, so that the excavation of the residual oil is more targeted. In the stage of the special high water-containing period, due to the restriction of the fault to the conventional measures, the residual oil can not dig, and the conventional measures can not dig the water after the effective control measures, and the deep-penetrating filling technology is used to fill the oil wells, which solves the problem of the residual oil excavation difficulties in the fault area, and achieves better development results. This paper expounds the working principle, process and effect of deep penetration filling technology and the effect obtained after the application of block, and puts forward a new management idea for oil and water well measures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The influence of effective microorganisms (EM), microbial inoculant containing yeasts, fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes was evaluated in field trials of Aerob 1 paddy cultivation in Jasin, Melaka. Aerobic paddy is a new way of rice cultivation in areas where water resources have been scare and affected by the climate change. As water shortage and climate change is becoming severe, the technology of growing rice with aerobic rice systems need to be further refined or developed to ensure the quality of rice production in water-short areas. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of additional EM on the growth pattern, and to evaluate the efficiency of EM uptake on the aerobic plant. This experiment was carried out by using random controlled Randomized Controlled Block Design (RCBD) consisted of three treatments with two replications in four blocks. Aerobic seed cv. Aeron1 was used as planting materials and has been applied by three different treatments of EM during vegetative growth. The treatment for this study was T1 = 1.8 g NPK with urea (control) while T2 was 1.8 g NPK and T3, with 0.9 g NP with 100 mL of EM respectively during 15 (early vegetative stage) and 45 DAS (late vegetative stage). The RCBD experimental design was used with two replications in each treatment in four blocks. There are three series of harvesting (35, 50 and 60 DAS) was conducted throughout this study. The growth parameter studied was shoot and root dry biomass, number of tillers, RGR at each of harvesting. Our finding revealed that the application of EM did not improve plant growth parameter but the growth pattern of T2 and T3 showed steady improvement, although not significant compared to T1. The application of EM at different growth stages did not enhance the relative plant growth rate of Aeron 1 under aerobic condition, but in comparison to T1 and T2, T3 treatment with 50% reduction of NPK and EM could significantly reduce the cost of land management and fertilizer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Innovation is an essential element of the economic development of modern organizations and enterprises. They have a dual impact on the dynamics of economic growth: on the one hand, they open up new opportunities for economic expansion, on the other, they make it impossible to continue this expansion in traditional directions. The state, society, business organizations are consumers of innovative products. This is why, as a research and educational system, many universities, especially National Research Universities, can become suppliers of innovative products based on their research, educational and manufacturing sites. The article considers one of the options for the possible integration of scientific and educational potential into the market of innovative products by organizing the work process of the Center for Expertise and Promotion of Innovative Urban Planning Products on the basis of the principles of system management: customer orientation, leadership, staff interaction, process approach, improvement, fact-based decisions, relationship management. This approach will ensure high productivity and will contribute to customer satisfaction with innovative products.

abstract={This article describes the relevance of using 3D visualization technology for construction projects. Despite the fact that the construction industry is not knowledge-intensive and is rather conservative in the implementation of innovations, these technologies can increase its competitiveness and ensure sustainable development of the country's economy. Advanced technologies allow increasing the company's revenues, reducing the cost of production, increasing the competitiveness and image of the company. They help to maintain current market positions and conquer new market segments. The use of innovations in the construction industry helps to optimize the use of the entire resource potential of the enterprise, increase the efficiency of using its labor, material, financial and information resources, reduce the cost of construction and installation work, accelerate the speed of information exchange and improve marketing activities. Innovations in the construction industry are introduced at all stages of the life cycle of a construction object: at the stage of project investment, design of a construction object, use of resource-saving and advanced construction technologies, use of energy-efficient building materials, application of innovations in marketing, production organization and personnel management. 3D visualization technologies play an important role in the management of construction stages and design of construction objects. However, today, not enough attention is paid to the economic assessment of the effectiveness of using 3D visualization technology for a particular enterprise. In this regard, the degree of elaboration of the topic is insufficient, and the research topic is relevant. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={BIM using is one of the most crucial and integral parts of building management. A complex BIM-model gives a precise picture of the project's final cost and can be used as a tool of budget measurement. BIM provides an opportunity to calculate all material and instead of manual calculating, it will change project cost estimate automatically if something in the project changes. In addition, it improves project economy and reduces the rate of random mistakes while project documentation assembling. However, experts in the construction industry acknowledge that the challenges that design companies face today in the transition to BIM are becoming more and more urgent. The article is devoted to the formation of a comprehensive view of the information model by stages of the life cycle. Through the implementation of information technologies in the field of investment and construction projects, achievable main problems allow for a new level of digital processing. Based on project lifecycle management, possible solutions to the identified problem blocks are proposed and their effectiveness is evaluated. Taking into account these changes, it will be possible to maximize the effective use of information modeling technologies at all stages of the life cycle of an investment and construction project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article considers the problems of enterprises using baromembrane water treatment technologies in technological processes. At present, the basic operational data required to monitor the operation of the equipment and to further analyze the efficiency of its use are collected manually, with the collected parameters recorded in the paper operational statements. To avoid the introduction of erroneous indicators and reduce the labor intensity of the process during manual data collection, it is proposed to develop and implement a software product that allows normalizing the parameters of the reverse osmosis installation by recalculating operational indicators taking into account correction factors. In addition, the developed software product allows you to build graphical dependencies of normalized performance, selectivity and pressure differences of reverse osmosis systems. In the future, the program code of the electronic program tracks critical deviations of the calculated normalized parameters and signals to the user the need for corrective actions. The article presents a study of the operation of the membrane plant for the life cycle of membrane elements (3 years). The results of the study of these processes with the help of the developed software product showed a high efficiency of identifying possible problems during the operation of reverse osmosis plants in the early stages, such as the formation of deposits and contaminants on membrane elements, which will significantly increase the service life of membrane elements in various industries. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The government has been paying attention to the issues of creation and implementation of comfortable physical, psychological and social conditions in the urban environment. In this regard, in order to increase competitive advantages and improve the sustainable development of urban areas, it is necessary to revise principles of city management, implement new approaches to the urban environment design, build new facilities, and develop programs for implementing advanced technologies. These goals can be achieved by moving into the existing spaces of "smart"cities. Innovative proposals and modern technologies are an integral part of any territorial development project. Smart cities operate at the intersection of digital technologies, breakthrough innovations and an urban environment, which should be a comfortable zone for work and life and a favorable place for implementing modern ideas. At the same time, innovative technologies implemented into the urban environment should not be a sign of scientific and technological progress. Their main purpose is to create territories with the sustainable use of existing opportunities and to focus on high quality public spaces interacting with citizens. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Russia is entering a new technological order. The transfer to the digital technological format will raise the national economy to a new level in the innovative orientation of all companies. At the same time, the digital economy is based on digital transformations of all industries. The implementation of digital technologies into the construction industry is an irreversible process. The digitization can radically transform the construction industry and create new opportunities for its development. Digital construction is based on the use of information and communication technologies for more efficient and high-quality execution of construction and installation works and management of capital construction facilities. Many new information technologies offer numerous opportunities for construction companies. However, to consolidate the position of a single digital space in the construction industry, it is necessary to develop new approaches to the interaction of all participants in the investment and construction activities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The world building sector is experiencing the global transformation stage. In this process, traditional methods of building and engineering are being refused. Innovative ways to manage investment projects are chosen. They refer to the intangible assets of the enterprise. In the Russian Federation, building digitalization is in its first phase. Nevertheless, the need for the integration of digital technologies is recognized by many brunch subjects and is approved on the state level. Many national projects and development strategies also endorse the course. The following problems caused massive engineering digitalization: the lack of needed information or its distortion that helps to decide on building investment realization, the growth of pressure due to reduced time, and price of projects' realization. The trend of digitalization of the construction industry determines the need to develop the scientific and methodological basis of the management theory of the introduction of advanced technologies. The article represents characteristics and the main aspects of the Construction 4.0 concept in three directions: intellectual factory, modeling engineering, digitalization, and visualization. It also describes and highlights the main provisions in the implementation of such intangible assets as digital document management and the Internet of Things. It is proved that implementation of control and audit procedures based on intangible assets are parts of the information model of the project and digital platforms. This way, effective systematic investment initiatives' realization can be provided on every building project control level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rational use of natural resources and environmental protection are crucial global issues. The article analyzes the experience of Russia and some foreign countries (Mongolia, China, and India) that have already launched a campaign aimed at developing environmentally friendly technologies. In Russia, this process has been recently initiated. The authors consider the problems of rational nature management in terms of protection of specially protected natural territories and implementation of innovative technologies by enterprises. Environmental threats hinder the development of specially protected natural areas and worsen the environment in specially protected areas. The article focuses on practical activities of environmental protection inspectors, presents statistical data on environmental offenses committed in specially protected natural territories of Irkutsk region. The development of environmental technologies is promising in Russia. "Green"and innovative technologies have already become the basis of many government policies and determine the development of new economic models. The experience of foreign countries shows a positive result of the use of the best available technologies, but the implementation of this mechanism requires time and various tools. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The authors consider actor-network relations in the interaction of providers and consumers of tourist services in the Baikal region, where tourism is integral to environmental management and sustainable development of the territory. The paper emphasizes the need for environmental management with a due regard to all stakeholder of the consumer-provider interaction system. The research method involves application of an actor-network approach. Using this approach allows us to identify not only "live"social networkers, but also other intermediaries who are not people. Currently, consumers of tourist services do not particularly need live intermediaries; their role is performed by non human intermediaries - wires and computers. The paper examines the role of information and communication technologies, tourist databases, transport, electronic booking systems, communication tools, and social networking in this relationship. The authors highlight that the development of tourism supports the local economy, which contributes to the sustainable development of the territory, but the linkage formation between the consumer and provider of tourist services is complicated by a large number of intermediaries Thus, it is surmised that the development of information infrastructure should be accompanied, or rather preceded, by the development of all other infrastructure elements (water supply, waste disposal and transport development). It was revealed that, the more connections and their diversity between a tourist camp and a potential tourist, the higher its stability and competitiveness, which can contribute to the sustainable development of the tourism industry in the Baikal region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={One of the uses that can be pursued in marine conservation areas (KKPD) is aquaculture. This is because aquaculture is one of the leading sectors and is the basis of Indonesian marine and fisheries production. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of sustainability of aquaculture utilization in the Biak Numfor District Marine Conservation Area (KKPD). The data analysis method uses the approach of sustainability analysis carried out by the MDS method (MultiDimensional Scaling) with the help of Rapfish software. Rapfish (Rapid Appraisal for Fisheries). The results showed that the analysis of Rapfish for the direction of the utilization of aquaculture obtained an ordination value of 44.80% or classified as less sustainable. Analysis results leverage for the direction of the utilization of aquaculture, it is found that there are 3 (three) attributes which are the most important indicators of sustainability from various other attributes, namely; cultivation technology (RMS = 8.81), number of business units (RMS = 7.00%), fish species and species (RMS = 6.85). The status of unsustainable aquaculture development in the KKPD is still ecologically profitable, However, economically, the contribution of the aquaculture sector has not been felt by the community. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The competitiveness of Indonesian pepper in the global market shows a decreasing trend. It is indicated by the decrease in the market and low product quality. Additionally, the consumer countries' standard requirements are also stricter, especially quality, sanitary, and safety. Microorganism contamination is one issue of pepper product safety. This condition is due to improper implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) as a strategic resource that can generate competitiveness by achieving the required quality and providing the agroindustry with sustainable competitive advantages. This study aims to map quality management practice and formulate strategies to implement the TQM in the pepper agroindustry. The analysis used Quality Management Mapping and Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM). Quality Management Mapping was used in analyzing constraints, and ISM was used to analyze the internal and external elements. The pepper agroindustry's quality management is traditional management, which has not to support the TQM implementation. Implementation of TQM in pepper agroindustry faces constraints related to training and preparation; understanding of TQM; TQM adoption within the organization; resistance to learn and change; learning organization; resources available; measurement of quality improvement; access to data and results; and attention to customers. Internal and external factors construct strategies to implement TQM. Internal-based strategies include training on the methods and concepts of quality, adopting technology, and using appropriate methodology and tools. The main strategy as external support is creating incentives linked to quality goods to support farmers shifting mindset and improving product quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Construction is a complex industry. A system like Building Information Modeling (BIM) has benefited many construction players in order to expedite their works effectively and efficiently in terms of design, implementation, and management of a project. As the construction industry involves many players such as clients, designers, contractors, and manufacturers, the existence of BIM can speed up planning time, minimizing resources, and even saving project costs. However, in some countries, the acceptance of BIM technology in the construction industry is still very low. This paper aims to explore and review the barriers associating with adopting BIM as a digital information tool in the construction industry. A systematic review was conducted of 26 journal articles and conference papers published between 2013 to 2019. The identified barriers were then classified and analyzed. The results of the study revealed that from the 26 selected articles, 15 categories of barriers have been successfully extracted and discussed. 15 categories of barriers are cost, law, experts, interoperability, awareness, culture, processes, management, demand, project scale, technology, skills, training, contract, and standard. The study offers significant insights for future research to overcome the barriers to the implementation of BIM. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The development of a digital management system to support historical building assets' management process based on public participation is the latest innovation in preservation, conservation, and restoration activities of historical buildings. In line with the importance of applying Good Governance principles in the 4.0 Industrial Revolution in Malang city government, it is essential to develop a Governance Digitalization system to support sustainable tourism in heritage tourism management. This study aims to establish a digital management framework system for Tangible Culture Heritage based on HBIM to manage historical building assets in Malang. This system focus on the cultural heritage assets of Malang City that represents the three developments in the Dutch Indies architectural style. The BIM capability implemented in historical buildings in Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) terminology can bring complexity and depth of information to historical buildings towards a sustainable lifecycle heritage management framework. This research implements the 3D modeling automatic reconstruction method (3D Laser scanner) processed with Building Information Modeling (BIM) based software. The process consisted of 3 (three) stages: identifying and mapping Historical Landmark Buildings, developing 3D content models, and generating HBIM data viewer application. This study's results reveal that using 3D laser scanning technology can accelerate the recording process and object modeling of the HBIM library, offering high accuracy and efficiency in recording complex structures and architectural elements. The final result of HBIM modeling is translated into interactively present the 3D model and 2D documentation of Historic Building Information Models through the HBIM mobile data viewer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Environmental problems, especially global warming, have become the main topics discussed recently, and one of the causes is coming from the construction sectors. Therefore, to reduce environmental damage and global warming caused by the construction sectors, design and planning of buildings refer to the concept of green buildings. Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), especially the Faculty of Technology and Vocational Education (FPTK), intended to implement the Green Buildings concept in the design and planning of the Center of Excellent (CoE) Technical And Vocational Education And Training (TVET) Building. For this reason, an evaluation of the implementation of the green building concept was carried out by using the criteria assessment based on the Greenship Assessment tool for New Buildings version 1.2 belongs to the Green Building Council Indonesia (GBCI). This research aims to obtain an assessment index and evaluate the green building concept in that building design. It was conducted at the Design Recognition (DR) stage, which is the assessment stage carried out when the project is in design and planning finalization. The data used is in the form of secondary data from the planner, including a plan drawing, BoQ (Bill of Quantity), and DED (Detail Engineering Design). The results generate ratings of greenship level at a percentage of 62.34%, with the predicated Gold. The category which generates the most point is the energy efficiency and Appropriate category with the improvement in building material used. Recommendations are divided into design recommendations (architectural) and management recommendations (non-architectural). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

funding_text 1={In 2011, Barcelona adopted a new urban strategy "Barcelona, City of People", aimed at introducing innovative technologies into the urban environment to improve the efficiency of urban management, stimulate economic growth and improve the well-being of citizens. The main goal of the adopted strategy was to consolidate the city's resources and direct them to increase the efficiency of the urban environment. The strategy is divided into 22 programs covering all areas of urban management. The main role in achieving this goal was played by the creation of a telecommunication network and the city platform CityOS for collecting and accumulating relevant information (air quality, temperature, noise level, road traffic, energy efficiency, etc.), which can be used jointly in management issues, and also for predicting and preventing emergencies. The City OS was developed with financial support from the European Regional Development Fund for Catalonia under the Cataluña ERDF 2014-20 OP program aimed at accelerating economic growth in Catalonia and Europe, as well as developing a green economy. The Barcelona City Council has partnered with US-based technology company CISCO and other technology partners to create open source Sentilo software using data from the Spanish Libelium's Waspmote sensors. Waspmotes sensors collect information and transmit it to the Sentilo platform via ZigBee and 802.15.4 at 868 MHz and 900 MHz, as well as Wi-Fi, BLE and 3G / GPRS. It's worth noting that since Sentilo software is open source, it can be adopted by any city or business.},

Contribution of Information Systems and Information Technology were required by companies to provide an easy way in the exchange information systematically within the company, and its application was in line with the company's business goals. However, there were still found a company where this case study was conducted that had not yet comprehensively considered the implementation of it. This indicated that the implementation of Information Systems and Information Technology within the company are not well planned. Research conducted was a case study that paid attention to a particular case conducted on individuals or organizations as a study material. In the case study, research was focused on finding and collecting data on research objects to provide solutions to problems that are happening so that this research is descriptive and exploratory. This study, resulting in the IT Master Plan, consists of enterprise architecture planning to overcome the existing problems through the proposed solution concepts in modularity, integrated systems, standardized platforms, and service-oriented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Monitoring is an important part of project management with the aim of knowing how far the project is running and whether there are obstacles during the project's running. At present, this monitoring process cannot be done in real-time, and conventional monitoring tends to be expensive and error prone. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a technology that began to be developed to overcome these problems. The research discussed the use of UAVs for real-time monitoring, with quantitative and qualitative methodologies using primary and secondary data. The results of the research indicate that: (1) UAVs produce 3D photogrammetric that provide more detailed and easier results in real time monitoring, (2) The use of UAV is 35,41% faster, accuracy reaches 71.22%, more economical up to 78%, productivity level of up to 94,48% compared to conventional methods, (3) Limitation of UAV capability in conducting real-time monitoring, including battery power, and not yet waterproof. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The current public transportation system must improve the quality of its services so that they can go hand in hand with technological advancements. Transportation, as a supporter of economic progress and development of the country, is expected to be able to answer the high mobility of the community of transportation needs by utilising the expansion of existing technology. Tracking and monitoring bus locations as public transportation is now an important issue that needs attention, but there is no bus tracking system based on mobile that can provide real-time locations. The research aimed to design a wireless sensor network that automatically identified and provided accurate information about travel routes and the movement of public transport buses in real-time. By using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) as vehicle tracking systems and sensor that support, this application provided bus position information and the nearest bus route recommendations to users in real-time. Thus contributing to the time management of public transport users in their activities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Traffic Violation Detection system using radio frequency identification (RFID) has been applied to detect vehicles with limited power sources through RFID Tag. Camera sensors are also applied to identify a vehicle and its plate number through image and video processing known as computer vision. On the other hand, vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to gain information about location, speed, and so on through the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connection. Lastly, the internet-of-things that is backed-up by cloud computing helps to store various information from each of these technologies and process them to get results. Many researchers have proposed and developed algorithms or technology with astonishing experimental results of them. However, there has been no review of the integration and reporting mechanism that correlates them. There has also been no review about how to connect the information to the authority and violator. Therefore, the review was made to explain each technology's method with their experiment's results and issues. Moreover, the future challenge also had been given to further research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Increasing access to proper sanitation in urban areas in Indonesia has not been accompanied by the availability of a domestic wastewater disposal system that is safe for the environment. The existing domestic wastewater management system is felt to be unable to prevent pollution. Several studies have reported contamination of water bodies in several cities originating from domestic wastewater that has not been appropriately managed. This paper aims to discuss the developments of the domestic wastewater management system in Indonesia by exploring the current conditions and challenges. The service capacity and application of domestic wastewater treatment technology at wastewater treatment plants already operating in Indonesia will be discussed to find out the existing comparisons. Several regulations related to the domestic wastewater management system also be reviewed to find out the policy direction of pollution prevention efforts. From the conditions exposed, it is necessary to evaluate and adjust the existing concepts to the progress of developments in the field. More significant effort is needed to find solutions for problems and realize the domestic wastewater management system's implementation to achieve the desired goals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The global food production process is being threatened due to the uncertainty experienced in the weather pattern, especially the agricultural sector being placed at the risk of unpredictable climatic conditions. Moreover, climate uncertainties, such as floods and drought, directly and indirectly, impact the level of crop failure. Therefore, Indonesia's Government has launched a program known as the Rice Farm Insurance (AUTP) in 2015, using a state-owned enterprise as the single administrator to manage these challenges. However, several other problems have been discovered using this program, such as the low level of farmer participation, unprofitable portfolio management, and a limited number of farm areas. Therefore, this research aims to formulate an AUTP optimization strategy through the private sector's involvement to mitigate these problems. The private sector's inclusion in managing crop insurance is due to the US and some Asian countries' success concerning its more comprehensive access to innovation, technology, and resources. The Analytical Hierarchical Process approach is a decision-making technique developed for cases with multiple analysis levels and used with the primary data obtained through questionnaires distributed to 5 experts representing the government, the general insurance industry, researchers, and farmers. The results showed that the influential actor was the government; the most successful factor was a collaboration among stakeholders. The prioritized objective was to increase farmer participation. The selected strategy was to form a consortium of public and private sector enterprises. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The Utilization of nuclear technology has an inherent risk due to its radiation hazards that may trigger nuclear technology failure disasters. The government agency designated for coordinating disasters management activities in Indonesia is BNPB. As knowledge on nuclear hazards will influence attitudes and concerns for preparedness towards nuclear disaster, the research aimed to analyse the knowledge and attitudes of the BNPB leaders towards nuclear disaster threat in Indonesia. A case study qualitative method was used to explore and analyse the knowledge and attitudes of the BNPB leaders towards nuclear disaster threat in Indonesia. The research used knowledge and attitudes indicators for dealing with nuclear disaster threat derived from the natural disaster preparedness parameters, developed by LIPI-UNESCO / ISDR (2006), and the nuclear emergency preparedness requirements, develop by the IAEA (2015). In general, the results showed that the knowledge and attitudes of the BNPB leaders are sufficient (56.25%). While knowledge of causes, potential, types of events that may trigger nuclear disaster is sufficient, on the other hand, the attitudes towards nuclear disaster risk is still deficient. Thus, increasing the knowledge and attitudes on nuclear disaster threat, there is a need BNPB to enhance its role as the disaster coordinator to include coordination of exchange of information and knowledge of nuclear hazards with other related ministries/ agencies, such as BAPETEN and BATAN, into its program. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Limboto Lake has environmental degradation due to the high sedimentation rate. Based on that fact, monitoring of inundation change is needed for upcoming lake management. The dynamics of Limboto lake inundation can be detected by utilizing remote sensing data. The emergence of cloud computing-based geospatial technology allows its users to automatize remote sensing data preparation and processing procedures. The study attempted to investigate the dynamics of Limboto lake inundation within the time frame of 2001-2019. The detection was conducted by incorporating the Landsat data and water index method through Google Earth Engine (hence, GEE) interface. The observation year was chosen to start from 2001 due to the Landsat 7 ETM + images were completely available for a year (11 months). The results displayed that the lake's inundation area's dynamics during the observed time frame tended to show a trend of shrinkage in size. The shrinkage mostly took place at the west and northwest part of Limboto lake. The shrinkage that occurred at the lake inundation area is to be treated as a warning sign for decision-makers to formulate a decision to handle the potential negative impacts of the lake inundation shrinkage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In order to better solve the new problems encountered in the national development, China is gradually establishing a new national territory spatial planning system. It can implement the requirements of whole-area and multi-element control of land and space. Underground space planning is a special planning in the new spatial planning system. We will explore how to scientifically and reasonably prepare underground space planning. Combined with the planning practice of Beijing and Sub-Center, we propose that the underground space planning system should be further improved, especially at the regulatory planning level. It can not only refine the master planning requirements of underground space, but also effectively guide the detailed planning and project construction of underground space. This paper attempts to put forward the main characteristics of underground space regulatory planning, hoping to provide reference for other cities' underground space planning. The first is ecological priority and limited utilization. Detailed geological survey is the basis of underground space planning. In the Sub-Center, we evaluated the requirements of geological ecological protection and the impact of geological disasters, and delineated the three-dimensional utilization boundary of underground space and the influence scope of geological disasters. The second is the improvement of space management and space vitality. We explore the allocation method of underground space covered area, and divide the covered area into each construction site, giving priority to the key areas such as Universal Studios and metro station areas. The third is multi-dimensional utilization and planning integration. The underground facilities are planned in depth and intensively. The plan puts forward detailed in-depth layout guidance, focusing on the construction of Facility Service Ring, and coordinating the intensive construction of underground tunnels, metro and underground municipal facilities. The fourth is to encourage the application of new technologies. The planning will reserve sufficient space for future development, such as the construction of underground logistics, multistage rainwater collection and underground heat utilization in the Sub-Center. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Gama Hospital is a well-known private hospital in Taiwan. In addition to medical treatment technology, hospital management and cost control are also excellent. Regarding the treatment of medical waste, one must consider the cost and also the environmental implications. Waste disposal, besides the inevitable treatment after its emergence, should be given more attention during the course of medical execution. In the practice of the hospital, the actual waste treatment cost was reduced. The main factor is that the hospital promotes a series of waste treatment education and training. In addition to medical personnel, patients and family members also participate in medical waste reduction and correct handling activities, successfully completing the hospital's waste reduction target and achieving sustainable environmental social responsibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The flue gas emission of the building ceramics industry accounts for 85% of the whole ceramic industry in China, and it is the critical sector of air pollution control in the ceramic industry. The advanced available techniques (AAT) of air pollution prevention and control are of considerable significance to promote the upgrade of pollution prevention measures and technological progress. The paper studied and established the method of screening and evaluating the AAT for the prevention and control of air pollution in the building ceramics industry. Through collection and analysis of three normal pollutant emission concentrations of ten available techniques (AT), to select the AAT that meet at least one pollutant of all the plants was lower than 50% of the national standard emission concentration threshold in China. Based on the experience of the European Union and the comprehensive evaluation of industry associations, research institutions, and pollution control experts, five AAT were selected. The findings will provide an essential reference for the building ceramics industry to select advanced techniques, and provide significant technical support for the revision of the ceramic industrial pollutant emission standard for and selection of pollution prevention and control techniques (PPT and PCT) for pollutant discharge permission management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The development of geothermal fields in Indonesia is carried out under the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, namely Geothermal Law No. 21 of 2014 and Environmental Protection and Management Law No. 32 of 2009. Based on Law No. 21 of 2014, geothermal business activities consist of preliminary surveys, exploration, and exploitation. After the exploration phase (a detailed geological, geochemical, and geophysical study), a pre-feasibility study is needed to determine the feasibility of exploration drilling. The pre-feasibility study is done to manage project risks. Danau Ranau geothermal field is one of the 166 medium enthalpy geothermal prospects in Indonesia. Activities carried out in this field were geoscience studies. This research was conducted to determine how feasible the Danau Ranau medium enthalpy geothermal field was developed for direct and indirect utilization by looking at the acceptance of technical, financial, environmental, and risk studies. The study can be a tool for the developer to decide whether to continue the next development stage. The result shows that applying the approach for Danau Ranau Geothermal Field is feasible to develop with consideration. Plant of Development by cascade model with leveling utility of energy for Danau Ranau Geothermal Field shows optimal value both in the operational and financial sides. The first level is technically designed for electricity with ORC conversion technology and the cascade level for indirect use by Lindal Diagram and community empowerment in economic and social.

abstract={Tsunamis are one of the most frequent deadly natural disasters in Indonesia. The tsunami came suddenly and destroyed everything in their path. Reporting from the BNPB website, a tsunami consists of a series of ocean waves capable of traveling at speeds reaching more than 900 kilometers per hour or more in the middle of the sea. Tsunamis are triggered by several factors, namely earthquakes and debris on the seabed, or due to volcanic eruptions at sea. No technology can predict exactly when a tsunami will occur. Therefore the mitigation process is needed as preparation to face a disaster. The geographical position of the southern coast of Blitar Regency is recorded as a tsunami-prone area due to the shift in the Indoaustralia and Euroasia plates and directly adjacent to the Indian Ocean. In this study, an analysis of the risk level of a tsunami disaster in the coastal area of Blitar Regency will be carried out as the first step for disaster mitigation to minimize the occurrence of casualties using a grid-based analysis. The process is carried out using spatial data in the form of points, which are then interpolated so that the new points are obtained. Risk analysis is obtained by three parameters, namely hazard parameters, vulnerability parameters, and capacity parameters. The area affected by the tsunami hazard in the Blitar Regency spreads over 14 villages in Blitar Regency. The area affected by the tsunami in the 10m-height model is 655.76 hectares. The village with the largest inundation area is located in Sumbersih Village with an area of 97.52 hectares. In calculating the level of vulnerability, it is found that the level of vulnerability in the coastal area of Blitar Regency is in the medium class. Furthermore, the risk analysis shows that the area at risk of tsunami in the run-up model is 10 meters covering an area of 655.76 hectares, a low-risk area of 74.69 hectares, a moderate risk area of 211.44 hectares, and a high-risk area of 369.62 hectares. Hectares. In Bakung District, there are no areas with a high level of risk. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={High yield and low methane emission are two goals in tidal swampland management systems. In tidal swampland, draining converts soil organic matter to be oxidized and release emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. Organic matter has been used as a soil amendment to improve the properties of this soil. Methane is produced by anaerobic soil bacteria, methanogens, and methanotrophs, by utilizing organic matter from the soil and rice root exudates, and it is transported to the atmosphere through aerenchyma. In wetland soil, rice straw incorporation with and existing vegetation are a source of organic matter to improve soil fertility. However, management of organic matter with a traditional system called "Tajak, Puntal, Ampar"often increase methane (CH4) emissions, one of the main sources of anthropogenic CH4. A portion of organic matter decomposition in saturated soils yielding methane (CH4) rather than CO2. Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases and is known to be a major cause of global warming. We analyze each of the components of technology and its relation to lessons learned. The environmentally friendly technology in tidal swampland includes: water management, land preparation and land management, amelioration and fertilization, use of low-emission varieties, and intercropping. Implementation of this technology in swamps can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a framework for environmentally friendly farming in the wetland for food production, which includes (1) the characterization and problem of soil; and (2) environmentally friendly technology. Implementation of this technology in swamps can reduce GHG © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Climate change that increases the ocean surface temperature has affected life in the ocean ecosystems. Fish migrate from their natural habitat and seawater intrusion will affect the coastal ecosystem, so that fishermen need to adjust their fishing methods. Indonesia's oceans hold enormous fisheries potential wealth and enormous potential economic value that needs to manage properly. For decades, the traditional and local wisdom in coastal communities has become the prime movers of marine and fisheries development. Unwritten customary rules in fisheries resource management are presumed to be a factor in the loss of local communities' wisdom in the modernization era. The customary institution's effectiveness in the implementation of compliance and supervision of customary rules is prone to degradation and this is partly due to the current generation's lack of local knowledge and the rapid development of fisheries management technology, which in some cases is a threat to the preservation of marine ecosystems. This research was a normative study based on primary and secondary legal materials. This research aimed to revitalize traditional fisheries rights in the management of Indonesia's marine resources. The result showeds that some hereditary traditional knowledge made indigenous peoples more able to adapt to climate change so the involvement of indigenous peoples and the fulfillment of their traditional rights must be considered in fisheries management policies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The agroecological zone (AEZ) is a land potential information system for land use planning and commodity development. AEZ contains information on landforms, elevation, topography, soil characteristics, temperature, etc. which is useful for determining the suitability of land and commodities. This study aims to determine the technology requirement based on the limiting factors found in each land unit. The methods of determination of land suitability and technology requirement were carried out using the FAO standard land evaluation program, by matching land characteristics with plant growth needs. Through the application of recommendation technology that suitable for land capability, the cultivation system becomes more adaptive to the environment, so that the possible negative impact of climate change can be minimized. The limiting factors found as constraints to the development of food crops in the Boyolali District include (a) temperature conditions, (b) rooting conditions, (c) nutrient retentions, (d) erosion hazard, (e) land preparation, and (f) flooding hazard. Based on existing limiting factors, land management should be focused on (a) using adaptive varieties to local temperatures; (b) providing organic fertilizer to improve soil drainage, organic C and CEC soil; (c) lime and soil ameliorant application to increase base saturation, deep and reverse soil treatment to increase CEC; (d) conservation-oriented planting system and (e) eradication of rocks with minimum tillage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The relevance of the presented research stems from the need to develop new methods of automation of on-farm land management using modern geoinformation technologies. The aim of the study is to develop and implement new methods of geoinformation technologies to automate the process of land management in agricultural enterprises. The object of the research is new methods of geoinformation technologies, which allow automating the process of performing a cameral stage of work on land management design and organizing an information base for agroecological monitoring of the territory of agricultural enterprises. To achieve the goal of the study, we developed a geographic information model for creating land management projects to provide an ecological and economic justification for land use. For land management projects with the aim of designing crop rotations, the main initial data are: relief; agro-industrial soil groups; agricultural plots; ecological and technological groups of arable land. This model was tested on the example of SPK im. Kuibyshev, Kinelsky district, Samara region. In the work, the influence of the conditional working length of the field on the productivity of the equipment was studied and analyzed, an equation was obtained for the dependence of the time losses for idle turns and arrivals on the length of the run (average conditional length of the field). The application of the obtained formula in the automated system of economic substantiation of options for the organization of the territory of crop rotation in the preparation of projects for on-farm land management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={At present, total station or gnss-rtk is often used in mine ecological environment restoration survey, which has the disadvantages of high intensity, long cycle and high cost. In particular, the problems of landslide and collapse in abandoned mines bring potential safety hazards to the surveying and mapping personnel. The traditional surveying and mapping results are 2D graphics, and the information of topography and geological disasters is not intuitive, which brings inconvenience to the design of ecological environment restoration scheme. In order to meet the actual needs of mine ecological restoration, UAV incline photogrammetry technology is applied in the survey and mapping, scheme design and construction management stages of mine ecological environment restoration. The research results show that UAV incline photogrammetry technology can realize: ensure the safety of technical personnel, make the survey and mapping more efficient; make the mine environment information more intuitive, vivid and vivid, which is conducive to the formulation of ecological restoration plan, dynamic grasp of construction progress, and make mine ecological restoration more accurate. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={the purpose of my research is to put in place an adaptation technology to the Sonara company so that it can increase its production efficiency. SONARA is a processing type of enterprise for light type raw materials. However, heavy oil is currently being produced in Cameroon and there is a mismatch between the existing processing tool and the available crude oil. The enterprise is a semi-state company, most of whose shares are owned by the Republic of Cameroon, up to 80.29%: National Hydrocarbon Company, Stabilization Fund for Hydrocarbon Prices, National Investment Company and the Ministry of Finance. The state wants to increase the capacity of the refinery of finished petroleum products from 2.1 million to 3.5 million tons per year, and modernize all these infrastructures including its managerial system. the company aspires to live up to the expectations of the Cameroonian population and help the country which is advancing towards its emergence by 2035.The second phase of the modernization project, which has not yet begun, will consist primarily of the installation of a hydrocracking system to process heavy crude oil produced in Cameroon. The storage volume of SONARA is currently estimated at 132,500 m3. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Belawan Port is one of the main ports in Indonesia whose role and function are important in the national logistics system. Belawan Port is a gateway for the Province of North Sumatra. The port must have sustainability in carrying out its role and function as transportation and economic infrastructure. In this research, Belawan Port sustainability will be evaluated from several aspects or dimensions, namely ecology, economy, social culture, technology, and institutions and law. Belawan port sustainability analysis using the Multidimensional Scaling method, using the modified Rapfish program. The analysis is carried out on five dimensions and 49 attributes/factors, which are used as a reference in the SDGs program. Not every SDG will be relevant for every business, however, every SDG should be considered. SDGs no.4 and no.5 are not directly related to port management activities, while SDGs no.8,9,11,14,17 are directly related. From the analysis obtained Ecology sustainability index = 48.38 (less-sustainable), Economic sustainability index = 42.89 (Less-Sustainable), Socio-Cultural sustainability index = 52.47 (Fair-Sustainable), Technological sustainability index = 54.11 (Fair-Sustainable), Institutional and Legal sustainability index = 50.74 (Fair-Sustainable). With policy and program interventions, the sustainability of the existing Belawan Port in the short term can be improved to be fair-sustainable for all dimensions (ecology, economy, social & culture, Technology, Institution & Law) evaluated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article deals with the issue of modelling the technical condition of a low-pressure earthen dam of rice systems using numerical calculation methods. The primary task of operating irrigation systems is to rationalize water use by increasing the technological level, improve water management through the use of water-saving technologies and optimal operating modes of the on-farm network of rice systems. Rice is the most productive and water-intensive crop. The most widespread rice cultivation in Russia is in the South, namely in Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Adygea. The problem of water scarcity in the cultivation of modern rice varieties requires the development of new science-based technological solutions to comply with the regime at the entire stage of cultivation, primarily aimed at saving water resources. Modern approaches and solutions of water regime management at the entire stage of cultivation are relevant with a constant increase in the volume of rice cultivation. A number of numerical experiments were carried out, which can be divided into two groups. In the first group, numerical calculations of the low-pressure earthen dam of the rice check were performed without the formation of landslide processes, where the goal was to establish the adequacy of solid-state models of the stress-strain condition with existing field tests. The pressure from agricultural machinery passing through a low-pressure earthen dam is taken into account. The second group consisted of numerical calculations of low-pressure earthen dam rice check in the formation of landslide processes in the presence of defects, the result of which was to obtain the maximum allowable sizes of damage. There were performed the simulations and evaluated the impact of the identified damage to the technical condition of the structures of on-farm network of rice systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Styrax resin is a major non-timber forest product from North Sumatra, Indonesia. However, thousands tons of raw resin are sent abroad, while various styrax oil-based products worth US millions dollars are imported annually. Limited harvesting and processing technology are some of root of causes the lack of styrax oil-based industry development in Indonesia. The objective of this paper was an overview of styrax forest management in North Sumatra, efforts to increase the added-value both quality and quantity of resin, and an alternative processing of raw material into a perfume innovation. Benzoin resin is produced by the injured inner epithelial bark of styrax tree. Therefore, tapping of bark is the best effort to harvest the resin. But, styrax forest management has been carried out traditionally, including harvesting techniques. One of scheme to increase added-value is resins processing into a perfume products with high economic value. The innovative products begin from extracting a solid styrax resin into pure essential oil. There are two methods used, namely (a) extraction with solvent, and (b) distillation method. The amount of yield of benzoin oil produced by solvent method is influenced by incense grade from 23.9 to 34.6% and higher than another method. But distillation method also produces high quality and quantity of hydrosol (side product) with a distinctive aroma. Combined with various essential oils from Indonesia's tropical forests, the styrax oil becomes a fixing agent for a signature perfume that formulated by considering the gradation of aroma in accordance with release of constituent essential oil particles. Processing resin into an essential oil increases the added-value of styrax resin. Innovation of styrax resin based products will explore the fragrance formulation of this commodities therefore reduce our country dependence on imported perfume and raw materials used for various personal cares. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to avoid construction project losses based on the normalized situation of prevention and control new crown epidemic. This paper takes an example of Shu Xiang Garden project in Anhui. An early warning system of epidemic risk based on was constructed and applied to risk analysis. Index system and expert survey were conducted to identify the risk factors and divide them into major risk and general risk. In addition, this paper carried out a special assessment of interpretative structural modelling to directly reflect the influence factors of the cost risk. The results show the overall risk belonging to level III is extremely high risk and risk management is the most critical factor to reduce the cost risk. The paper concludes with recommendations from four aspects of epidemic control, balanced progress, information technology and risk transfer to reduce risk and provides a theoretical basis for epidemic risk management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The main task of using information technologies is not only the automation of labor-intensive processing processes, a large amount of data, but also the acquisition of qualitatively new information resources. Taking into account that information technologies today play a very important role in the development of various socio-economic processes, it is important to understand that they must develop and improve. Today, there are many problems in the development of modern information technologies, which is invariably reflected in the level of economic development of Uzbekistan. The first important issue is the training of information technology personnel. In order to get good specialists, the training process must be properly organized, centralized, and must be carried out using modern technologies. Also among the topical problems of modern information technologies are the prevalence of foreign information technologies in this area and a low percentage of domestic ones. In addition, an equally important problem of the information space of Uzbekistan is the lack of coordinated work between its individual information sectors (commercial, regional, state). The lack of proper interaction between these sectors leads to their ineffective work. It should be noted here that in Uzbekistan different regions have different degrees of information content. And this is the main constraint on the development of information technology. After all, it is the high level of informatization of citizens that is a necessary component of social progress. The presented work describes an automated farm management system of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which was implemented within the framework of a scientific project of the Ministry of Innovative Development of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The experience of application, implementation of information technologies, information systems, scientific search systems and databases for processing, storage, analysis of data and results of scientific research, organization of research activities in the agricultural sector. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Because of the high complexity and large scale of transmission line engineering, a large amount of data will be generated in the traditional two-dimensional (2D) design process, and the work of each stage is relatively independent. The design results are difficult to be effectively managed and integrated, and timely information interaction within and between specialties can not be achieved. BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology has powerful functions of digitalization and information management. This paper studies the application of BIM technology in three-dimensional (3D) design of overhead transmission lines. With the help of Revit platform and secondary development technology, combined with "Xinfu 110 kV transmission and transformation"project, a standardized family library of overhead transmission lines is established, and a set of algorithms for automatic sorting of insulator strings and automatic generation of overhead lines are developed, which realizes the parametric design of the lines in 3D environment. The whole process is centered on BIM information model database, which solves the problem of information management and interaction in traditional 2D design, and improves the design efficiency and quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Public transportation in Sidenreng Rappang Regency faces various problems that affect the achievement of tax collection effectiveness. One phenomenon that is often encountered in matters relating to the public transportation tax system is the emergence of an unofficial terminal, irregular tax collection processes, lack of motivation and guidance to tax management officers so that they are less professional in their field duties and public transportation facilities and infrastructure are not yet optimal. For this reason, planning for priority strategies is needed to increase local revenue (PAD). The purpose of this study is to design a priority strategy for increasing local revenue (PAD) through public transportation taxes in Sidenreng Rappang Regency. The research method used is a mixed-methods method. Data were collected through observation and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Then the data were analyzed using stakeholder analysis methods and process hierarchy analysis. Stakeholders involved in increasing public transport taxes in Sidenreng Rappang Regency are divided into two groups. The first group is the key players. Key player's group stakeholders must be more actively involved in planning and evaluating policy. The second group is the actors. Stakeholder group can bring risks, so their existence needs to be monitored and managed properly. To optimize the role of stakeholder actors, it is necessary to coordinate with key stakeholder groups in determining policy. The priority scale of the policy in increasing public transport taxes is as follows: 1) optimizing training and education programs in improving the quality of human resources and increasing the dissemination to taxpayers; 2) improve public transportation terminal facilities; 3) evaluating Regional Regulation Number 10 of 2010 concerning tax tariffs; and 4) cooperation between other agencies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Due to frequent line reconstruction in the distribution station area, the lines between adjacent lines in the distribution station area are messy and the paths are illegible, so that it is difficult for power grid companies to obtain accurate line losses and cannot balance the load planning, which is not conducive to the station area. Local refined management and service levels have been improved. In order to solve this problem, many identification technologies for users in distribution network stations have been proposed. However, traditional identification technologies have problems such as low accuracy and poor detection failure. The most important thing is that it is difficult to demodulate and identify signals. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses an improved differential cross-correlation algorithm to demodulate and identify the signal, and the power communication technology that carries information by artificially generating small distortions of the grid voltage and current. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper. Sex and effectiveness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={One of the principal difficulties faced in developing countries is poor water quality. Approximately 90% households and industrial wastes are discharged untreated properly, directly into the ground and surface water. This research aims to analyze the use of artificial intelligence as a decision support system (DSS) to monitor and determine policies for controlling river pollution from industrial sectors. This study uses an interpretive approach or a qualitative approach by implementing the library research method. Integrated river basin management involves all management issues associated with the supply, use, rehabilitation, protection, pollution, and many others in a river basin. In the decision-making process, it considers the relations between the abiotic and the biotic part of the various water systems, between the ecological and economic factors, and between the various stakeholder interests. The use of technology by policymakers is important to address these water quality-related challenges. Therefore, DSS as an artificial intelligence tool is required to carry out river basin management processes. Thus, water managers can make policies and decisions on the implementation of measures to improve the quality of surface water in the river faster and more precise. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Stormwater pollutants are one of the main problems causing environmental damage. The accumulated pollutants on urban impervious surfaces are carried by stormwater runoff and enter water bodies, therefore, caused ecological damage. To decrease the pollution effect of stormwater, best management practices (BMP), and low-impact development (LID) principles were introduced. Bioretention technology as one of these practices has been used to control stormwater quality. This technology stills not widely used in Malaysia. However, the design of bioretention system that used in Malaysia follows a conventional design and stills in the early stage. Therefore, this paper reviews the role of plants and their effect on bioretention performance in terms of nutrient removal. Bioretention system that vegetated with the plant was very effective on nutrient removal than without plant. In Malaysia, there is a need to develop the conventional bioretention system. Applying multispecies plant in bioretention system would be more effective on nutrient removal. However, limited studies have been conducted on the types of plant that are suggested in (MSMA). This paper recommends applying multispecies plant (mixture plants) to enhance the performance of conventional bioretention system in terms of nutrient removal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the slogans and concepts of sustainable campus, eco-campus, and environmental protection campus have been continually put forward, but there is little ink about the maintenance and management of the most important plants on campus. However, landscape designers often neglect the requirements of plants for the growth conditions of sunlight, or the impact of surrounding buildings on the living environment of plants, resulting in an irreversible situation. To this end, this research hopes to use environmental analysis aided design software to simulate the solar radiation environment and provide references for campus planting design and suggestions for plant selection. The results show that sciophytes are suitable for planting in areas where solar radiation energy is less than 2.90 MJ/m2d; Heliophytes are suitable for planting in areas where solar radiation energy is greater than 5.40 MJ/m2d, and the area in between is suitable for planting mesophytes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The excessive use of pesticides is a problem in vegetable production in Indonesia including in hot pepper chili cultivation. According to this condition, an experiment was conducted in Bocek village Karangploso district Malang Regency from May to November 2019. The study was arranged in a randomized block design with four treatments and five replications. The introduced treatment was the improvement of the integrated plant and resources management (IPRM) component technology i.e. seedling immunization with Amaranthus spinosus liquid extract as an inducer and the use of BaPf as a PGPR and biological control that compared to the farmer technology (existing). The result showed that the introduced technology treatment (seedling immunization + BaPf) gave a higher plant posture than the other treatments. The highest fresh fruit weight was obtained in this treatment. This treatment also produced the highest yield of about 0.81 kg plant-1 or 21.48 tonnes ha-1 or the highest 19,84 % than existing. The intensity of yellow virus and anthracnose diseases in the introduced treatment was lower than existing. Farming analyses showed that this treatment (B) resulted in a higher profit of about Rp 18,214,870/1000 m2 with a 1,51 of B/C ratio. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This study aims to determine visitors' perceptions of several technological innovations implemented. The data presented are in the form of park arrangement, various technological innovations, number of visitors, perceptions of visitors, and apprentices in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The Agro Innovation Park is located in Sungai Tiga IP2TP office area, Pondok Meja Village, Mestong District, Muaro Jambi Regency, Jambi Province. This park was built in 2015, having several types of plants with various adaptive and innovative technologies, ranging from short-lived plants such as leaf-producing vegetables, medium-aged plants such as fruit-producing vegetables, and long-lived plants such as perennials, and also equipped with medicinal plants. There was an increase in the number of visitors and internship students from 2018 to 2019, but there was a decline afterward. This happened due to the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in the temporary closure of parks for visitors and apprentices. The findings indicate that In terms of the service provided, 20% of the visitors were satisfied and 80% said that they were very satisfied. For the various technological innovations implemented, 88% of the visitors stated that they were very interested in park management and 75% were very interested in hydroponic technology innovations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Rice is an important food crop commodity and a priority of the agriculture program in Riau Province. In Siak Regency, the total production of irrigated land rice in 2018 was 21,937.02 t Milled Dry Grain (MDG) with average productivity of 5.47 tons/ha of Harvested Dry Grain (HDG). In general, the productivity of irrigated land rice in Siak Regency is quite high, with varies between locations (4.68-6.60 tons/ha HDG). The purpose of this study was to determine the production of Logawa, Ciherang and Inpari 42 varieties on the application of ICM for irrigated land rice in Siak Regency, Riau Province According to the results of research on irrigated land rice production of new superior varieties (Logawa, Ciherang and Inpari 42) in integrated crop management (ICM) obtained an average production of 8.50 tons/ha HDG. Low productivity of rice is caused by (i) the use of inferior quality varieties, (ii) the use of fertilisers that are not following the recommendations, and (iii) the location-specific technology has not been applied yet. Increasing rice production and productivity can be carried out by using new superior varieties within ICM. The results showed that the application of new superior varieties within ICM resulted in higher HDG production (8.25 - 8.90 tons/ha) compared to non-ICM (6.20 - 6.50 tons/ha). The increase of HDG production are ranging from 2.05 - 2.40 tons/ha (33 - 37%) compared to non-ICM. The application of new superior varieties within ICM increasing profit of Rp 21,963,750 - 24,609,000 (30 - 33%) each planting season/ha. The total costs incurred by ICM farmers for one planting season are Rp. 15,161,250 - Rp. 15,441,000/ha with an income of Rp. 37,125,000 - Rp. 40,050,000/ha/season and RCR value of 2.45-2.59 and BCR of 1, 23 - 2.59. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The development of information and data communication technology field in the world has now increasingly led to the development of the Internet of Things devices. The development of network technology in an organization/university has triggered the need for a system that can monitor computer networks and their devices in an organization/university environment that is quite extensive and complex. At this time, network monitoring becomes quite difficult to do if the computer network in a corporate environment has become very broad and complex. The wider the network and the complex network and multimedia topology that is built, the more difficult it is for network administrators to monitor the network. However, in its application to build a monitoring system it will require devices and hardware and computer requirements and specifications that are above average, which of course will also require substantial costs and large resources as well. In this research, a network monitoring and bandwidth management system will be built by using Raspberry-Pi and Icinga as the main modules in network management. Raspberry Pi is an alternative of computers that has many capabilities and has a high ability which is generally used as a Mini-Server at a very cheap price when compared with existing servers. And Icinga is an open source-based application platform that functions to monitor various types of variables contained in servers and infrastructure of the network such as availability and performance and provides easy access for network administrators to important data and to improve maintenance of network conditions. So, it is hoped that by applying this, a good and optimal network monitoring and bandwidth management tool can be produced at a low cost. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has encouraged the beginning of a new form of hospitality business known as a Virtual Hotel Operator (VHO). This hotel concept in recent years succeeded in attracting hotel management and cooperation from various accommodation entrepreneurs. VHO concept is considered a disruption that threatens the existing hotels. Some of the big VHO brands in Bandung include RedDoorz and Oyo. The presence of VHO might be one of the reasons for the decrease in the occupancy rate of star hotels. The other hand, the occupancy of non-star hotels continues to increase. It becomes urgent to understand the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of the VHO. This study aims to identify the determinants of the success of VHO hotels in Bandung. This research is an exploratory study using primary data through surveys, and secondary data that focuses on hotel guests who have stayed through VHO in Bandung City CSFs are measured using questionnaire using the Likert scale of 5 and processed using SPSS 25. The findings of this study indicate that the choose VHOs is inspired by the variety of promotions offered, ease of access, and extensive hotel networks. Furthermore, the factors that support the success of VHO are components of service quality, core products and control strategies. The ease of booking a room and broadness of the network are keys in increasing VHO sales. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Indonesian government continues to ensure the availability of rice as a staple food through various programs, including optimization of paddy fields. Paddy field management is directed and encouraged more intensively by accelerating planting and minimizing idle land. The form of support and stimulation provided by the government to farmers is in the form of counseling and assistance, providing seed assistance, and facilitation of agricultural machinery and other facilities so that rice fields can be more intensive and productive. The study was conducted in Lebak Regency and Serang City, Banten Province from April to August 2020. Data and information were obtained through surveys and interviews with farmers, extension agents, researchers, and agricultural department officials. The research method used a systems approach based on soft systems methodology. The results of the study showed the acceleration of planting as an indicator of the optimization of wetland land in Lebak Regency and Serang City had been achieved as targeted. The role of the extension agents as a driving force was very decisive in the achievement of additional planting areas. The use of information technology, such as applications for monitoring standing crops, was very helpful for extension agents in detecting land to be planted, planting achievements, and reported data. The system of coordination and guidance between agencies and officers to accelerate planting was quite effective and efficient. Support and facilities for agricultural extension agents had to be improved to achieve accelerated planting performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={There are many issues affecting the human resources in organizations today. The volatility in the global economy has brought about many changes and the human resources are the most affected. They have to learn to adapt to these changes and cope with the daily pressures. No industry is spared as change is seen as the only constant. This research attempts to ascertain stressors from the perception of nurses at a private hospital in Malaysia. It investigates issues pertaining to their workload, work environment, social support, and manpower. Random sampling determined the sample size from the population frame provided by the hospital’s human resource department. Of the 108 nurses selected as respondents only 80 questionnaires were usable. The use of close-ended questionnaires using nominal and interval scales extracted information from the respondents. The data was then analyzed using the SmartPLS 3.3.2. Findings show that workload and manpower availability are stressors among the nurses. The management of the hospitals need to look into these two issues to help overcome the stress faced by the nurses. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ten sub-districts in Jombang, Indonesia, namely jombang downtown, Bareng, Wonosalam, Mojoagung, Mojowarno, Ploso,Kudu, Bandarkedungmulyo, Sumobito dan kesamben experience the impact of natural disasters of floods and landslides each year. All of these sub-districts consists of 32 villages. Disasters that become an annual routine, namely floods and landslides, make residents suffer moral and material losses. The Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) is the main actor in helping this disaster such as donors who want to help the victims of natural disasters is accommodated by BPBD with the aim of equitable distribution of aid and on target. However, the practice in the field encountered obstacles namely not finding the shortest track from the location of the natural disaster to be visited in accordance with the track and logistics needs at the disaster site. The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used by researchers to solve the problems encountered by Jombang BPBD. There are 6 iterations in implementing this algorithm. ACO algorithm test outcomes to find the track in the distribution of logistics to the disaster location that obtained the value of the number of ants 10, the initial pheromone of 0.117 from C greedy obtained 85,5 and the distance obtained from the google map. With the ACO algorithm found 3 alternatives for logistics distribution tracks in natural disaster areas in Jombang. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Knowledge management systems can help to automate KM processes that exist in organizations. These systems facilitate knowledge discovery, knowledge capture, knowledge sharing, and applying knowledge in an organization. Using appropriate methods to develop and implementing knowledge management systems help organizations realizing these systems more effectively to enhance an organization's competitive advantage and facilitate KM processes. This study investigates the approach for developing knowledge management systems in organizations with a systematic literature review in the past ten years. The findings in the literature study show that seventeen methods are used in the development of KMS, where the SECI knowledge spiral is the most often method used for developing KMS by combining it with traditional IS development techniques. In this study, we also compare five methods as candidates for KMS development methods that can support the acceleration of the innovation process in organizations and evaluate them based on KM criteria that support innovation using the analytic hierarchy process technique. It is found that Fernandez's methodology combines with Joint Application Design (JAD) adoption is the most prominent method used in building a knowledge management system to support the innovation process in an organization and web 2.0 as the most technology applied to support organizational KM implementation. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) survey in 2018 showed that only 1.2% of households recycle waste and around 66.8% incinerate waste. Low community participation has a negative impact on landfill dependence, managing-cost, sustainable waste management, and the environment. This study aims to optimize community-based household and hazardous waste management at the local government level. This research used policy analysis, field surveys, and in-depth interviews regarding the issuance of Jakstrada. However, Jakstrada is not necessarily the answer to the waste problem. This is in accordance with the target to be achieved from the preparation of the Jakstrada, whereby in 2025 the national waste problem is 100% managed, with no more waste being dumped into the river or open burning in the environment. Waste is encouraged to be managed by applying the 3R (reduce-reuse-recycle) principle, with the key strategy by changing the community's paradigm to build awareness in managing their waste. As the hierarchy of sustainable waste management emphasizes the importance of public participation and changes their perception of waste management as the first step to achieve waste reduction, support for reliable technology is also needed to recycle and reuse waste. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study seeks to analyze the antecedent factors of digital knowledge sharing that affect innovation work behavior and organizational innovation capability of employees working in government organizations. This study identifies four antecedents of digital knowledge sharing, namely demographics, environment, individuals, and organizations that have an influence on innovation work behavior and organizational innovation capability through indicators of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting from digital knowledge sharing. The online survey method was used to collect data from respondents, a number of 1000 employees of the Secretariat General, Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia. The data analysis of this study used Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with the SmartPLS 3.2.9 application. The results showed that the four antecedents of digital knowledge sharing had a significant effect on innovation work behavior and organizational innovation capability through indicators of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting from digital knowledge sharing. In addition, it was also found that the knowledge donating indicator was a better contributor in facilitating innovation work behavior and organizational innovation capability of government employees compared to knowledge collecting indicators. This study also lead the digital knowledge sharing, innovation works behavior, and organizational innovation capacity into a part of sustainability development goals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Fish demand has been steadily increasing globally. Due to stabilization of harvest from capture fisheries the aquaculture has grown rapidly at the rate of 7.5-9.2 annually. Currently, the contribution of this sector to the global seafood supply has exceeded the landings from the sea. A review of fish production and consumption scenario was carried out in a systems approach that envisaged case-based reasoning for the synthesis of new knowledge. This enabled the identification of ways and means of applying modern technologies to the existing aquaculture production methods. How the aquaculture systems can be transformed by such interventions to further enhance its contribution to food security which is at the heart of all the Sustainable Development Goals has been elaborated. Technology access and adoption, workforce transformation, and adjusting to the global value chains are the issues that have to be addressed. In this context, research and development institutions can help by leveraging their resources and expertise in motivating a review of the existing policies and knowledge transfer to the farming communities to shape the development of aquaculture along the sustainability pathways. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Catfish is currently the flagship commodity to increase economic value in Indonesia. Catfish farming is very profitable because good broodstock maintenance will produce quality tillers. A good catfish broodstock should have a feed management system, thereby improving the quality of mains. The purpose is to learn about feed management technology (life and pellet feed) on the maintenance of Mutiara catfish (Clarias sp.). The method is with a descriptive method with immediate data retrieval and secondary data. Life feed is observed by taking water samples and then observed using a microscope. Life feed that is found using a microscope is Spirulina sp. and Chlorella sp. Feed management on the maintenance of the broodstock of the Mutiara catfish (Clarias sp.) is by feeding one time a day at a dose of 1.5 kg, the feed used is pellets PL 1 size 2 mm which has 33% protein and 5% fat, FCR which can be 2.43, absolute growth 15.42 kg, SGR 0.147 %, GR 2.4 gram/day, and SR 100%. Fish enlargement is a business activity maintenance fish up to the size of consumption. The feed is the largest component on the business of catfish enlargement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Striped catfish (P. hypophthalmus) is a high economic value and is a determining factor at the hatchery stage. Quality catfish brooders that can produce superior seeds can be obtained through good handling. The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge in the maintenance techniques of catfish broodstock. The working methods used in the study is a descriptive method with primary and secondary data collection. Striped catfish broodstock uses a recirculation system which includes preparation of pond maintenance, broodstock maintenance, feed management, water quality management, broodstock selection, and spawning. The results of the average water quality parameters for 25 days are turbidity 17.85 cm, temperature 29.51°C, DO 4.23 mg/L, ammonium 0.005 mg/L, and pH 7.54. The average weight measurements in the first and second sampling are 3.11 kg and 3.13 kg, while the average length measurements in the first and second sampling are 55 cm and 56.05 cm. The growth rate in the maintenance of catfish broodstock for 21 days is 9.52 grams/day, and the specific growth rate is 0.028%. Catfish spawning uses a ratio of ten males and three females. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The fund management and investment campaign will become a moral hazard to educational institutions as a center of knowledge and culture if it does not involve the community. Using the Smart Behavior Social Intervention Method in Taruma Jaya Village, Kertasari, Bandung Regency, socialize the skills development pattern and identify Laku Pandai's banking partners' income sources. This paper aims to increase product diversification in Laku Pandai associated with the potential for sustainable financial inclusion in the village of Taruma Jaya. Innovation and product alignment with 109 respondents collected and filled out questionnaires consists of the university, industry, government relations, innovation and production processes. The mechanism of interaction between Laku Pandai and the five variables has had a positive impact on the improvement of output at a significant level of 0.05 and the university has the lowest significance compared with other variables. The results show the potential benefits for Laku Pandai when collaboration can boost their products' performance and enable people around Citarum, in particular Kilometer 0 Area, to find job diversification initiated from support for branchless banking to start up business with access to finance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Oil palm is a very common commodity in rural communities of Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia, and the farming activities in these areas create a high multiplier effect and increase welfare. However, the expansion of oil palm areas puts pressure on forests and resources. The research was carried out through a survey using the developmental research method. Efforts to implement sustainable development in the plantation sector need to be carried out to develop palm in the second cycle. One of the efforts is to implement agroforestry by planting forestry plants between oil palm trees, namely meranti trees (Shorea leprosula Miq). The model for the development of meranti is a monoculture palm plantation that is integrated with meranti trees. This has ecological, economic, and social benefits, following the basic concepts of environmental management. Planting copper meranti between palm trees has multiple benefits for the community, such as wood production. Planting copper meranti between oil palm trees has multiple benefits for the community, timber production as additional income for farmer families. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Organic waste can have economic value, such as used for animal feed, fish, and fertilizer. Organic waste from human activities needs to be deciphered before it becomes an economically valuable product. Maggots (BSF flies) are larvae that can convert organic material into biomass and potentially break down organic waste. Garbage has become a problem in Jambi due to population growth, changes in consumption patterns, and people's lifestyles, producing 1,600 m3 of waste per day. By utilizing maggot cultivation (BSF), community services activities can enhance the economic value of organic waste in Purwodadi Village, Tanjung Jabung Barat Regency, Jambi. This article aims to study organic waste management using maggot cultivation. The result is that this method can be an alternative for organic waste management. This method embarks a sustainable environment and increases resources which can be traded or utilized. Maggot bioconversion technology can deal with three main problems, namely: The generation of organic waste, high prices of protein sources, and increasing demand for animal feed. In conclusion, organic waste management using maggot cultivation brings a sustainable environment and enhances organic waste's economic value. Therefore, it can be a useful alternative for waste management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A plant factory with artificial light is an effective system producing food to satisfy specific demands on yield, morphology, taste and nutrient accumulation in plants. All environmental factors inside a plant factory can be controlled without climate and location limitation. Light is one of the most important factors affecting plant growth and quality. By regulating light aspects, such as light intensity, light period, light quality, lighting position, and daily light integral, the growth and quality of the plants grown in a plant factory can be largely enhanced. As known, the initial and operating cost for a plant factory with artificial light is high, particularly the cost of electrical energy related to lighting. Identifying the optimal light environment that promotes plant growth and quality is critical for commercialization of plant factories. Recent researches have paid great attentions to the effects of light environment on the growth and morphology of leafy vegetables. On the other hand, the demand on functional plants that contain high concentration of bioactive compounds is increasing rapidly. Bioactive compounds in plants have been intensively studied to evaluate their effects on human health and many of them are proved to be clinically active against various types of diseases (e.g. anti-cancer effects). More and more people prefer to take health product derived from natural plants for disease prevention. Solutions to realize sustainable production of high quality functional/medicinal plants can be provided by developing environmental control technologies, such as light recipe, in plant factories. Aromatic herbs such as coriander; medicinal plants such as perilla and water spinach are subjected to different light conditions and root zone environments. Some bioactive compounds e.g. perillaldehyde and rosmarinic acid in perilla leaves; phenolic compounds and flavonoids, especially rutin and chlorogenic acid in coriander can be enhanced. The effects of each light aspect on plant growth vary with plant species and other environmental conditions, however, there are also some general trends that can be used to guide commercial application. This presentation introduces the basic of light and its effects on plant growth in plant factories, demonstrates research results that have been published in scientific journals, reports the current study on herbs and medicinal plants, and summarizes the general application of light in plant production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Russia has revived its vitiviniculture in the beginning of XXI century. Without the burden of old regulation and established reputation the modern technologies including digital technologies could be expected to prosper here. To certain extent it happened and Russian academics and innovators have offered some digital solutions for the wine makers related to the mapping of the vineyards and crop. Still predominantly, the digital technologies in Russia are designed for the control and surveillance. The legislation on viticulture and wine making and its social environment push the technology development toward the vigilance and control of the final product rather than towards the transformation of vineyards management. The renaissance of the viticulture in Russia opens unique opportunity to make Russian vitiviniculture modern and advanced sector of economy. However, this innovative potential is still left unexploited. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In Russia, much attention is paid to the development of the digital economy and artificial intelligence technologies. Agricultural organizations need artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence creates new opportunities for substantiating management decisions, including in the field of management accounting. The aim of the study is to develop directions for using artificial intelligence in the management accounting of agricultural organizations. The methodology of management accounting has been supplemented with new provisions that show the use of artificial intelligence in the management system of agricultural organizations. Interpretations of the elements of the management accounting methodology are proposed: the object (historical, current and prospective information on the costs and results of financial and economic activities in different sections and details), the subject (financial and production activities of agricultural organizations and their structural elements), methods (general and specific). It is proposed to expand the statement of the goal of management accounting (strengthening the efficiency, reliability and completeness of information provided to management) and tasks (identification and measurement of activity parameters; increasing the efficiency of information collection; operational preparation and processing of information with a given degree of detail and depth of time lag; strengthening the quality of management analysis, control, planning and forecasting). It is proposed to supplement the methodological characteristics of the principles and functions of management accounting with new analytical and organizational capabilities. It is concluded that artificial intelligence can become an applied management accounting tool, expanding its traditional capabilities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The spatial heterogeneity of Russian territories has among other differences (like the climatic, resource) also an association with interregional and intraregional differentiation. The development of the agro-industrial complex (AIC) along with other industries will contribute to smoothing these differences and improving inter-level interaction. They can become catalysts for spatial development by introducing new technological processes in the agro-industrial complex, improving regional and municipal infrastructure, and digitalizing the regional economy. Due to the introduction of informative-communicative technology the production of regional economic entities is developing, a bigger increase in the gross regional product is provided. The thesis formulates that the digitalization of the regional agro-industrial complex contributes to the solution of the transformation issues in industrial and social relations that affect the further development of the agro-industrial complexes due to the implementation of new methodological and practical approaches in regional management of different territories. Monitoring tools, resource forecasting analysis allow bringing regional agribusiness and related industries to a new progressive level of development, which regional financial interests, systematized into homogeneous groups, allow solving many issues of the spatial development of regions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Delimiting the scope and boundary of river and lake management is the primary work of strengthening river and lake management, and is the precondition of water conservancy administration according to law. The precise scope of management and protection areas is defined for the purpose of regulating all activities within the area and carrying out water conservation activities within the area. The conventional surveying and mapping technology of acquiring terrain data, i.e., Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawing of river construction projects, mapping of 1:2 000 scale image, are not only time-consuming but also inaccurate. The high-resolution 3D point cloud data obtained from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) lidar can identify the baseline lines of river management demarcation, i.e.,ank toe line, dike toe line, bank revetment top line, bank slope line, etc. Through spatial analysis and manual visual interpretation, the boundary of river management area can be accurately demarcated. The accuracy of the baseline lines of river management demarcation drawn by ARCGIS depends on the resolution of 3D point cloud data, the environment of the river and the deviation of manual visual interpretation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The landforms and geological structures in Shandong Province are relatively complex, and the complex topographical conditions and geological structures have caused a series of geological problems. This article outlines the main types of geological disasters in Shandong Province through literature research and geological survey, summarizes the distribution characteristics and causes of different types of geological disasters in Shandong Province, describes the prevention and control status of various geological disasters, and proposes future research recommendations on geological disaster management. Through the analysis and data compilation of a large number of geological disaster cases in Shandong Province, the research results show that the hidden dangers of geological disasters in Shandong Province are mainly subsidence, landslides, debris flows and ground subsidence, which are mainly distributed in the eastern, southern and central parts of Shandong Province. Its development law is closely related to the topography, stratum lithology, and geological structure, engineering geological characteristics, hydrogeological characteristics and human-made engineering activities of the study area. Existing geological disaster control measures focus on eliminating hidden dangers, but the results of environmental management are few. Therefore, in the future, efforts should be made to research on geological disaster prevention and control engineering based on ecological protection and form ecological management that combines management engineering with natural and human engineering technology. This article aims to systematically introduce the major geological disasters and their distribution characteristics in Shandong Province, make up for the lack of existing research results, and provide a scientific basis for future research on geological disasters. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={To improve the accuracy and reduce the disturbance during the monitoring, the index system and the mathematic model of optimal wind speed sensors' location are established using the variable fuzzy theory. Then the adjustment analysis of redundant wind speed sensor measurement and the standard deviation filter method are put forward. Then, the dynamic monitoring technology in mine ventilation network is formed and the automatic monitoring system of air quantity in mine ventilation network is established. The application in a complex ventilation network shows that, this method only needs 10 wind speed sensors (7 must install points and 3 redundant install points) to obtain the air quantity of 19 branches. And it can achieve the dynamic monitoring in the underground roadway, which provides an important basic data for management decisions in mine ventilation network. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In order to clarify the response of soil enzyme activities of cultivated salinealkali soil to sand cover in the Loess Plateau-Mu Us Sandy ecotone. In this study, the soil enzyme activities of the saline-alkali soils before and after sand-covering (CK) and after sand-covering for three consecutive years were taken as the research objects. The results showed that the activities of four soil enzymes (urease, catalase, protease, and alkaline phosphatase) all increased to varying degrees after covering with sand. Among them, the effect of covering with sand on soil urease and alkaline phosphatase was significant. In general, the activities of the four soil enzymes are negatively correlated with soil physical properties (except porosity) and positively correlated with soil chemical properties. This study provides data support for revealing the long-term effects of sand-covering on soil enzyme activities of cultivated saline-alkali soils, and provides a reasonable idea and theoretical reference for the feasibility of using sand-covered soil organic restructuring technology in saline-alkali soil management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the continuous progress of society, the continuous development of economy and the acceleration of urbanization, the construction industry has also developed vigorously. In the civil building foundation structure, it is inseparable from the use of mass concrete. Only by ensuring that the structural strength, crack resistance and bearing capacity of mass concrete meet the requirements, can we improve the quality of civil engineering buildings. The construction technology of mass concrete structure in civil engineering buildings is analyzed. The society has put forward more and more stringent requirements for the construction technology of civil engineering, and civil engineering construction technology is the core technology in engineering construction. In recent years, although civil engineering construction technology has developed rapidly and achieved certain achievements and results, most of the technologies are imported or referenced by western technologies, which are lack of innovation, and some of them are relatively backward, wasting a lot of manpower, material and financial resources, resulting in waste of resources, unqualified construction quality and other phenomena. Therefore, in order to better apply civil engineering and improve its construction effect and quality, it is necessary to innovate the construction technology. In the actual construction process, it is necessary to innovate the civil engineering construction technology, so that the engineering construction industry can improve productivity and meet the needs of the development of social construction. Promote the good development of society. This paper will discuss and study the civil engineering construction technology, in order to improve the building quality and economic benefits of the construction industry, and bring some enlightenment to the innovation of civil engineering construction technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Steel structure with its high strength, light weight, good seismic performance, high degree of industrialization, short construction period, strong plasticity, energy conservation and environmental protection and other comprehensive advantages, has been widely used in machinery, construction and many other fields. But because of its huge scale, increasingly complex structure, project management is facing many problems. Based on the multi-user mode of steel structure in-depth design, the technology of product modelling, structural analysis, in-depth design, engineering calculation, processing and manufacturing and cost control are studied, especially the advantages in model creation and component manufacturing bring more possibilities for the mechanical industry. Based on the multi-user mode, the steel structure deepening design technology integrates the technical requirements of the project, provides clear information for the owner, designer, raw material supplier, manufacturer, construction party, etc., promotes the implementation of the project, improves the achievement degree of the project, and improves the control ability of the engineering personnel. A number of foreign large-scale bulk material conveying systems have obtained good benefits by using the steel structure deepening design technology based on the multiuser mode, which improves the industrialization degree of steel structure component design and manufacturing, so that the research results have good practicability and operability. The research results have positive guiding significance for the practice of steel structure deepening design. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the increasingly prominent problems of water ecology and water environment, regional overall planning and systematic management of water environment is a new mode of water pollution harnessing work under the background of the new era. The effectiveness of water environment governance largely depends on whether the scheme is reasonable or not. Therefore, intuitively reflecting the design results is the first step of water environment comprehensive treatment. At present, the scheme design mode of water environment governance mainly uses CAD to design and renderer to render, which can no longer fully meet the needs of design with a fixed perspective. Based on this, this paper proposes a scheme design method of water environment comprehensive treatment based on UAV tilt photography technology. Firstly, the three-dimensional model of the research area is obtained by UAV tilt photography, and then the scheme is designed based on the three-dimensional model. Finally, the scheme based on the three-dimensional model is compared with the traditional design scheme. The results show that the water environment comprehensive treatment scheme based on oblique photography has more diverse functions. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={At present, traditional campus smart blackboard detection generally uses manual detection as the main method and equipment detection as the auxiliary method to determine the fault information encountered, and it is still limited to relying on the experience of the campus smart blackboard management and maintenance personnel to judge the fault. Solve the problem. In this paper, aiming at the problems of low efficiency of traditional campus blackboard detection technology, high manual detection cost, and low classroom enthusiasm due to untimely detection, this paper proposes a campus intelligent blackboard monitoring system based on AI technology, and establishes a chain-type intelligent classroom education system. Smart classroom does not affect the development of social education level because of some disadvantages brought about by technological development. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Under the new normal, the economic growth model of resource and environment consumption is unsustainable, and improving ecological efficiency has become an inevitable choice for high-quality economic development. Based on this, on the basis of constructing the input-output evaluation system of ecological efficiency at the city scale, this study uses DEA-Malmquist model to calculate the ecological efficiency and its dynamics of 9 cities in Fujian Province from 2009 to 2018. The results show that there are differences in ecological efficiency among different regions in Fujian Province, and the ecological efficiency of Fuzhou, Xiamen and Ningde all reach the best level. The ecological efficiency of inland areas in Fujian Province is obviously lower than that of coastal areas such as Fuzhou and Xiamen, which indicates that the coordination between inland areas and coastal areas should be strengthened. In addition, the coordination degree of regional production management and technological progress in Fujian Province is not high. Therefore, when the governments at all levels of Fujian Province plan the industrial development strategy, they should fully consider the development path suitable for improving the ecological efficiency, and finally realize the development strategy that green water and green mountains are the golden mountains and silver mountains. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Logistics management holds an important role for every company include product procurement, product storage, and product distribution. Rapid technology development is insisting the company to use all of its resources maximally and professionally to support their success. Implementation of logistics management can be seen in the retail company. Design of the logistical management operation model, using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), needs to be done for better implementation. The needs for design are identified by using system request and feasibility analysis that will be able to reduce non-value added time in the order picking process and able to simplify the company's logistics activity. The system entity is analyzed and shows the affecting factors are: input, process, output, objectives, stakeholder, resources, internal control, operating constraint, opportunities, and threats. Then, the conceptual model of the logistics management model is built through the application of value chain analysis and the application of the canvas operating model. At the new warehouse location, a warehouse management system will be implemented and built collaboration with several fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) suppliers. Then Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is used to model logistics business processes, inbound logistics business processes, inventory management business processes, and outbound logistics business processes. The business process model will be used as a reference for the company to carry out its logistics business operation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In a society filled with technology and advancement in the quest for convenience, food production is unlikely to be disregarded as the world continue to find means on securing adequate supply to nourish nations. This study aims to increase production efficiency and profitability of one of the most sought after commodities, mango. A technology demonstration on the application of ICM in the nine (9) community- based model farms was established. As a result of the adopted technology innovations demonstrated by mango farmers in their respective mango farms, the study revealed significant findings on the increase in yield and income by 440% and 586.65%, respectively, after ICM application. It is therefore recommended that the system be institutionalized by LGUs, and appropriate policies be implemented to further provide assistance to small players that comprised the mango industry in the country. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Energy is a multiplying factor which allows man to translate various raw material and resources into useful items to meet the daily demands and necessities of human beings. Foundry technology involved casting from molten metal transferred into a mould and permitted to harden under varying conditions depending on the purpose. This paper reviews the foundry industry as an energy exhaustive industry, in the sense that it requires energy in various forms such as electrical, heat and mechanical to carry out various engineering processes to deliver the appropriate casting required. It also reviews the different methods are currently being employed to make the manufacturing process more efficient and each of them have led to an increase in energy demand. It is affirmed that the new methods involved in foundry and their energy management policy can led to more efficient energy consumption for casted product. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Pervious pavement is a special type of pavement with a high porosity used to reduce surface runoff and to recharge underground aquifer. It could also be used to trap solids and keep pollutants from contaminating the water stream. This review of literature examines existing studies methodologies, technologies, advantages and drawbacks on the use of pervious pavement for stormwater control and aquifer recharge. The result of the review revealed that cement content, water-cement ratio and compaction level affect the mechanical strength of pervious concrete in rigid pavement construction. Due to the complex nature pervious properties of this concrete. Pervious concrete requires stricter quality control of the concrete mixture proportioning as compared with the conventional concrete as there are no standard specification for testing. Surface sweeping method of pore-clogging removal was ineffective in the improvement of the hydraulic conductivity of pervious pavements, as it can only help in the removal of surface debris and not sediments removal from deep voids. The development of this pavement is a positive way forward for stormwater management and aquifer recharge.

abstract={The emergence of new technologies, such as blockchain, Big Data, etc., provides fundamentally new opportunities for the formation of distributed databases necessary for assessing and managing hydrological risks in urbanized areas. At the same time, the use of the most modern technologies is based on adequate modeling and forecasting of hydrological processes, which, in the context of climatic changes and poorly predicted meteorological events for the long term, require close attention and understanding. The article deals with the tasks of risk assessment and prevention of damage from hazardous hydrological processes (rainfall floods, floods, mudflows, etc.) in framework of the Smart City Concept. Natural and anthropogenic factors of floods, methods of risk assessment and risk management in flooded areas are discussed. The issues of hazardous hydrological processes predictability and damage assessment are discussed. Sufficiency and effectiveness of the decisions made in the field of minimizing the negative impact of water, sufficiency of forces and means to ensure population safety and economic facilities are assessed on the example of the Kuban River basin. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Financial Services Industry (FSI) is a sector with day-to-day business transaction operation dealing with numbers of classified information owned by its customers. It can be managed by the private sector or other institutions pointed by the government, either it is a bank or an insurance company. Aiming to improve services, acquisitions between companies can occur. There will be a migration of applications and databases in the acquisition process. This process will present certain constraints and challenges and prone to data fraud. Improper handling will also have a negative impact on the environment, especially e-waste generation of IT components from financial sector due to company's acquisition case. So, study on database and application migration is important to be conducted. This research aims to identify constraints and challenge factors behind application and database migration in the FSI during a company acquisition. It uses a descriptive qualitative method with a case study approach that examines as much data as possible regarding the subject under study. The case studies use a single-case method, considering that the cases studied are unique and essential. The migration methodology used in this study combines application migration and databases from previous research journals and is added to the processes that occur in the field. Two factors become obstacles and challenges in the migration process, namely technology and non-technological factors. Database migration strategy uses a big-bang strategy based on joint decisions between the business and IT teams. The organizational challenge is the approval process for the transfer of membership management and data conditions that require validation and confirmation before migration. This research suggests using a mature migration strategy to anticipate technical and organizational constraints applying clear and scheduled policies and regulations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Smart Micro Grid in household areas aims to meet electricity needs through the integration between state power plant with renewable energy sources so that the electricity used does not depend entirely on state utility. Smart Micro Grid also enables the availability of energy management services supported by Machine Learning (ML) technology, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensors so that consumer use of electricity is more efficient. To improve energy management services and distribution of renewable energy sources, new innovations in ML technology are needed to produce accurate learning models that can be used in the energy analysis process, such as monitoring, prediction, forecasting, scheduling and decision-making. However, the complexity of the problems in the smart grid system, which includes uncertainty and non-linearity, affects the more complex the energy data structure generated. Therefore, the simple ML method will not be able to perform the Learning process because it is limited to simple raw data processing. Therefore, the Deep Learning (DL) method can be used as a Learning method on data that has a complex and large structure. In this paper, Deep Neural Network (DNN) method will be developed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as a Learning model to provide Future Accurate Prediction (FAP) on electricity use and on renewable energy plants.

abstract={The rapid growth of population in urban areas resulted in a higher amount of waste generated yearly. According to the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp), in 2018, Malaysians generated 38, 142 tonnes of waste per day with an average of 0.83 kg/capita/day for a household in the urban area. Malaysia, with a population of 32.4 million, 76% of the entire population are living in urban areas (Department of Statistic, 2018), this figure is worrying. This pilot study explores and evaluates the perspectives of governance on waste management processes and practices for urban residents; in a mixed density housing scheme. A survey was conducted on 30 respondents of a mixed density housing scheme in Section 7, Shah Alam, Selangor. The data then analysed through reliability test analysis. There were four (4) key variables being put forward for this study; services and practices, socio-economic and well-being, stakeholders and environment. The result of the analysis has found out that, the variables for waste management services for mixed density housing scheme are reliable with the respondent's feedback. However, some questions are not compatible to be analysed in parallel with other questions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Environmental sustainability practices in facilities management (FM) are vital in reducing the impact of buildings on the natural environment, and such practices can provide a significant contribution to university achievement in terms of reducing cost, improving efficiency, and expanding the value of an investment. The present investigation deals with environmental sustainability practices that are concerned with climate change, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and resource consumption. The aim is to determine the extent of environmental sustainability adoption in FM practices for Malaysian universities. An online questionnaire survey was undertaken to key practitioners in the FM office who have essential roles in sustainability implementation. The questionnaires were administered to 18 public universities with a total invitation of 88 participants and 65% response rate. Generally, universities in Malaysia showed some commitment in FM practice towards environmental sustainability with some focused-on programs of emission control (3.94), water conservation (3.81), biodiversity preservation (3.79), and energy efficiency (3.71) programs. Specifically, in the three FM phases, namely, in operation and maintenance, in renovation and refurbishment and demolition and rebuild works, the results showed no significant differences. Indeed, environmental sustainability is equally adopted in whole FM phases for Malaysian universities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid growth of population in urban areas resulted in a higher amount of waste generated yearly. According to the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp), in 2018, Malaysians generated 38, 142 tonnes of waste per day with an average of 0.83 kg/capita/day for a household in the urban area. Malaysia, with a population of 32.4 million, 76% of the entire population are living in urban areas (Department of Statistic, 2018), this figure is worrying. This pilot study explores and evaluates the perspectives of governance on waste management processes and practices for urban residents; in a mixed density housing scheme. A survey was conducted on 30 respondents of a mixed density housing scheme in Section 7, Shah Alam, Selangor. The data then analysed through reliability test analysis. There were four (4) key variables being put forward for this study; services and practices, socio-economic and well-being, stakeholders and environment. The result of the analysis has found out that, the variables for waste management services for mixed density housing scheme are reliable with the respondent's feedback. However, some questions are not compatible to be analysed in parallel with other questions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study aims to identify the determinants of key forces in the external and internal environment of event management to propose a sustainable environment analysis framework that will help organizers to improve the sustainability of the strategy formulation. The proposed framework incorporates sustainability practices, previous research on sustainable event management, existing strategies of sustainable strategic management, and the results from this study. This framework has adopted PEST Analysis (a framework used to analyse and monitor macro-environmental factors that may have a profound impact on an organization's performance) in external environment analysis and Mckinsey 7s Framework in internal environment analysis to identify sustainable-related determinants of key forces to propose common sustainable practices to get common acceptance for sustainability. The identified determinants were applied in the proposed framework to guide event organizer when identifying key forces of external and internal environment which can influence to achieve sustainability in the event. On top of this, SWOT Analysis (a strategic planning technique used to help an organization to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threat related to business competition) was adopted to help event organizers to identify the opportunities and threats in the external environment and understand the strengths and weakness of the organization to formulate effective sustainable strategies and move their events toward sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The Kuala Keniam Research Station in Taman Negara has experienced severe damages to large flood and therefore this station spatial visualization and database management need to be enhanced appropriately. A meticulous park information system is required for assisting staff and users to manage the spatial park entities in an identifiable ecotourism mapping. This pilot study was proposed to develop a 3D GIS visualisation for the park and landscape management using software development life cycle (SDLC) and several 3D software. Findings from the local user requirements showed that 100% agreed for developing an interactive 3D mapping in the study area. The developed mapping has demonstrated its capabilities in modelling 3D park mapping and constructing a geopark database such as updating functions of park's attributes, park animation and visualisation, and other basic functions of a common park system. An experienced staff from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (PERHILITAN) has been also interviewed with a testing form to evaluate the mapping's capabilities and this evaluator was satisfied with all elements and functions developed in the digital map, but the interactivity of the map need to be improved for an advanced geoanalysis of the park. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Serviced apartment as a newly popular type of mixed-use residential area is providing a new lifestyle to people with commercial, recreational facilities, and public transport facilities within the walking distance. The change of living environment from traditional housing area such as terrace houses and apartments to high rise serviced apartment did affect the change of well-being level of people. A study had been carried out in Main Place Serviced Apartment in USJ, Subang Jaya with three components of well-being, i.e. psychological, physical and social well-being. The well-being level among residents was identified through a questionnaire survey. From the analysis, the study found that psychological aspect of well-being was increased after respondents were moved into the study area. However, not all the physical and social elements were increased the satisfaction/well-being levels. Serviced apartment with a mixture of land uses and facilities can be further refined especially on the aspects of parking, traffic condition, social life, and waste management/cleaning services. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study aims to identify the determinants of key forces in the external and internal environment of event management to propose a sustainable environment analysis framework that will help organizers to improve the sustainability of the strategy formulation. The proposed framework incorporates sustainability practices, previous research on sustainable event management, existing strategies of sustainable strategic management, and the results from this study. This framework has adopted PEST Analysis (a framework used to analyse and monitor macro-environmental factors that may have a profound impact on an organization's performance) in external environment analysis and Mckinsey 7s Framework in internal environment analysis to identify sustainable-related determinants of key forces to propose common sustainable practices to get common acceptance for sustainability. The identified determinants were applied in the proposed framework to guide event organizer when identifying key forces of external and internal environment which can influence to achieve sustainability in the event. On top of this, SWOT Analysis (a strategic planning technique used to help an organization to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threat related to business competition) was adopted to help event organizers to identify the opportunities and threats in the external environment and understand the strengths and weakness of the organization to formulate effective sustainable strategies and move their events toward sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid growth of population in urban areas resulted in a higher amount of waste generated yearly. According to the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp), in 2018, Malaysians generated 38, 142 tonnes of waste per day with an average of 0.83 kg/capita/day for a household in the urban area. Malaysia, with a population of 32.4 million, 76% of the entire population are living in urban areas (Department of Statistic, 2018), this figure is worrying. This pilot study explores and evaluates the perspectives of governance on waste management processes and practices for urban residents; in a mixed density housing scheme. A survey was conducted on 30 respondents of a mixed density housing scheme in Section 7, Shah Alam, Selangor. The data then analysed through reliability test analysis. There were four (4) key variables being put forward for this study; services and practices, socio-economic and well-being, stakeholders and environment. The result of the analysis has found out that, the variables for waste management services for mixed density housing scheme are reliable with the respondent's feedback. However, some questions are not compatible to be analysed in parallel with other questions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Using natural gas for fueling a ship growing extensively since environmental issues become one of the priorities in the shipping industry. The ship uses natural gas as the main fuel commonly called as a gas-powered ship. Gas has lower specific prices compare with any type of diesel fuel. But due to handling, storage, and distribution costs then gas prices for ships become higher even still a bit cheaper than diesel fuels. Besides prices, technically gas is cleaner so it may give the lower emission levels. Dual fuel technology is the best choice in occupied gas as ship fuel due to the existence of the IGF Code. Established Dual-fuel diesel engine is very expensive and available for big power capacity. This research develops a small dual-fuel diesel engine from a conventional engine with power less than 10 HP. The piston crown is a part of the engine that was modified so that the engine can use natural gas in the best performances as the conventional one. NOx as the most hazard emission in the diesel combustion process is controlled to be as the lowest as possible. The quality of air may be significantly affected by those small engine pollutions because of the large number of vessels in that dense environment in the typical fishery villages. In conclusion, the modified dual-fuel diesel engine capable of reducing NOx emission by up to 31% at a practical safe operation of 50% dual-fuel. The higher gas portion gives a lower NOx emission level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The distribution network is the end link of the power grid. The level of management directly affects the power supply capacity and power quality. It is related to the operation level and social image of the power grid enterprise. The transformer is a very important component in the distribution network. The transformer is continuously safe and stable. Grid power supply reliability. In this context, this paper proposes an intelligent gateway intelligent fault detection algorithm for transformer operation failure, which collects data of transformers in multiple dimensions and multiple source channels, such as electrical variables and non-electrical variables. Correlation analysis and causality analysis of the data to achieve an all-round warning of transformer operation failure. The traditional method of transformer fault warning is solved by relying on the special gas concentration or transformer vibration signal generated by the fault of the transformer fault to solve the problem of fault identification and early warning singleness and low reliability, and fully exert the technical advantages of the Internet of Things and data mining. The evaluation value of the five "ancestor"elements is 0.2, 0.25, 0.15, 0.3, 0.1. Transformer operation fault trend early warning coefficient is set to 0.80. Once the early warning coefficient is found to exceed 0.80 during data collection and mining analysis, a transformer failure early warning will be issued, which can facilitate grid operators' intervention and control in advance. The actual calculation case also demonstrates the correctness and effectiveness of the intelligent mining algorithm.

abstract={The Renewable Energy conversion technology has been increasingly developed along with the awareness regarding the negative environmental issues caused by Non-renewable Energy waste. Vertical Axis Water Turbine (VAWT) is an interesting research object because of variety of advantages it offers. The Gorlov type VAWT is famous for its tendency to move regardless the water flow directions and able to rotate twice as fast as the inlet velocity. Things which need to consider important related to the turbine hydrodynamic effects including the quantity of blades, hydrofoil profiles, pitch angle, and turbine's dimension ratio. In this study, numerous variations were applied to determine the hydrodynamic effects caused especially torque output. Investigations were carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The Gorlov type turbine model is simulated in 3D under steady state flow conditions. The software used to run numerical simulations is ANSYS V18.1. The flow model used is laminar according to secondary data analysis. After the numerical simulation results are obtained, validation is performed with an average error rate of less than 10%. Variations chosen in this study is the pitch angle of 40° and 30 °, the dimension ratio in the form of 450 mm in diameter, the type of asymmetrical hydrofoil (S1210), and the quantity of blades (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Simulation results in the form of torque values showed that the best turbine performance is provided by NACA 0012 symmetrical hydrofoil with 40° pitch angle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Central Java is one of the provinces in Indonesia which has the most flood events, with a total of 1330 flood events in the span of 1819 to 2020. One of the watersheds in Central Java is the Pemali Watershed, most of which are in Brebes Regency. According to the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), there were 57 floods in Brebes Regency in 1994 - 2019. Therefore, to predict the occurrence of a flood disaster, it is necessary to know how much changes in river flow rates in the Pemali watershed. The purpose of this study was to determine the flood discharge at the Pemali river. The streamflow used is the maximum daily streamflow in a year from 2001 to 2017. The method used is the SHETRAN hydrological model. The data used in the SHETRAN model are the data derived from satellite measurements, namely digital elevation model data, MODIS land use land cover, soil type from the Harmonization World Soil Database, rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Missions, and evaporation data. The results of this study indicate that river flow rates can be predicted by modeling using SHETRAN. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Resistance greatly affects on selection of the main engine and ship fuel consumption. To achieve the speed of the ship, the ship must be prepared to overcome resistance in the waters to be passed by choosing the right engine according to the needs of the ship. In the last few years there have been many studies on biomimetics or the use of systems in nature to be applied in a technology. Such as the use of Leading edge protuberances. Despite its large size and stiff flexibility, the humpback whale has a good maneuver even when chasing prey compared to other animals of its size. This study aims to obtain the highest lift force result and the smallest resistance with a hydrofoil model configuration of leading edge protuberances which resembles a humpback whale fin (megaptra novaengliae). The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is applied to analyse lift faorce and ship resistance of all models variation. The results indicates that from all variation of models at the Fn 1.356, the model has 5 ° angle of attack were able to reduce the total resistance value of Pilot Boat by 35.13%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={During the long dry season hit most parts of East Java in 2019, there were 566 villages in 180 sub-districts that are categorized as dry areas with critical clean water supply, 236 villages in 93 sub-districts as rare dry areas, and 20 villages in 14 sub-districts experienced limited dryness. In big cities in Indonesia, clean water service coverage has only reached 64.3%, while in rural areas still at 69.4%. This proves that most of the regions in Indonesia still experiencing a clean water crisis. Therefore, alternative clean water processing technology is needed to help supply clean water in these areas. Desalination as one of the technologies is essential for coastal areas that are remote from freshwater resources. In this paper, authors propose a design of photovoltaic reverse osmosis (PVRO) desalination plant at remote coastal area to supply clean water. A 100 m3/day design of PVRO, which is compact and energy efficient including the ultrafiltration method is introduced. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia as a maritime country has many challenges in developing and making innovations in the marine sector. One of the challenges for Indonesia is how to respond to oil spill disasters that occur because of various events such as blow-out on oil platforms, ship collisions, pipeline leaks, and so on. In the end, marine and coastal pollution cannot be avoided. Karawang is one of the productive northern coastal areas of Java Island with various facilities such as single point mooring, oil wells, tourist areas and historical heritage. On July 15, 2019, an oil-well belonging to Pertamina Hulu Energi (PHE) ONWJ had leaked and polluted the sea and coast not only in Karawang, but also spread to Jakarta waters. As a result of this leakage, of course the impact is very large and varied from ecological, social and economic aspects. In this paper, an oil spill mapping will be carried out to determine the affected areas using sentinel-1 data. Data processing is assisted by open-source software SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform). As the result, August 19, 2019, oil spill seen in Bekasi area. So that oil slick move from Karawang to the west. This oil spill map area can be used in many ways such as clean-up strategy, calculating amount of dispersant, and many more. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Anti-Slamming Bulbous Bow (ASB) is a bulbous bow that has been modified according to the Anti-Slamming principle. For waters that have varying wave heights, for example, in the East Nusa Tenggara region where waters meet the criteria for the application of anti-slamming technology and are related to the existence of several offshore buildings and the use of tugging supply vessels (AHTS) for the benefit of the region. This research was conducted to determine the effect of installing anti-slamming bulbous bow and Anti-slamming height on the total resistance of the ship using numerical methods with the help of CFD software. The method used is to vary the height of anti-slamming and the type of bulbous bow on the bow of the ship. Ship modeling is carried out with CAD Software, and while the obstacle analysis uses CFD Tdyn software. Based on the analysis that has been done, the effect of the anti-slamming bulbous bow on the total resistance value of the ship without an anti-slamming bulbous bow is reduced by 3.75%. The ship model, with the use of the anti-slamming bulbous bow, which has the smallest total resistance, is the ship with the form of anti-slimming bulbous bow type Delta (Δ - Type). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The world of education dismisses students (studying at home) to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. In such conditions, teachers are challenged to apply all their abilities and expertise so that they can continue to teach students by transferring knowledge, pedagogic abilities, and their belief in successful online learning. This study aims to explore how lecturers can conduct teaching in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and what they use as a medium to conduct successful online teaching. In addition, researchers also want to know how lecturers can adjust the online teaching transition. The design of this research is qualitative research using deep interview tests to explore online learning that suits current needs. The research was conducted at the department of Office Administration Education Sebelas Maret University with the head of the study program as the key informant. The data validity test used source triangulation and method triangulation. The sampling technique was purposive snowball sampling, data collection techniques used observation, interviews and documentation, and data analysis techniques used interactive data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion drawing. The results show a good connection communication network of all students and lecturers is a major aspect that must be considered in lectures even though using simultaneously online social media, e.g. You Tube, Google Classroom, Google Meet, and WhatsApp. The Covid-19 pandemic is considered a challenge and an opportunity to conduct research in the field of information and communication technology (ICT) especially on digital classroom management. The outcomes of research that can be directly utilized by the user are the output targets research whose activities are manifested in the form of community service. Community Service Program (KKN) is a tangible form of student involvement in community service. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Rapid pace of digitalization of ecosystems in the modern world affect social and economic systems. State-of-the-art web technologies, a huge information system, have an increasing impact on human life. The information environment undergoes adverse effects during its functioning. To maintain functioning of the system information component, a properly constructed system and an adequate model of response to external effects are required. The response model in digital ecosystems will be designed with regard to three processes, namely: the problem formation process, the problem identification process, and the problem neutralization (elimination) process. An indicator of the efficiency of ecosystem functioning will be identification and neutralization of each problem. Simulation results confirmed the main trends in digital ecosystems functioning. The development and subsequent application of methods and techniques to achieve the set goal in a shorter time will always be relevant and in demand. To implement a rational approach to making managerial decisions, the leader responsible for digital ecosystem functioning can use network planning as a plan for the entire cycle of processes for maintaining the information security of the ecosystem as a whole. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Intensification of fisheries and aquaculture leads to an increase in anthropogenic pressure on ecosystems. The stability of many aquatic ecosystems, the most important suppliers of goods and services for human needs, is currently threatened. The concept of sustainable development that includes ecosystem approach to management is called upon to eliminate the threat of their degradation due to excessive economic use. The paper discusses the key problems arising from the exploitation of aquatic ecosystems, analyzes the features of the ecosystem approach to fishery management, and proposes a modified bioeconomic model to describe how digitalization of the fishing industry promotes the solution of its ecological, economic and social problems. The authors concluded that digital technologies make it possible to more accurately identify the optimal scale of fisheries and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems as the basic resources of this activity. Digitalization helps move to a new bioeconomic technological platform in fisheries, which is a responsible involvement of biological resources in the economic circulation that ensures a balanced and harmonious coexistence of business and ecosystems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Palm cattle integration is plants and livestock integrated activities in a farming unit. This system is part of the government programs to meet national beef's need at a macro level. It is also a strategy in optimizing land use to increase productivity and farmers' income. However, its implementation has not been developing and running optimally. This condition is caused by various technical and institutional constraints faced by smallholders. In the long term, it may affect its sustainability because farmers cannot overcome it only by using their resources and capabilities. It can be overcome by providing a support system. This paper aims to analyze the constraints and develop a support system model for smallholders to accelerate the implementation of palm cattle integration. The constraints faced by farmers are related to working capital, raw material, technologies, skills, market, and tools and machinery. The strategies include strengthening farmer and farmer groups, optimizing production and productivity, and developing a market link. The support facilities consist of factors to increase farmers' and farmer organizations' capabilities and provide resources. Providing support facilities will involve local government, private sector, cooperative, financial service, production service, market and institutional service, certification service, and research agency. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rice cultivation business is dominated by small farmers with average land ownership of less than one hectare. Consequently, all efforts that have been made were unable to improve the farmer's welfare. The small land ownership is a problem in applying mechanization, technology adoption, and management efficiency. The consolidation of the agricultural system in the form of an agricultural, institutional model is essential to be developed to achieve farming efficiency, profit, and, in turn, and farmer's welfare. An agro-socio-cultural and institutional model was designed to overcome problems faced by farmers. The study was conducted in Banjarnegara and Purbalingga Regencies, Central Java. The study applied FGD and survey methods. The results showed that most farmers' age was 60 years, and their educational attainment was a primary school, owned less than 0.7 hectares of land size, low technology adoption rates, and yield of fewer than four tons/ha. The condition causes the farmers to get low income, with an amount of fewer than three million rupiahs/month. Sociocultural conditions, land potentials, institutions, access to capital, and product marketing were the basis for developing an institutional model of rice farming. An institutional model concept was offered in the form of management consolidation. Several farmers gathered in a joint venture called the Rice Estate Community (REC), with approximately 300 hectares. Management consolidation supported mechanization application, science and technology transfer, easier access for market access and capital for rice farming. The REC was a model delivering farming efficiency and prosperity to farmers. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the national economy of Russia, elements of the digital economy are being actively implemented in various sectors of the economy. With regard to the agricultural sectors, digitalization of production management is an element of strategic development. Insufficiently high rates of development of this direction are accompanied by the influence of various exogenous and endogenous factors in the agricultural sectors of the regional level. The development of public-private partnerships in the agricultural sector of the economy is of great importance. The management of the regional agro-industrial complex requires the use of innovative technologies, including the digitalization of the sectoral economy. The basis of digitalization is the marketing concept of consumer orientation. The model of providing financial resources for state support in the development of the digital economy of agriculture in the Altai Territory is carried out in accordance with state and targeted programs. It is concluded that sectoral digitalization will increase the level of competitiveness of the region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The range of active dyes used for dyeing materials made of natural plant fibers includes about a thousand brands belonging to more than 50 groups all over the world. Among them, bifunctional active dyes are of research and practical interest. They allow to obtain intense and durable bright color scheme due to their chemical specificity. Also they save not only the dye itself, but a number of additional textile auxiliary substances, which in turn is favorably affects the environmental performance of the dyeing process. The authors present in the article the analysis of experimental data, which make it possible to obtain or verify chemical, physicochemical and coloristic indicators of the properties of mono-, bi- and polyfunctional active dyes. Conclusions are made on the dependence of these indicators in the process of dyeing textile materials according to several technologies most often used in finishing production. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={As a result of molecular genetic monitoring of bovine leukemia based on a set of methods (gene diagnostics - polymerase chain reaction (PCR), automatic sequencing; molecular phylogenetics) phylogenetic analysis presents the structure of an improved own replenished database (DB) for the characterized nucleotide sequences of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which includes information arrays contained in interconnected tables, which allows accumulating, storing, and combining all data through the formation of structured queries and reports with specified parameters in the database management system. At the same time, the results of the study are presented on the prevalence of BLV in the territories of some regions of Russia and Ukraine among the livestock; comparative analysis of genetic variants of the virus by genome loci: pol with clustering of the studied isolates into clade 1; env with the identification of 5 genotypes (GI (4%), GII (6%), GIV (79%), GVII (10%), GVIII (1%)) with the dominance of genotype IV ("European cluster"). In the course of the study, a low level of genetic variability among field isolates of BLV was established for the pol - 1.9% and env - 0.2-1.8% gene loci (depending on the genotype).

abstract={The state policy in the field of environmental management is part of environmental policy. One of the national priorities designated by the Russian government is the rational and competent use of natural resources, i.e. improving the system for monitoring the quality of air, soil and water, as well as the formation of a high environmental culture in society. One of the most important socio-economic tasks, as we see, is to study the state of the natural environment, predict changes in its conditions, both in natural conditions and under the influence of anthropogenic factors, in order to predict possible risks. The study of the problem of assessing the state of the environment in combination with the use of information technologies is very promising, including when analyzing the impact of toxicants on the environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={As we know the growing population give birth to many serious problems in the whole world but, the major one is the increase in hunger and unavailability of food. Due to the reduction in natural sources, limited arable land, unpredictable weather conditions crops growth is at risk today. The IoT allows agriculture to become data-driven, leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management, and limiting uncertainties and inefficiencies of environmental impact. This review is about an analytical survey of the application of IoT in arable farming to overcome challenges, suggesting possible solutions, and implementation and present some future directions in contrast with other agricultural systems. Current issues like the latest technologies, smartphones, intelligent management of WSN, middleware platforms etc. protrude because they have the power to transform arable farming into smart arable farming. For implementation, various challenges are encountered and interoperability is major hurdle throughout the architecture of the IoT system, which can be discussed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges like affordability, device power consumption, network latency etc. can be reviewed and solutions of these challenges are suggested. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The implementation of "smart"technologies in Russian agriculture has been revealed to be not large-scale. It has been substantiated that digital technologies based on artificial intelligence, analysis of large data arrays, and a fundamentally new interaction interface - virtual and augmented reality - transform current methodological approaches to economic planning. Particular attention was paid to transformed conceptual approaches in the methodology of economic planning of domestic agricultural production. The Internet of Things and measuring elements equipped with microprocessors and sensors, as well as special platforms and applications for monitoring have been proved to change the prevailing concept of the organization of planning and forecasting activities in agriculture. Special attention was paid to the implementation of the departmental project "Digital Agriculture"that is creating a model for the transition of the strategic planning system to a digital format. The model reflects the integration trends of modern information and communication technologies with agribusiness and authorities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of the article is to develop theoretical and methodological provisions related to identifying tools for the innovative development of the production of environmentally friendly food. From the standpoint of a systematic approach, the innovative development of organic food production presupposes the presence of a control and controlled subsystem, goals, methods and tools for their achievement. Deduction, logical method, analysis, scientific abstraction, analogy method are applied. It has been substantiated that the tools for the development of the production of environmentally friendly food should combine the efforts of business, science and the state (the "triple helix"model). A technological platform was chosen as a tool at the federal level, due to its focus, goals and resource potential. It is concluded that the presence of distinctive features in the development of organic food production indicates the need to highlight the strategic direction of the same name in the existing technological platform "Technologies of the food and processing industry of the agro-industrial complex - healthy food". © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the current economic conditions the regional development strategies are based on the achievements of science and innovation technologies. In this case the cluster approach is seen as an innovative technology of the regional economy management. The cluster is often used in modern economic systems as a term of the complex of industrial organizations, equipment suppliers, components and production services, scientific and educational organizations of territorial proximity and cooperation relations in goods or services production. The development of clusters in a market economy is needed to new production systems as the context of globalization and regionalization of economic activity. Using the Smolensk region as an example of great opportunities, we are considering the clustering generally, influence on the development of traditional industries in the region. The Smolensk region has a strategy of the flax cluster for 2018-2020. The positive dynamics of the flax development as cultivated areas can increase gross collection of the flax fibre in farms of all categories during the implementation of this strategy. It should be noted the region has problems in the flax industry; that why solving these issues it is possible to achieve sustainable competitive advantages applying measures for the flax cluster development of the Smolensk region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article describes the research of the morphological composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the Perm Territory during the period of self-isolation associated with SARS-CoV-2. It has been substantiated that the indicator of the morphological composition of MSW is decisive in the field of MSW management and determines the choice of the most acceptable method of waste disposal. Despite the growing interest in technologies for sorting and processing MSW, the most common method in Russia is waste disposal by soil methods - waste disposal at MSW landfills, which can pose a threat to the environment, since At many MSW disposal facilities, anti-seepage screens were not initially provided, there are no insulating backfills, many facilities are used beyond the design period. Experimental studies of the complex (morphological) composition of MSW were carried out in two settlements of the Perm Territory with a population of over 500,000 and a population of less than 300,000. The research methodology and tools are presented. The percentage of utilized components in the studied samples in the spring and summer seasons was calculated and the classification of the components according to the degree of biodegradation at MSW landfills, as well as the percentage of MSW components after the extraction of waste suitable for recyclable materials transported to the MSW landfills according to the research results. The percentage of the reduction in the penetration of hard-to-decompose and conditionally non-degradable fractions of MSW at the MSW landfills of the Perm Territory was calculated. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to study the morphological composition of MSW in the Perm Territory during a pandemic and to determine the percentage of components suitable for recyclability in the studied MSW samples by seasons (spring and summer seasons of 2020). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={At present, the Ocean Thermal Energy has low circulating thermal efficiency and poor power supply stability, so it has not been widely applied. To solve this problem, the combined generation system of ocean temperature difference energy and solar auxiliary heat is proposed. The multi-curved compound trough collector absorbs solar radiation energy, and layers heat exchange and energy storage with heat storage tank using heat conduction oil as medium. Then, the hot water storage and working medium preheated by warm sea water are used for efficient heat exchange in PCHE, so as to improve the system's power generation efficiency and improve the continuity of power supply. The Solar-Assisted Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion System is established by using Aspen Plus. The theoretical calculation and simulation analysis of each part of the system were carried out, and the thermal cycle with R717 as the working medium was determined. With Sansha City of Hainan Province as the background, the design is based on the installed capacity of 130kW solar auxiliary heat ocean temperature difference power generation system to verify the feasibility of the project. The energy management device takes PLC as the core, according to the load demand and the predicted power generation, through the fuzzy PID control strategy to adjust the flow of working medium and cold and hot source, and manage the power generation system. The energy management device effectively solves the intermittent problem of OTEC cycle power generation and the lack of power performance under the condition of sudden increase of power load, and realizes the system's all-weather stable operation. Based on the traditional form of ocean temperature difference power generation, this system proposes the integration of solar energy efficient heat collection, heat storage and ocean temperature difference energy combined power generation technology, which greatly improves the system power generation efficiency and has high popularization and application value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The advanced technology of the propulsion device is a national key research project, and PHM prediction and health management are among the core technologies. Our prediction of the remaining effective life (RUL) of the propulsion unit is a key part of the PHM technology. The data-driven method can effectively predict RUL. For example, the artificial intelligence method is widely used because it has certain advantages. Therefore, this paper uses machine learning algorithms to carry out RUL prediction research of propulsion devices. In addition, on the basis of support vector machine (SVM) regression theory, we combined the method of SBI (similarity-based interpolation), using Matlab program to build a prediction model. Both the practice samples and test samples of the model come from the engine simulation data, CMAPSS, provided by NASA. Finally, we use test samples to test the prediction model. The results show that the constructed model has good accuracy and robustness, and it can better predict the RUL of the propulsion unit. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The issue of climate change caused by GHG is increasingly serious. As the main emission source, the energy sector has promising potential for emission reduction. In the context of low-carbon technology transition in China's energy sector, this paper uses panel data of 30 provinces from 2000 to 2017, totally 297,721 patent data, and empirically examines how environmental regulation affects regional energy low-carbon technology innovation and diffusion under the framework of the "Porter Hypothesis". In addition, regional heterogeneity is also considered and the sub-samples of eastern, central and western regions were studied separately. The conclusions show significant heterogeneity in regions. The eastern region, which is less dependent on industries with high emissions and energy consumption, environmental regulation does not affect the innovation and diffusion of low-carbon technology in the energy sector. With the increasing intensity of environmental regulation, only the diffusion of low-carbon technology in the central region has been significantly improved, indicating that this region mainly adopts the introduction and learning of existing low-carbon technologies to meet the demand of emission reduction. Under the circumstances of high risk, uncertainty, sunk cost and opportunity cost brought by low-carbon energy technology, covered companies in western region are more inclined to relocate limited resources to schemes rather than low-carbon innovation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The interaction between surface water and ground water (SW-GW) is an important mechanism affecting wetland hydrological process and its ecological environment. Jixi Wetland, located in the western part of Jinan City, East China, was selected as the study area. The surface water bodies include Yuqinghu Reservoir, Yellow River, Yufu River, Jiping Trunk Channel and Xiaoqing River. Groundwater includes shallow pore water and deep fracture karst water. To strengthen water management and protection and understand different water exchange in the Jixi Wetland, ion composition, stable isotopes (d18O and d2H) and deuterium excess were studied. The result shows that the characteristic cation is Ca2+, and the characteristic anion is HCO3-. The main hydrochemical types of wetland water, Sedimentation Basin water and groundwater are HCO3·Cl - Ca·Mg water, the water of Jiping Trunk Channel is HCO3·Cl - Na·Mg type, the water of Yufu River is HCO3·Cl - Ca·Na type, and the water of Yellow River is HCO3·Cl - Na·Ca type. There is a hydraulic connection between SW-GW. The evaporation is strong in the surface water, while it plays a weak role in the groundwater. The dominant hydrogeochemical processes in the study area are lixiviation and cation alternating adsorption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The state and government departments will produce a large amount of soil survey data in the process of soil environmental pollution investigation. The format of soil data has diversified and multi-scale spatial characteristics. Due to the lack of a unified soil environmental pollution management platform in Yunnan Province, the storage of soil survey data is disorderly and messy. The data cannot be well-informed and scientifically analyzed, resulting in the inability to provide accurate and comprehensive soil environmental quality for all levels of government management data. In order to effectively solve this problem, taking soil heavy metal pollution survey sampling points in Yunnan Province as an example, this paper uses web geographic information systems (GIS) technology to design a set of soil environmental monitoring and analysis platforms that describe data sources, data collection, data analysis and visualization. The platform has established a scientific and rigorous data analysis method, which can uniformly convert and store historically scattered data and conduct unified management and analysis of survey data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={On road parking is a necessary supplementary form to solve the urban parking problem, which plays an important part in alleviating the parking demand pressure in residential areas. However, due to the poor management and use of on-road parking, there are problems such as parking confusion and illegal occupation of road resources, which affect the road capacity. Therefore, this paper takes Harbin residential area as an example to explore and explore on-road parking management strategy. Firstly, the status of on-road parking in residential areas is examined, and the deficiencies of on-road parking management in residential areas are analyzed. Referring to advance management experience and mode of on-road parking in residential areas abroad, and combined with the actual parking situation of Harbin residential areas, this paper puts forward the corresponding optimization strategy of on-road parking management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In order to develop rural eco-tourism better, it is very important to establish a suitable evaluation index system of tourism resources. This study constructs an evaluation indicator system of rural ecotourism resources in Shanghai from three aspects: Resource values, ecological environment and development conditions, which includes 18 indexes. Using AHP to determine the weight, in the comprehensive level of evaluation, Resource values (B1)> Ecological environment(B2) > Development conditions(B3). Among the most important indicators are: Recreational value (C1), Pollution control capability (C8), Farming experience value (C7), Environmental hygiene (C9), Convenience of transportation (C14), Ecological value (C4) and Life experience value (C6). By using this evaluation model to grade the rural ecotourism resources in Shanghai through questionnaire survey, the result is that the rural ecotourism resources in Shanghai are quite good. With the development of the construction of the Beautiful Country, the value of rural eco-tourism resources in Shanghai has been continuously explored and the eco-environmental quality is assessed higher, which provides an important guarantee for the development of rural eco-tourism in Shanghai. In addition, cultural values and health value need to be tapped in depth, and efforts should be made to increase the publicity and communication among local residents in rural tourist destinations. While optimizing the construction of tourism facilities, we must constantly improve the level of service management, so as to improve the service quality of rural ecotourism. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The steel industry is an important basic industry for the development of the national economy and national defense construction, but it is also a major source of energy consumption and environmental pollution. In particular, the carbon emissions in the process of coal combustion and steelmaking are huge. This situation urgently needs to be improved and optimized. Therefore, based on the perspective of the coal supply chain in the steel industry, this paper constructs a multi-objective planning model to achieve a balanced optimization of total economic costs and carbon emission reduction, and verifies the effectiveness of the model through specific case data. This paper sets three different emission reduction scenarios, discusses and analyzes the changes of economic total cost and carbon emission under different emission reduction scenarios, and finds that suppliers with good coal mining technology and low carbon emission factor have more opportunities to be selected and can obtain more coal market orders. At the same time, steel plants with mature processing technology and low carbon emission factor can further gain market competitive advantage and undertake more steelmaking tasks. Finally, based on results, management suggestions for coal suppliers and steel plants are provided. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Soil moisture temporal-spatial distribution and stability are important factors influencing soil pollutant transport, material migration, regional climate change, hydro-ecological environment as well as agricultural production patterns. According to soil moisture distribution features on the loess plateau, the paper selected three different kinds of surface slopes on the typical experiment sites to carry out soil moisture measurement. The variation coefficient and rank correlation method are proposed to calculate the longitudinal and vertical soil moisture distribution characteristics. The temporal-spatial dynamic features of soil moisture are studied. The present findings show that the soil moisture in the Loess Plateau varies greatly at different soil depths during the period from April to June. The maximum soil moisture appears at the depth of 40-60 cm. The variation coefficient of soil moisture increases with the soil depth. It was discovered that there exists temporal stability at the depth of 20-80cm. The correlation coefficient of soil moisture in different slopes is significant during the period of April-June. The results would play an important support in theoretical research and ecological environment planning, optimization of agricultural planting pattern and comprehensive management of Loess Plateau. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid development of China's oil and gas pipeline mileage, pipeline construction will be unable to avoid crossing high-risk areas such as disaster risk areas, densely populated areas, environmentally sensitive areas. The traditional extensive pipeline patrol method has been unable to meet the requirements of fine management, which puts forward a new test for the upgrade of safety monitoring technology. In this paper, the distributed optical fiber sensing technology which has been studied intensively in recent years is introduced. Through in-depth analysis of pipeline requirements and characteristics of accompanying optical cable, a single-end BOTDA solution suitable for long-distance oil and gas pipelines is proposed. A 400-meter pipeline trench was excavated along the route of a domestic product oil pipeline. Strain special cables and GYTA53 cables were laid concurrently. Twelve strain monitoring sections were set up using vibrating wire strain sensors. The strain of two kinds of optical cables was monitored under various working conditions, such as partial backfilling, full backfilling, manual compaction and heavy mechanical compaction, as well as the monitoring values of two kinds of optical cable for soil temperature. The test results show that: 1) the strain-sensitive fiber optic cable is sensitive to strain feedback, and can produce rapid feedback to 2m3 pile soil, while the stress feedback of pipeline-Accompanying fiber optic cable to soil is very small. 2) The temperature around the pipeline can be accurately reflected by the fiber optic cable, and it can be used for temperature compensation in strain monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={On the premise of rational utilization of soil and water resources, systematic engineering method is widely considered to balance agriculture and ecology. Regular planning is carried out by the authority based on historical data and future expectation, however, uncertain environment cannot be ignored. Hence, we propose an adjusted dynamic two-stage robust optimization framework to explore comprehensive managerial insights of irrigative areas and forest expansion. Dynamic planning is adopted to reflect the long-period planning, and two-stage is to differ "wait-And-see"decision from "right-And-now"decision. Considering the whole system' benefit, economic and ecological benefits are maximized and water scarcity, water/soil erosion penalties are minimized. To solve the proposed two-stage robust model, we propose two structural properties to obtain the global solution.

abstract={Blockchain is a new application model that integrates distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm, and other computer technologies. These technologies make blockchain traceable, reliable, and resistant to modification, characteristics that suit the need for data storage and exchange. As a result, in this paper, we design an energy internet big data system based on energy and blockchain technology systematically. Firstly, we discuss the basics that support for energy scheduling and policymaking of the management department, including energy data coordination, enterprise monitoring, and consumption monitoring, and trading services. Secondly, we develop the Unified Energy Reporting Service. It can generate the energy demand and supply table, production and sales table, demand forecast table, energy consumption monitoring table, environmental protection monitoring data, and energy data of critical customers. Finally, we ensure the storage and collection of evidence in our system, which would guarantee the electric security of the Winter Olympic Games. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The paper discusses relevant problems associated with the exploitation and processing of mineral waste accumulated from mining enterprises during the industrial era. To ensure the preservation of a vulnerable Arctic environment it is necessary to search for the new innovation technologies aimed at increasing the comprehensive use of waste for various purposes of the national economy. The main aim of the work is to assess the efficiency of industrial waste management for the period 2010-2019 by the Arctic mining enterprises which provide open access to the necessary research information. The methodological basis of the analysis are annual reports of enterprises, official documents and scientific publications. The analysis showed that wastes of I-III hazard classes are significantly reduced which meets the requirements of the legislation but wastes of IV and V classes showed multidirectional dynamics and growth respectively. It is shown that for the further improvement of the waste management system there is a need of directions for the search for new comprehensive approaches as development of innovation technologies, reuse of waste with release of new products as part of transition to a circular economy and use of green technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This article presents a conceptualized analysis of technology-related risks for a transportation safety system. It also considers its subsystems that impact safety. The scheme developed allowed defining the key factor influencing transport safety through accounting various destabilizing impacts. The authors claim that the human factor is the key one, which is especially true for locomotive crews responsible for transportation. Locomotive crew working conditions are described in a visualized combination of negative effects people suffer in an engine cab. Based on the statistics collected and analyzed, the article presents specific occupational diseases of transportation workers. The dynamics of mental capacity and the state of the cardiovascular system of locomotive crews were analyzed using the WAIS test. The research results can be used in the practices of the Russian Railways to facilitate the efficiency and coherence in decision making related to labor safety. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Digitalization of the economy requires new specialists for data-based management called Chief Data Officers (CDOs). It is noted that digitalization is no longer the prerogative of a single IT industry. The digital transformation of the construction industry introduces general processes of digitalization, but it has its own peculiarities. The technology of building information modeling (BIM) is being implemented by construction sector companies. The specialist who leads the implementation of information modeling technologies in the organization is a BIM manager. A BIM manager, as well as CDO, must have competencies in the field of IT, management, and data applications. Analysis of the functions and competencies of a BIM manager allows us to conclude that he can become a CDO for managing the organization's production activities based on BIM data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article considers the impact of digitalization on the innovative processes in the economic agrarian sector. Today a key trend of agricultural development is digitalization. It will help increase the volume of agricultural production and the profitability of the agroindustrial complex industries. In the developed countries, digitalization has a positive effect creating new management principles and rules for the innovative activity conduct. In Russia the development of digital economics and the introduction of innovations into the agroindustrial complex is limited by depleted technical facilities, financial pressure and staff qualification. In the framework of the research the authors have identified that the digital technology introduction will increase labor efficiency, product quality, decrease inflation and unemployment providing for a stable economic growth. However, most technologies are accessible only for large and medium business. The authors suggest forming IT platforms in the agrarian sector of the country's macroregions with the state&private interaction in part of innovation introduction. Understanding the importance of digital technology introduction into the economic agrarian sector as a method of increasing the efficiency of agricultural production, the state builds a general strategy of breakthrough innovation introduction. Consequently, digital technologies will accelerate the integration of various economic areas transforming the innovative processes into an essential trend of economic development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={To make management decisions, it is necessary not only to have reliable data, but to adequately and timely analyze them as well. Applying digital technologies in agriculture, decision support systems for diet formulation with mathematical exactness will allow planning animal's feeding taking into account many factors (animal genotype, age, seasonality, etc.). The growth and development of animals, their productivity depend primarily on the level of balanced feeding. The article proposes a computer system methodology for evaluating and optimizing the diet of animal feeding based on a structural-parametric model. The advantage of the structural-parametric model of animal feeding is that it considers the whole variety of factors of nutrients influence on the processes occurring in the animal's body, depending on its current physiological state; allows one to establish patterns, the knowledge of which with a sufficient degree of confidence speaks about possible deviations in feeding, the reasons for their occurrence; allows one to find a solution to replenish the imbalance in the required macro- A nd micronutrients. The use in agriculture of science-intensive decision support systems based on knowledge of the subject matter experts and strictly verified mathematical methods will increase the productivity of animals and provide a high-quality product with the ability to trace the trophological chain from the field to the counter. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={However, the low effectiveness of the procedures, which regulate socio-economic relations, such as underestimation of the importance of a problem such as the need for their restructuration lead to a necessity in increased attention throughout the economic entities of the real sector of the economy. The urgency of this research problem can be determined by the lack of development of the tools which in turn lead to the development and implementation of personnel policy, aimed at improving the socio-labor relations by making sure to provide sustainable employment inside the organization and effective regulation of the internal labor market. The article demonstrates that personnel policy is not only the main element of socio-labor relations but also a key part for personnel management decisions, since it predetermines the receipt of an overall positive synergetic effect. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that developing organizations which have based their policies on active innovation and strategic processes both internally and externally are characterized for using multiple personnel policies simultaneously resulting to distortions within the organization, which in turn negatively affect the performance of the organization as a whole. It is substantiated that personnel policy should not be regarded as an obligatory formal document, but more as a strategically significant decision for personnel management, which in turn could affect not only the destiny of the organization but also their balance of power among the competitive environment both positively or negatively depending on how correctly it was set. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={To further increase the contribution of extractive industries to the gross regional product of the Northern and Arctic regions, it is necessary to increase their efficiency through technological modernization and automation of production processes. It is shown that the structural investment and innovative industrial policy in the North should be aimed at supporting the introduction of technological innovations by enterprises, primarily in the field of more complete and integrated use of natural resources. To assess the economic feasibility of technological modernization of industrial enterprises, it is proposed to use the methodology of investment and innovation analysis, which includes three stages of management decision-making. At the first stage, preliminary goals are set to achieve the necessary level of innovative and technological development of enterprises. At the second stage, a decision is made either to further improve the existing production technology or to switch to a new technology. At the third stage, various possible options for technological renewal of production are considered and the best option is determined with its subsequent implementation in the form of an investment project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The research objective is to study the possibility and prospects of applying qualimetry techniques to estimate the economic effect of using Earth remote sensing data in agriculture when digitally transforming the sector, considering both quantitative and qualitative efficiency indicators of economic, technical, environmental, and political and social nature and the impact of the environment on them. Based on the systematic analysis of the state and development trends of both the Earth remote sensing technology infrastructure and agriculture itself, a theoretical rationale for applying qualimetry techniques to estimate the economic effect of using these technologies in agriculture with a mathematical description of individual and integral estimates of their efficiency has been formalized. Qualimetry techniques have been compared with the efficiency estimating method based on the system of production functions. The scientific novelty of the study is the development of a scientifically grounded approach based on a formalized mathematical description to choosing a base object for estimating the economic effect of using ERS data in agriculture as part of a promising digital precision farming platform based on Earth remote sensing technologies and obtained, in turn, as a result of mathematical simulation of creating the country's economy digital management platforms. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={There are considered the results of digital technologies development within oceanographic support for maritime activities in Arctic and Subarctic while climate change. While research, authors used Foresight technologies, theory of decision making under uncertainties, risk management approach, methods of data bases constructing in case of digital decision support platforms. Recently, the trends in oceanographic support for maritime activities demonstrate new concepts in data obtaining and presenting. Authors give the preference to usage of digital decision support platforms, which integrate heterogeneous hardware and software resources with the use of web-technologies in distributed networks and wide application of cloud services. As base model for decision support, we proposed to use block diagram of geo-information support decision within in environmental economics while climate change. The proposed basic model allows direct assessment of the oceanographic support cost impact on the overall business profit from maritime activities in Arctic and Subarctic while climate change.

abstract={The level of implementation of information and communication technologies in agriculture changes the demand for information support for crop production management. The study showed that the main criteria for selecting mobile crop applications in Russia are recommendations from friends and colleagues, content and timeliness of data updates, cost of use, language, user reviews and ratings. According to the scope of application, the author has identified the following groups of mobile applications: management of technical means; control and measurement of technological parameters; production planning; management decision support, knowledge development, communication and consulting; sales and purchasing organization. The most popular applications for Russian crop production workers are applications for precision farming technologies, navigation, agro calculators, nitrogen management, process maps and reference books. The results obtained differ from the global ones and are explained, in our opinion, by cultural and geographical characteristics, the level of digitalization of the economy, education, and technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The economy of the Russian Federation at the present stage is characterized by an extremely high level of consumption of raw materials and waste generation. This is due to the export-raw material orientation of production, as well as the level of technological development. In this regard, the amount of waste generation and accumulation is steadily increasing. Analysis of current trends has shown that every year, on average, Russians emit about 80 million tons of municipal waste. At the same time, both in Russia and in other countries, the structure of MSW is approximately the same. These are primarily glass, paper, plastics, fabrics and organic products, as well as oversized items such as old furniture, car parts, etc. At first glance, recycling household garbage is a fairly simple and profitable business. Thus, by recycling car tires, you can get rubber coatings that are actively used in the economy, new paper is made from waste paper, and organic garbage is obtained from. The methodology used for creating data or information flow diagrams is described. The relevance of using this technology in modern practice is shown. The practical application of the DFD methodology in modeling a new financing system in the field of solid municipal waste management is presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The ports of the Primorye-1 and Primorye-2 corridors in Primorsky Territory are the most important channels for foreign trade and transit of the Far East with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The interest of the leading economies of the Asia-Pacific region, in particular China, in the use of the corridor infrastructure determines their transit potential. As elements of the international commodity distribution chain, ports' infrastructure as well as their management system require modernization. Today, the world's leading logistics operators strive to implement digital technologies in management and automate processes in order to increase their competitiveness. This article outlines the prospects for the implementation of digital technologies in the management of the southern ports of Primorsky Territory. Authors provide a justification for such modernization in terms of increasing the competitiveness of the region's sea transport. The concept of digitalization of the ports located in the south of Primorsky Territory and the establishment of a unified regional management system can become one of the ways to develop sea logistics in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Digital platform and digital molds Thanks to the collection of data in the entire technological system, they can forecast the status of equipment and route workload and adopt management decisions based on this data and the forecast. [4] The importance of introducing digital innovations in the southern ports of Primorsky Territory is outlined in the “Strategy for Social and Economic Development of Primorsky Territory until 2030.” Primorye-1 and Primorye-2 internal transportation corridors are see the largest number of investment projects being implemented. These projects provide for the introduction of new capacities for transshipment of goods in regional ports, modernization of border infrastructure (including the construction and expansion of ports, checkpoints, and road and rail infrastructure), and also simplification of border procedures for transit cargo delivered from Russia and China. This strategy is due to the strengthening of the eastern direction in cargo traffic and the formation of a transit corridor for transportation goods to and from China, Mongolia, and other countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, the possibility of digital modernization is supported by the interest of foreign investors, primarily Asian ones. Of course, there is the stagnation of the Russian economy that holds the investors back. Due to this, the influx of foreign investments from offshore companies is decreasing. [6, 7] However, transportation is a key industry for large-scale investments in the long term.},

abstract={This study discusses the development of digitalization processes in the world and the Russian Federation, how they are manifested in the economy and, in particular, in industry. Weak performance of the Russian Federation in the digitalization field is noted with the main reasons indicated. The role of the "Digital Economy of the Russian Federation"Program in the development and implementation of digital technologies into domestic practice is shown. The development of these technologies is uneven in various national economy sectors, as well as their prospects in the field of material production, including industry. The ways of accelerated adaptation of industrial enterprises to digital reality are shown. These paths include, in particular, the development of dynamic capabilities of companies, transition to end-to-end industrial systems, adoption of the smart enterprise concept based on the SAP S/4HANA platform. The relevant positive experience of certain industrial companies is shown. In the context of digitalization, the sustainable development (SD) concept gains more priority with the continuous adaptation of economic systems to the changing requirements of the external environment. The dependence of the sustainable development level on the economy digitalization degree is shown. The main goals of sustainable development of economic entities are formulated, approaches are described for linking these goals with the corresponding goals at the level of the region, industry and the country as a whole. It is noted that the sustainable development of industrial enterprises during digitalization can be fully ensured only with effective support from the state based on the GR management concept. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Environmental quality (EQ) has always been paid more attention in big cities, where urbanization is on the rise because it greatly affects urban natural ecosystems and people's health. The paper presents the results of applying Landsat satellite images to evaluate the Natural Environmental Quality (NEQ) from the integrated index NEQI (Natural Environmental Quality Index) through the calculation of biophysical variables, including vegetation index NDVI, water surface index NDWI, construction index NDBI and land surface temperature LST. The study area is the north of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), divided into 3 sub-regions for analysis, including 13 old inner-city districts, 6 new inner-city districts, and 4 suburban districts. The results showed that there is a difference in NEQI between inner and suburban areas. Low NEQI is concentrated in urban areas with high urbanization rate, industrial zones, areas with large impervious surface areas and low greenery density. In the suburbs, in contrast, NEQ is better than in the inner city. If considering by the acquisited time of two satellite images in February of 2005 and 2020, the NEQ of the study area showed signs of decreasing and gradually expanding area from the inner city to the suburbs. Particularly in the suburbs, due to the urbanization process in recent years, there are spontaneous and unplanned development areas, so NEQ has changed towards a decrease. The results of the study can be used to support urban environmental planning and management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes a new approach for urban land use management by using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Experimental result covers 121 ha (1.21 km2) at Binh Tho ward, Thu Duc district of the Ho Chi Minh city and shows that UAV technology is most suitable and cost effective for cadastral mapping and updating the database with high accuracy. In this research, 36 GCPs (Ground Control Points) and 2433 parcel boundaries (GIS data) were used to compare the achieved accuracy of UAV method in which 10381 orthophoto imageries produced had a resolution of 1.8 cm (with flying altitude 70 m) to be used to inform urban database. This technology opens a new way that is most suitable and cost effective for small areas, where digital maps and 3D models need to be produced in a short period of time with high data quality and accuracy. There are no significant barriers to imbed the technology at the local level and it can speed up the process of updating database in developing the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) of the smart city. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the development of remote sensing technology systems with medium-high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution is very fast. Remote sensing technology has been widely used in the extraction of feature elements and has achieved good results. If we could identify tree species accurately use remote sensing technology, it will be convenient and efficient to obtain the area of single fruit planting in the investigation of large-scale and multi-variety agricultural products. Then providing guidance for the planning of fruit tree and avoiding expanding planting area blindly according to price trends to bring planting economic benefits. At present, the tree species structure in the fruit growing area is complex, and it is difficult to accurately distinguish a single tree species. The existing extraction method to pomegranate cultivation area is poor effective. Therefore, based on the multi-source remote sensing image and field data, we should preprocess the remote sensing image firstly, then we do the band difference, ratio analysis, spectral index calculation spectral index change tracking, image composite and identification methods co-processing. In the last step we analyse the differences of NDVI values and spectral characteristics of remote sensing images of different tree species in different periods, then we can recognize and extract the pomegranate in fruit tree planting area. The results of the experiment indicate that the method can effectively extract the distribution information of pomegranate trees in complex areas where planting information is available. Thus it can be extended to other crop identification research, which can provide a good reference for the development of precision agriculture and intelligent agriculture management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the advent of the information age, the establishment of high-precision, low-cost digital image maps are increasingly more important for surveying and mapping engineering, land management, forestry, and marine monitoring. Combining real remote sensing imagery with computer science and technology to produce an intuitive and clear digital image map has become a trend in the development of GIS systems today, but professional image data is expensive to purchase, resulting in greatly improving system development cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method based on Google Earth and GIS technology to develop a system for application. The system mainly includes geographic information collection (according to remote sensing image acquisition), geographic information storage and management (using database technology) and digital map production three Module. The key technologies of the system are the establishment of regional geographic model, attribute data management, the establishment of information database and information query and analysis. The system can provide digital image maps with high efficiency and low production, and establish the database to realize the timely exchange and sharing of geographic data. Compared with the traditional drawing method, the system reduces the cost of development, and improves the authenticity, intuitiveness and practicability of the GIS system; and compared with MapInfo and ArcView, the system is easier to operate and to draw efficiently without professional image data. The digital image map made by the system can save a lot of manpower, material and financial resources after the actual production, which improve the work efficiency and reduce work intensity, and also provide theoretical and technical guidance for the current surveying curriculum teaching. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={At industrial enterprises the problem of the human resources quality in the field of its compliance with the increased requirements due to innovative development of digital technologies is becoming more and more relevant. This circumstance necessitates a deep rethinking of the management priorities based on innovative development of digital technologies at domestic industrial enterprises. At the same time, managerial interest in the intellectualization of employees as a reproduction process built into the innovation activity increases. Using infrastructure-reproduction approach, the concept of intellectual infrastructure for technological development at industrial enterprises is formed. Its content and purposeful influence on transformation processes and improvement of the personnel management system are revealed. As the central target of such improvement, the management organization of employees' intellectual resources is defined. Its values are determined by the interrelated components of human resources that form the intellectual potential of the personnel. The result is aimed at practical improvement of personnel management at modern industrial enterprises. Methods of system analysis, scientific modeling, as well as economic and statistical ones are used. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A new composite electrochemistry-dual circuit polarization model (E-DCP) is proposed by combining the advantages of various electrochemical empirical models in this paper. Then, the multi-innovation least squares (MILS) algorithm is used to perform online full parameter identification for the E-DCP model in order to improve data usage efficiency and parameter identification accuracy. In addition, on the basis of the E-DCP model, the MILS and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) are combined to enhance the state estimation accuracy of the battery management system (BMS). Finally, the model and the algorithm are both verified through urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and the complex charge-discharge loop test. The results indicate that the accuracy of E-DCP is relatively high under different working conditions, and the errors of state of charge (SOC) estimation after the combination of MILS and EKF are all within 2.2%. This lays a concrete foundation for practical use of the BMS in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the air pollution in China is becoming more and more serious, especially in Beijing. In this paper, an air pollution information management system was established by using ComGIS component of ArcEngine and Visual C# .NET platform and SQL Server technology. The system consists of three modules, including basic function, spatial analysis and early warning. It can monitor air pollution from different angles. In order to realize the simulation of pollution diffuse and the visual management of air pollution, we developed this system to monitor and analyse the air pollution situation in Beijing in quasi real time. Air pollution concentration data recorded by the monitoring station in Beijing on May 23, 2015 was obtained. The results showed that the severe atmospheric pollution in Beijing was mainly distributed in Chaoyang, Xicheng, Dongcheng and Fengtai districts. The area with severe PM2.5 exceeding the standard was located near the Monitoring station of Yizhuang Development. However, it indicated that the severely polluted areas extended from Daxing and Tongzhou districts to Xicheng, Dongcheng and Chaoyang districts when simulating the diffusion of PM2.5 pollutants by adding wind power and wind direction data on the same day. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Africa is a key area for overseas oil and gas investment cooperation due to the low degree of oil and gas exploration and great resource potential. All oil and gas resource countries have certain common characteristics in contract modes, fiscal and tax terms, economic conditions, infrastructure and bidding methods. A theoretical system of rapid economic evaluation technology suitable for the characteristics of Africa can be established to provide the methods and basis for investment decisions of oil and gas development projects in Africa. In this paper, on the basis of a systematic study on oil contract modes in Africa and the legal terms, sales market, actual operations and evaluation and prediction parameters to be focused on, an economic evaluation index system has been established, including analysis framework establishment, financial benefit analysis and uncertainty analysis; finally, an oil and gas development project in Africa is taken as an example to verify the above-mentioned rapid economic evaluation technology. This technology system is applicable to economic evaluation of most oil and gas development projects in Africa, covering the possible factors, scenarios and problems in the process of project evaluation, facilitating the realization of a rapid and effective economic evaluation process and the achievement of scientific and reasonable results. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Since sewage treatment plant consumes much of electric energy in the city, the optimization and improvement of the equipment and energy consumption monitoring management system is conducive to its development and even driving an energy-consuming society. There are a total of 20 sewage treatment plants of towns that directly affect the water environment of Dianchi Lake. Due to the dispersion of sewage treatment data, the lack of regular testing of water quality, poor accuracy and reliability of data, difficulty in evaluating the effect of sewage treatment and the lack of data management standards and norms, the water quality and quantity will have an impact on the ecosystem of Dianchi Lake if the water from plants is discharged directly or indirectly into the riverways, tributaries or channels of the Lake. Therefore, building a water quality monitoring system for 20 sewage treatment plants of Kunming is an important measure to ensure the water quality and improve the ecosystem of Dianchi Lake.

abstract={The article, based on the comprehensive review and the case study of Port of Los Angeles, investigates the driving force for the development of the port emissions inventory in numerous aspects including environment, public health, economy and society. It includes the summary of the typical methodology for establishing the port emissions inventory, thus allowing the policy makers from more ports including port authorities and operators with no such expertise or experience obtain the insights in terms of strategy, policy and technology which may inspire them to develop their own emission inventories which could be the foundation for decision making related to the emission control and reduction. In addition, the article analyzes the performance of the inventory in facilitating designing the air pollution management measures against various emission sources, especially the critical air emissions from the ocean-going vessels causing significant negative effects in port and coastal areas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Fishery management is all efforts that are integrated in laws and regulations in the field of fisheries to achieve sustainable productivity of aquatic biological resources. Fishery management activities in a water area with a high number productivity of fish resources have to pay attention to aspects that can support of goal the achievement of environmentally friendly and sustainable fisheries management. Pidie District is located in the east of Aceh which is directly opposite the Malacca Strait and has a high productivity of fish resources using various fishing gear. The purpose of this study was to determine the management strategy for environmentally friendly fishing gear based on the code of conduct for responsible fisheries (CCRF) in Pidie District. The data analysis method used in this research is descriptive, scoring, and SWOT analysis. The results, strategies used within environmentally friendly capture fisheries management are enhancement, monitoring, and law enforcement upon the un - selective fishing gears that tend to be destructive, optimize human resources in utilizing fish resources to environmentally friendly capture fisheries management in both of pre-production to post - production, improve the capacity of facilities and infrastructure in supporting environmentally friendly capture fisheries operations, monitor fisheries activities as well surrounding areas of port upon the pollution that harms environmental quality order, and socialization upon the used of environmentally friendly current technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Fishpond farmers cultivate their pond lands on marginal land conditions by means of subsistence. The research was to analyze the pond's management, the income of the pond farmers, and the subsistence pond business development model towards product diversification. This research was conducted on ponds in Kendari Bay, Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Determination of respondents using purposive sampling method with the consideration that pond farmers have carried out milkfish cultivation in the last three years. This study uses a simple statistical approach, income analysis, descriptive analysis and product diversification model. The main findings of this research are that pond farmers have applied fertilization technology, pest eradication and water circulation. Fertilization grows moss which is used as milkfish feed. Most of the respondents only provide moss as the only feed for milkfish. On the other hand, the pond land has also been polluted. The results of this study show that subsistence pond farmers have very little income, only Rp. 4,689,000/year. Thus, the recommended model for developing a pond business is a product diversification model. The product diversification referred to is: 1) milkfish and shrimp cultivation, 2) thorn-pulled milkfish and frozen shrimp processing, 3) Utilization of dragon fruit cultivation pond embankments, 4) fishing areas, and 5) culinary grilled fish from the pond. Based on the results of product diversification simulation analysis, it is known that the pond farmers can increase their income through product diversification. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The paper focuses on the possibilities of using the technology of geographic information systems (GIS-technologies) and data on the Earth remote sensing to determine the morphometric parameters of the river basin on the example of the upper part of the Charysh River (Russia). The authors conclude that a river basin is a holistic natural complex in which all physical parameters are interdependent and have specific features for each basin. Geographic information methods are used to study hydrological objects and in the modeling of drainage basins as natural compound complexes. In combination with GIS technologies, remote sensing methods are convenient for deciphering and assessing the hydrological situation of territories. For the upper part of the Charysh River basin, a complex of morphometric calculations was performed. Based on DEM and satellite images, thematic layers for GIS were built, and the thematic layers were designed as maps. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper studies the taxation indicators of previously developed standards for evaluating the productivity of Korean pine plantations. Rehabilitation of cedar stands is impossible without growth tables. The analysis shows that the productivity assessment of cedar trees as a renewable resource should be accompanied by working standards, bringing the plantings to a given goal. In other words, the norms should be compiled for a specific purpose, for example, the cultivation of nut plantations. Korean pine is a nut-bearing plant, and it is its most crucial production function for a wide range of consumers, including humans. At the moment, this formation was "not available"due to the overexploitation of raw (wood) resources in the last century. To return it to Russia's renewable energy system in the next 30 years, it is necessary to review all functions to optimize them at different management levels. The analysis shows that with the help of modern technologies, it is possible to ensure the transition to a significant forest formation in various production areas, taking into account the demand for its products. This main transition elements are a high-quality regulatory framework, its compliance with the real capabilities of the formation, and favorable market conditions for products obtained from this formation. A bet on renewable energy sources will allow the world economy to avoid crisis periods, including those of a socio-ecological nature. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Big data greatly impact current social science research paradigms and traditional safety management. Moreover, widespread big data application in coal mine safety technology has also highlighted the lack of basic coal mine safety management review against the background of big data. Based on the above analysis, the three main article goals are (1) to study the fundamental safety management research changes within the big data context; (2) to analyze big data application in coal mine safety management; and (3) to discuss big data relevance in coal mine safety management development trends and challenges. In summary, integrating big data into coal mine safety management has become a research trend, and the current coal mine safety management theory in the field of big data requires more in-depth research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Many authors have worked on the impacts of KM in business sector but very few on its influence on academic performance (AP). The studies on KM concept and its applications suggested that both process capability and strategy capability could drive innovation and improve institutional performance. However, these studies were not empirically validated thereby subjecting their findings to dispute. Grouping KM Capabilities into three, and adopting Survey method where questionnaires were administered to extract data from 10 Nigerian universities, this study empirically examines the relationship amongst the KM capabilities components and their influence on AP. SPSS was used to the data. Frequency and percentage count were used to analyse the demographic data while factor analysis, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for the hypotheses. The results showed that there is a significant relationship amongst the KM capabilities components and that a positive linear relationship exists between the KM capabilities and the key AP indicators thereby suggesting that KM capabilities has a positive influence on AP. Nigerian institutions are to be giving more attention to Enabler Capabilities which proved to be the most influencing factor amongst the indicators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The recent urbanisation in the developing nations of the world, rise in population, increase in human activities. Pattern of production and consumption has resulted to generation of huge amount of waste that must be properly disposed, treated and managed to ensure sustainable environment and a decent living for the increased population. The current waste management practices are not effective and efficient enough to handle the rise in waste level. The traditional approachhas led to this challenge. This paper deals with a systematic review of existing literatures, identifying and characterizing active research activities on smart waste bin that will allow effective waste management. There is a great need for deployment of this Smart technology on a large scale in the developing nations of the world for a sustainable healthy and clean environment. However, the cost of applying such solutions is still relatively high. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Recycling organic of house waste remains fairly limited especially in urban area with low-and middle-income. A novel approach is developing method to manage the organic waste conversion using larvae Black Soldier Fly (BSF). The advantage of this approach links to the green technology waste management which is no pollutant effect to the environment as well as increase the added value economically. The research project successfully presented organic house waste conversion into high protein of animal feeding source. From the 5 dol of larva BSF's (approximately 17 gr), it was reduced organic waste ± 0.7 kg/day. Within 10 days, the larva BSFs of 17 dol was consumed organic waste ± 10 kg, with increase their weight to become approximately 10 kg. The larva BSF of 17 dol is potential as animal feeding source that contain a high of protein. Furthermore, the waste from BSF's cycle life is potentially to convert into chitosan, due to contain of chitin. Chitosan was produced from the waste of larvae skin, pupa skin and insect imago death. In general, this organic waste management is offering to green organic waste management in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Manual monitoring of the eutrophication status of water bodies such as a dam is a challenging task. Hence, drone technology can be used in assisting the monitoring work of any water bodies. This study was conducted to develop UAV-based remote sensing to derive indicators in lake water bodies. Four sampling points were chosen for testing where the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) were assessed. DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone was used for the aerial data acquisition. Ex-situ data were also acquired, such as nitrate concentration (N) and phosphate concentration (P). The hyperspectral UAV images were ortho-rectified and geo-referenced in Agisoft PhotoScan software and NDVI value estimation in ArcGIS. Results show the correlation between NDVI values and N and P concentration with coefficients values of 0.7079 for P concentration and 0.7004 for N concentration, respectively. This study confirmed the applicability of remote sensing for water resource management using UAVs, characterized as a quick and easy methodology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Spatial and temporal water availability uncertainties are the major constraints to dryland crops productivity. Comprehensive hydrologic survey to determine water harvesting location as supplementary irrigation source is the key to increase dryland cropping index. This research was conducted in Lampung during April to December 2019. The aims of this research were to develop water management designs and irrigation techniques for upland rice and maize cultivation under perennial crops. The applied irrigation techniques consisted of sprinkler, furrow, and hose spray, while 3 varieties of the used upland rice were Rindang 1, Rindang 2, and Inpago 10. Results of this research revealed differences in crop productivity between paddy under "sengon"and rubber. This finding suggests supplement irrigation requirement from water harvesting infrastructures to increase land productivity during dry season. Moreover, the percentage of tolerable shading was up to 50% or 3 year age of the perennial crops. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesia's dry agricultural lands development requires support of appropriate water-saving irrigation technology to cope water shortages. Especially for mung bean, irrigation based on crop-water requirement is needed due to the short vegetation phase that water shortages could increase the risk of yield lost. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of irrigation level on the growth and yield of mung bean. This research conducted in acid soil through two factors of completely randomized design in a greenhouse. The first factor was irrigation volume, i.e., 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the crop water requirement, the second factor was mung bean varieties, i.e., Merak and Vima 1, with three replicates respectively. The results showed that drip irrigation increased water use efficiency. Moreover, water requirement for mung bean during the growth period was 320.72 mm, with tolerable water stress just reached up to 80% of the standard water requirement. The response of irrigation water to crop height was shown at 30 Day After Planting (DAP). This research also identified that Vima 1 was significantly responsive and adaptive to water stress, so it has a very good opportunity to be developed on dry land acid soil in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Tidal agricultural land (TAL) is a marginal farming field that is highly available but yet to be optimized in Indonesia. Productivity enhancement of TAL is achievable through agriculture technologies, but water management is the key solution to TAL main problems, i.e. flood and drought cycle. The main objective of this research was to predict tidal cycle for available planting time optimization in TAL. Research was conducted on 100 hectares TAL in Jejangkit, Barito Kuala, South Kalimantan, with the Alalak river become the main subject of the hydrodynamics monitoring. Watershed water balance simulation model run on 10-day interval was utilized to predict the tidal cycle with 4 input parameters including water-level, precipitation, percolation, and evapotranspiration. The prediction result showed that the available planting months in Jejangkit TAL was about 8 months, between the first or second 10-day of May and third 10-day of January or first 10-day of February (calibration and validation R2 were 0.78 and 0.92, respectively). On-field validation in Jejangkit recorded flood event started during the third 10-day of January 2020, which indicated that the prediction was reliable. This result shows that tidal cycle could be simulated using watershed water balance model to assist farmers on TAL's productivity enhancement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Agricultural activities such as an inorganic nitrogen fertilization and biomass burning contribute to increase the N2O emissions from the agricultural sector. Integrated Pest Management Field School (IPM) in chili plantations using organic based fertiliser and the application of silver-black plastic mulch promote to reduce the N2O emissions from agricultural sector. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reduction of N2O emissions using organic based fertilizer and silver-black plastic mulch treatment on IPM school plots in Rembang and Sukabumi Regencies. The results showed that there was no significant different on N2O emission from the organic based fertilizer and plastic mulch application to the control. However, treatment of organic based fertiliser and silver-black plastic mulch in IPM plots contribute to reduce the N2O emissions of 14% in Sukabumi and 27% in Rembang compared to conventional farmers' technology without organic based fertiliser and plastic mulch treatments. Thus, the IPM on the chilli plantation contribute to N2O mitigation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Chlorpyrifos is a broad-spectrum insecticide and is widely used to Organism Pests Management (OPM). The remediation technology for polluted land is needed to reduce the risk of continuous impacts. The research aimed to reduce chlorpyrifos insecticide residues in shallot agriculture through remediation technology. The research was carried out in Naru Village, Sape Sub-District, Bima Regency (NTB) in June-August 2018. The experiment was designed in a randomized block design (RBD), three replications, and six treatments: (T1) farmers method, (T2) urea fertilizer-coated biochar, (T3) urea fertilizer-coated biochar enriched with consortia microbes, (T4) consortium microbes 2 L ha-1, (T5) urea fertilizer-coated nano biochar, and (T6) urea fertilizer-coated nano biochar enriched with consortia microbes. Remediation agents containing carbon, such as biochar and manure and some microbes can help accelerate the degradation of insecticides in the environment. Decreased chlorpyrifos residue from highest to low, respectively: urea fertilizer coated nano biochar>urea fertilizer coated nano biochar with enriched consortium microbes>urea fertilizer coated biochar>urea fertilizer coated biochar with enriched consortium microbes>consortium microbes 2 L ha-1. Treatment of urea fertilizer coated nano biochar and urea fertilizer coated nano biochar with enriched consortium microbes can be applied as a chlorpyrifos remediation technology in the shallot agriculture in silt texture soils. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The maize weevil is corn pests that reduce production and damages the storage quality. Therefore, pest management should simultaneously be carried out by applying all available technologies. This pest can damage up to 30% of plant productivity, not including the value of losses due to decreased quality of hazardous materials for health and safety, both as feed and feed. Aflatoxin contamination for example, can be dangerous if consumed. This paper is a desk study that reviews some literature, attempts to describe the role of cultivation technology improvement, crop protection, optimum watering, phosphate fertilization, the technology of postharvest handling, management of water content of corn kernels, sanitation, cleanliness, warehouse management, pesticide use, and fumigation in reducing the scale of damage and increasing the added value of production, and improving the quality of stored materials so that they are safe to use, both as food and feed.

abstract={The practice of increasing rice productivity in tidal swamp lands is guided by synergistic cultivation through integrated crop management (ICM). The objective of the study was to improve technology through the use of crop residue and increase rice productivity in tidal land. The superior varieties from Green Super Rice (GSR) group used was Inpari 42 and 43, combined with straw left in the land, site-specific fertilization, and dolomite application. The study was conducted from April 2017 to September 2018 in the tidal land of Belanti Siam Village. The method of participatory on farm and farmers activities involves 10 farmers on an area of 10 ha. The results proved that the application of 5 t ha-1 of straw waste remains in the land after harvesting, and the addition of 0.5 to 1 t ha-1, dolomite, were able to increase soil pH from 4.0 to 4.2. Application of the straw waste, rice productivity increased by 32% (4.8 t ha-1) after the first application and further 21% (5.1 t ha-1) after the second application for the Inpari 42 variety. The productivity levels of Inpari 43 variety increased 112% (4.8 t ha-1) and 16% (5.6 t ha-1) after the first and the second applications, respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The need of landuse planning become apparent since the lands have the opportunity to be developed. Appropriate landuse planning based on spatial land resource data management is then required, in order to achieve sustainable landuse. The objective of this study was to design and allocate appropriate agricultural land regions for land use policy through extensification and intensification programs in order to support sustainable food crops development areas. The procedure of land resource evaluation consisting of land capability evaluation (LCE) and land suitability evaluation (LSE) was applied to determine land allocation of arable lands for rice farming development. The use of geographic information system (GIS) technology was also employed not only for spatial data management but it can also be applied to support decision making within establishing landuse planning. In the case of Pulang Pisau District, land allocation for extensification and intensification regions are mainly found in southern part and mostly located at watershed areas with each total area of 380,261 ha (36.81%) and 29,941 ha (2.90%), respectively. In order to support these potential areas, specific programs can then be formulated to increase the yield and productivity for these regions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Integrated Crop Management (ICM) had been introduced in North Sumatra Province since 2002. This study aimed to explore how farmers' perception on intermittent irrigation and balanced fertilization of ICM. The assessment was obtained using cross-sectional and field survey in Serdang Bedagai and Deli Serdang Regency. Primary data were initially collected through observation toward community surrounding the watershed. The farmer respondents were selected purposively based on their roles as innovators or early adopters. Secondary data was collected from the review of previous studies. The results showed that after its first introduction in 2002, most farmers had not applied intermittent irrigation and balanced fertilization such as the use of compost and leaf colour chart (BWD) in farming practice. Farmers perception was low regarding technological characteristics that did not correspond with adoption level. High understanding on complexity, comparative advantage, and compatibility were not followed by high level of adoption, resulting innovation dissonance to occur. Farmers in downstream area were unsatisfied of irrigation institution (P3A) particularly in dry season. Therefore, it is recommended to consider institutional (P3A) approach to stimulate behaviour changes among farmers in surrounding watershed area despite hard effort to do so. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Red chili is a strategic commodity, production consistency in quality and quantity is needed. Peatland with all its limitations has the potential to be used as an area for chili crop development, but appropriate land management technology is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of using mulch and amelioration and fertilization for chili plants in peatlands during the rainy season. The research was conducted at Landasan Ulin, Banjarbaru. The treatments were: The use of mulch (without mulch and silver black plastic mulch) and a combination of inorganic and amelioration fertilizer doses (P1 = 50% model of inorganic fertilizer + 15 t ha-1 manure), P2 = 50% model of inorganic fertilizer + 30 t manure ha-1), P3 = Model 100% Inorganic Fertilizer + Manure 15 t ha-1), P4 = Model 100% Inorganic Fertilizer + Manure 30 t ha-1, P5 = Farmer Model. The results showed that the use of black silver mulch combined with 325 kg ha-1 urea, 225 kg ha-1 SP 36 and 200 kg KCl kg ha-1 KCl and 30 t ha-1a manure showed fruit yields of chili plants reached 15 t ha-1. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Geragai Agro Techno Park (ATP), Jambi Province is a pilot area to accelerate agricultural technology transfer. The ATP pilot area is built in a swampland agro-ecosystem which requires optimal land management. The purposes of this study were to identified soil chemical properties at ATP, to build partitioned canals based on hydro-topography and land characteristics, and to contribute to land management at ATP. This study was carried out using a direct survey by observing field conditions, taking and analysing soil samples, interviewing farmers, and conducting a literature study in January - December 2016. Based on the results, the soil fertility rate at ATP was in the low to the moderate category with 80 to 120 cm pyrite layer depth. Based on soil survey, hydro-topographic survey, and land characteristics, it is recommended to build partitioned canals on these lands to prevent pyrite oxidation and maintain water availability during the rainy and dry seasons. With the partitioned canal, Geragai Agro Techno Park can increase the cropping index to 300 with the rice-secondary crop-secondary crop pattern adjusted to farmer preferences. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Solok Regency in West Sumatera Province is one of the new development centers for shallot production in Indonesia. This region has a specific cultivation characteristic that is different from other shallot production centers, where the cultivation is done in the highlands throughout the year. It is estimated that there will be differences in yields and production techniques between the rainy and wet seasons. The purpose of this study was to investigate farming practices of shallot cultivation in the highland of Solok Regency during the dry and wet seasons. Survey on 95 shallot farmers in Solok Regency showed that the use of labour inputs, solid pesticides, leaf fertilizers, and adhesives was significantly different between the rainy season and the dry season. At the same time, the land area inputs, mulch use, organic fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, dolomite, and liquid pesticides were not significantly different. The productivity of each land unit in the rainy season is lower than that of the dry season. The results of this study are expected to be a reference for planning the application of integrated pest and disease management technology according to the appropriate season on the shallot commodity in the highlands of Solok Regency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={One of the advantages of ratoon technology was that the plant age becomes shorter so that it can utilize water in limited conditions. This study aimed to determine the feasibility (agronomy and economy) of cultiviting Rojolele local rice ratoon to anticipates drought. The study was conducted in the rice fields of Polaman, Argorejo, Sedayu, Bantul from May to December 2019. First planting as "Un-ratoon"treatment and second planting as "Ratoon"treatment. The un-ratoon and ratoon technology follows the Integrated Crop Management (ICM), but ratoon technology does not conduct seedbed and tillage. Morphological observations included plant height, number of productive tillers, leaf length, leaf width, panicle length, number of filled grains per panicle, number of empty grains per panicle, weight of 1,000 grains, weight of grain per hill and productivity. Observation data were analyzed using the Independent Sample T-test. An analysis of farming was carried out by calculating the B/C, R/C and MBCR (Marginal Benefit Cost Ratio). Ratoon cultivation technology was feasible to be developed because it has more than one BC ratio, RC ratio and MBCR value. With ratoon technology, period for crop maturity becomes shorter (45.66% decrease) so that it was a technological breakthrough to anticipate climate change (drought). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Sediment materials and chemical compounds contained in the wastewater of the natural stone industry have adversely affected the paddy fields in the surrounding natural stone industry in several sub-districts in Cirebon Regency. This study aims to determine the impact of natural stone industry waste on paddy fields, water, and rice plants and to provide alternative technology to reduce the impacts. The method used was field survey, laboratory analysis, and FGD. The sediment material in the natural stone industry wastewater adversely affected the physical characteristics of the soil such as structural texture, and soil permeability that could inhibit the growth and development of rice plant roots. The chemical properties of the soil is still high in productivity and the level of heavy metal contamination is still below the threshold value according to GR 82/2001. However, it is necessary to immediately take control to avoid endangering the environment either to soil, water, plants, animals, or humans. Technology alternatives that recommended to reduce the impact of natural stone industry wastewater are as follows 1). Mechanical soil treatment technology; 2). Ecological engineering through the Integrated Plant and Resource Management approach; 3). Phytoremediation and Bioremediation technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Owing to the rapid development of earth observation technology, the volume of point cloud dataset is growing rapidly. The efficient management and retrieval method is very important for effective use of the large point cloud datasets. Current methods for point cloud data management are generally based on file which makes it difficult to describe internal structure of the modelling objects, while current indexing is generally based on coordinates which is quite time-consuming for large volume cloud point data. To solve these problems, we proposed a method to manage and index point cloud data with a global grid model GeoSOT. The subdivision model of three-dimensional point cloud data was defined to identify the global position of point clouds and internal points with GeoSOT-3D grids. The management and indexing of point clouds were implemented based on the GeoSOT-3D grid codes integrated with the metadata table. A 3D prototype platform for showing the method was developed based on the Cesium. Experimental results show that our method is able to manage, query, visualize massive point clouds as well as other data sources in a unified global position framework. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Energy management is the key to China's economy prosperity and environment protection in the future. This paper makes predictions on whether China's energy 13th Five-Year plan can be achieved and the trend of energy consumption in the next stage. Aiming at the shortcoming of insufficient extraction of nonlinear features in the energy system from existing energy consumption models, and low prediction accuracy due to single models. Based on the derivation of the joint posterior distribution density function of the stationary ARMA model parameters under the Normal-gamma prior distribution, this paper proposes a Bayesian ARIMA-nonlinear regression energy consumption prediction model. Bayesian parameter estimation makes full use of prior information and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique gets rid of the tedious calculation of high-dimensional integrals. Compared with the existing model, the improved model has higher prediction accuracy. Its Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error are 3452.0294 and 0.4727%. In line with the development goals set out in the 13th Five-Year plan, an empirical study of the fluctuation law of China's total energy consumption was carried out using data on China's energy consumption from 1990 to 2019 and its factors. The results show that affected by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 epidemic, the growth rate of China's energy demand will fluctuate slightly in 2020. By the end of the 13th Five-Year plan, the total energy consumption can reach the expected goal. After the epidemic is under control, energy demand for the whole society will usher in a rebound growth. In the next five years (2020~2024), China's energy consumption will continue to maintain a steady upward trend of slowing growth. In view of these situations, this paper suggests that, on the one hand, we should attach equal importance to energy conservation and technology development to improve energy efficiency; on the other hand, we should adjust industrial structure and establish a unified energy management system to promote sustainable development of the energy industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study investigated the impact of the use of construction technology equipment on the workforce in the construction industry. This study made use of the quantitative approach. Questionnaires were sent out to construction industry professionals, such as project managers, quantity surveyors, engineers, and owners of construction companies. Data received was analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings reveal that the use of construction equipment will have a tremendous impact on the workforce as one equipment would be able to execute work that could be done by a sizeable number of labourers. It was also found that the productivity of construction projects in South Africa can be increased by making use of construction technology equipment. However, it will be a herculean task to fully adopt construction technology equipment in project execution in South Africa as respondents believe the construction industry is heavily relied upon by the government to generate employment. There is also a perceived lack of expertise and lack of knowledge regarding the use of construction technology equipment among the workforce in the construction industry of South Africa. It is therefore suggested that construction companies invest in these different equipment, which will surely assist labourers and also speed up construction projects. The government must also look for areas of the economy to create jobs instead of relying heavily on the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Potato is one of the most important food products in Russia. The total annual production of potato in Russia is ~35-40 mln. tons; this production volume is surpassed only by China and India. Nevertheless, domestic agricultural industry still can't completely meet the national consumption of potato, so every year Russia imports up to 1.5 mln. tons of potatoes. One of the reasons of such situation is that potato is very difficult crop for cultivation, since it is susceptible to a number of abiotic and biotic factors able to cause significant reduction of the yield quantity and quality. This paper is dedicated to a new approach in plant protection and demonstrates how information technologies can help us to increase the efficiency of the disease management and to reduce the negative influence of fungicides on the human health and environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The research specifies individual types of appliances - electric motors, lighting, heating, water heating and information technology in a selected newly constructed building. Construction machines with electric motors have been taken out of the itemized budget of the construction, their electric power input and time of their use have been determined. In order to determine other consumption, the equipment of a construction site, individual electrical appliances, their power input, number and time of their use have been proposed. Methods of consumption measuring and its division into the implementation costs of constructions in the way usual in the Czech Republic are presented. Furthermore the possibilities of optimizing electricity consumption costs within the project management by choosing a supplier and discussing other possible measures during the construction process have been considered. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={For high-frequency sub-images, a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to select the threshold, and the neighbourhood algorithm based on average gradient selection is used for fusion. This algorithm can effectively improve the fusion effect of fused images. The experimental research results show that combining the characteristics of gradient intensity and phase consistency, the characteristic method of compressing the information while retaining important information, which is convenient for real-time processing, is used for related research on sensor image fusion. The application of big data to stock planning will help to promote the reform of planning technology and planning subject, and help historical districts better carry out protection planning, construction implementation and operation management.

abstract={Identifying illegal intruders is a crucial issue in subway safety management. This paper performs an intrusion detection trial through distributed vibration measurements on a real underground engineering and the ultra-weak fiber optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology was adopted to glean the strucutral vibration signal of the intruder loading. The results showed that the signal model in the distributed structural vibration can be utilized to illustrate the location and speed of the intruders. Besides, the information in both time and frequency domains in the selected experimental area demonstrated that the ultra-weak FBG-based approach is able to distinguish designed intrusion cases in terms of pattern and strength. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid development of technology and economy has brought the construction industry into a stage of vigorous development. The traditional mode of project cost management is no longer suitable for the development of the construction industry, and more refined management of cost is imperative. At this stage, BIM technology is widely used in the management of cost. It can establish corresponding models to carry out fine management of each stage of construction. Based on the above background, the purpose of this paper is to refine the management of traffic engineering cost based on BIM technology. This article first conducts a survey of the current status of traffic engineering cost management based on BIM technology. Through statistical analysis of the survey data, it is mainly aimed at the investigation of the current BIM understanding and application of the traffic engineering cost industry. Then put forward the basic principles of BIM technology application engineering cost management, and then put forward the optimization plan of traffic engineering cost management based on BIM technology, including investment decision, design, budget, bidding, construction stage, etc. Finally, the study found that in the process of project construction, the application of BIM technology greatly facilitated the construction of various specialties, and the project quality rate reached more than 98%, and significant results were achieved. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The construction of traffic highway includes design, construction and operation management, which involves a variety of data and information in these processes, while the traditional highway engineering progress is shown in the form of statistical tables, charts and reports, which is difficult to be directly linked with the specific location and pile number of the project and directly displayed. BIM model provides visual project construction management in the overall planning, design, progress and other aspects. At the same time, when the project is completed, this management information will also provide important data information for the use and operation of the highway. In this paper, the application of BIM Technology in highway construction management is investigated in the form of questionnaire survey and on-site interview, which comprehensively reflects the actual situation of BIM application in highway engineering. According to the actual situation, the future BIM Technology will provide good technical support for the informatization of construction industry, which can effectively promote safe construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Climate risk in agriculture indicates the potential of climate-related hazards to impact coffee production and quality negatively. Coffee production has decreased due to changes in temperature, more extended droughts, and increased pests' invasion. Coffee agribusiness is demanded to respond to the increasing need for Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA). As a CSA model, coffee cattle integration offers farmers risk management strategies and options to adapt to climate change. However, the effectiveness of its implementation is still low due to technical and institutional constraints. The study's objectives are to analyze constraints to implement coffee cattle integration as a CSA model and formulate strategies to implement it. The analysis method used Interpretive Structural Modelling. CSA implementation constraints include input, labor, knowledge, technology, capital, and farmer institutions in crop and livestock production. Strategies for implementing coffee cattle integration, as CSA practice, is carried out in a hierarchical stage. It starts with developing a support system to improve agricultural support policies, promote public-private partnerships, and support community assistance and facilitation center, followed by the increasing availability of capital through credit farm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper aims to investigate the potential effect of vibration stress during stimulated transport and to evaluate the effect of storage's temperature and duration on weight loss, color changes, firmness, and total soluble solid of tomatoes. Vibration shaker was used to simulate the transport vibration and accelerometer was fixed on different locations inside the container. Tomatoes were divided into 2 groups where the first one stressed for 2 hrs at the frequency of 2.5Hz and the other was not vibrated as a control. All tomatoes were stored at 10 and 22 C for 10 days. Weight loss, color changes, and firmness total soluble solids (TSS) were measured. RGB acquisition system was used to measure color changes on tomato and then analysed by ImageJ software. Lightness, redness, yellowness, purity, saturation, color change and some color indices of tomato were calculated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse all obtained data. This research proves that the color, weight, firmness and total soluble solids of tomato altered by the vibration stresses and storage's temperature and duration. Advanced methods and technologies need to be studied regarding temperature storage managements and transportation facilities to reduce the rapid changes of the quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The Agroecological Zone (AEZ) is an information system to determine the potential of land resources. Based on that, the suitability of plants and their land management technology can be identified. The evaluation of land suitability of coastal areas in Tegal District was carried out using matching method between growing requirements for commodities and land characteristics of AEZ data. AEZ identification results show that the coastal area consists of three zones, namely Zone A, alluvial plains with Typic Endoaquepts and Aeric Endoaquepts soil types; Zone B, Fluvio-marine plains with Typic Endoaquepts soil types; and Zone C, coastal areas with Typic Udipsamments soil types. Based on the agroecological characteristics, the coastal area is suitable for crops development and fisheries. The suitable agricultural commodities namely rice, water melon, sugar cane and jasmine, which correspond to class 1 (S1) for zones A and B; red chilies and shallots, class 2 (S2) which is suitable for zones A and B. While zone C is identified as less suitable for food crops or horticulture, due to limiting factors such as poor oxygen availability and poor root conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Individual attributes positively influence the success of entrepreneurs, so that it is important to be learnt by potential youths' entrepreneurs by providing mentor from relevant business. To address this, we introduce Electroencephalography (EEG) or brainwave to investigate the attention and meditation level of students in entrepreneur skill and to develop an original approach to entrepreneurship learning about innovation. We constructed an integrated system of EEG brainwave in which each participant could be engaged in a virtual product design activity. The participant's creative behavior, brainwave state, and the level of creativity of their virtual product observed and recorded simultaneously to understand the creative process and their creative product were evaluated afterwards. The experiment involved 20 students of agribusiness study program from different semesters. The result of the students' exam was compared to their level of attention and meditation, then analyzed. The experiment showed that "attention"was more dominated to keep the brainwave technology work rather than to explore many entrepreneur paths explained by the teacher. Further investigation showed the difference of entrepreneur thinking's priority before and after experiment, i.e. creativity-risk taking-decision making into risk taking-creativity-decision because students had different perceptions on how to become the successful agribusiness entrepreneurs after the experiment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Technologies are tools or machines that solve real-world problems and, therefore, very important to all industries, including the construction industry. In some parts of the world, technology is a necessity as it helps to improve and increase the efficiency of day-to-day operations, especially in terms of time and budget management. However, there are still many companies that are refusing to apply technology in their construction projects. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the adoption of emerging technologies in the Malaysian construction industry. To achieve these objectives, this study analyses the extensive interview data with selected construction project managers. Nineteen factors were identified, and these factors can be categorized into two groups (internal; workable by project managers and external; uncontrollable by project managers). This work contributes to the body of knowledge in analysing the factors that affect the adoption of technology in the construction industry from industry practitioners' angle, which could help researchers and industry practitioners draw up plans to reduce the rejection of technologies among the project managers. The findings of this study could help improve the success of adopting the technologies in any part of the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Traditionally, road maintenance is conducted either using road authorities' in-house resources or method-based contracting, where contractors do the work and are paid based on predefined volume and unit prices. Nowadays, Performance-based Maintenance Contracting (PBMC) is one of the most current approaches in road maintenance works. PBMC provides contractors with freedom in design, construction methods, materials, and innovation in performing the contract as long as the standard specified is fulfilled. While PBMC implementation is increasing around the world, it can be considered new in Malaysia. This research aims to investigate the viability and practicability of PBMC's implementation for road maintenance in Malaysia. Specifically, the research's objective is to identify factors that are affecting the adoption of PBMC for road maintenance works in Malaysia. To achieve that objective, interview data from industry practitioners that are involved in managing roads are analyzed. Factors affecting PBMC's implementation for road maintenance in Malaysia can be categorized into two groups: PBMC (ex. awareness on PBMC) and Non-PBMC (ex. contractor's integrity) related factors. The findings of this research would help policymakers, industry practitioners, and researchers improve the success of implementing PBMC in the facility management industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Recycling addresses environmental issues associated with solid waste by minimizing overall resource consumption and environmental impact. In the construction industry, concrete recycling is crucial because concrete is the most dominant waste of construction and demolition waste. However, its implementation is at a low level in numerous countries, including Malaysia because project managers refuse to adopt concrete recycling in practice. Detailed information is needed to find the obstacle to recycle concrete waste, including often neglected small construction projects. This study's objective is to identify factors that are affecting decisions in adopting concrete recycling from project managers' perspective. Nine barriers to implementing concrete recycling in Malaysia are identified. The nine barriers can be associated with facilities, the workforce, quality, financial, technologies, and resources.

abstract={Cold chain logistics is a low temperature supply chain system that combines the refrigeration industry and logistics. Refrigerated transportation, cold storage, cold chain connection points and other auxiliary activities will cause a certain amount of energy consumption, and related technologies, management, equipment and facilities, Cold storage layout, etc. are all factors that affect energy consumption. Based on this research background, the research on the energy rebound effect of cold chain logistics is based on three aspects: definition, mechanism and empirical test. Based on the endogenous economic growth model, labour-enhancing technological progress and material cold chain logistics are introduced. Based on the assumption of long-term changes in capital, by constructing an invariable substitution elastic function, a theoretical model of the energy rebound effect of cold chain logistics is established, and the calculation formula for the energy rebound effect of cold chain logistics in the long and short term is obtained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the context of energy conservation and environmental protection, new wind energy power generation has obvious random, intermittent, uncontrollable and anti-peak-shaving characteristics. The large-scale grid connection of wind power has brought grid peaking and stable and safe operation the huge pressure has caused more serious wind curtailment and power rationing, which has seriously affected the effective use of wind resources and economic benefits. Under the dispatch of the energy management system, the all-vanadium redox flow battery energy storage power station smooths the output power of wind power generation, and cooperates with the wind farm power forecast system to improve the wind farm tracking planned power generation capacity and improve the grid-connected power quality of the wind farm. Based on this, the thesis studied the external operating characteristics of the all-vanadium flow battery (VFB) energy storage system, and carried out the modeling and simulation of the energy storage system (ESS) based on the electrochemical properties of the VFB. Systematically analyse the actual operating data of the energy storage system and evaluate the impact of its overload operation on dispatch control, and fit key parameters such as state of charge (SOC), electromotive force and equivalent resistance, and obtain functional relationships. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of refined power grid investment, power grid companies pay more attention to investment benefits and effects while taking into account reliability. However, in the practice of project evaluation, there are problems of "emphasis on results and neglect of transformation", "emphasis on long-term and neglect on short-term", poor objectivity and low accuracy of economic benefit evaluation. According to the characteristics of science and technology projects, the concept, scope and time scale of the post-evaluation of power grid science and technology projects are defined. On the basis of the existing State Grid Corporation's project post-evaluation, an evaluation index and a mid- and long-term evaluation system were established to comprehensively evaluate the investment benefits of scientific and technological projects and improve the evaluation mechanism of current evaluation indicators. This paper also digs out the guiding indicators of evaluation, and takes the economic benefits of result transformation as an important evaluation indicator to guide project implementers to improve project quality during project implementation, thereby improving the efficiency and benefits of scientific research project investment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={High-quality power equipment is the basis for ensuring the safe operation of the power grid and improving the reliability of power supply. In actual operation, although some electrical equipment can continue to be used, abnormal operation or hidden dangers will affect the safety of people, equipment and power grid, reliable and economic operation of power grid and equipment, equipment output or life span, and power quality. Therefore, research on multi-dimensional analysis of the same batch of substation equipment, and identification of suspected family defects and frequent defects is of great significance for improving the company's equipment management and defect management. The maturity and promotion of unstructured text data mining, graph computing technology, and semantic analysis have provided a wider dimensional space for the analysis of power equipment defect data. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional defect data analysis, this article summarizes and analyzes the defects and hidden dangers found in the equipment, traces the distribution status of the same equipment through the physical "ID", carries out multi-dimensional analysis of the same batch of equipment, and investigates the hidden dangers of equipment family defects. A big data analysis algorithm to build automatic identification models of suspected familial defects and frequent defects in main substation equipment such as transformers, disconnectors, circuit breakers, and use graph computing technology to quickly integrate analysis capabilities in multi-source heterogeneous data fusion with hidden relationship discovery capabilities, identify equipment defects with potential impact relationships. From historical data, discover which manufacturers or purchased batches of equipment are more likely to have the same defect, and which defect types have a higher frequency, improve the recognition model of family defects and frequent defects, and improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of defect recognition. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Uncontrolled infrastructure development may produce excessive carbon emission and scarcity of natural resources. The reuse of waste materials in general promotes material ecology and the cradle to cradle concept. The utilisation of industrial waste in the development of advanced materials promoting the extensive research on sustainable building components. The main objective of this research is to investigate the potential of utilising local industrial waste, Solid Waste Fly Ash (SWFA) and Paint Sludge (PS) as target material in replacing laterite soil that is non-renewable natural resources. Standard industrial size bricks were fabricated consist the combination of Laterite Clay, SwFA and PS (SWPS) at 50:25:25 ratios. The results for engineering and environmental properties were within the acceptable of engineering standards and performances. This test result suggests potential used of SwFA and Paint Sludge as substitute to clay for unfired brick. This will certainly contribute to the recycling of SwFA and industrial sludge (Paint Sludge and possibly others) and hence to minimise the impact of these by-product to the environment if send to landfill. The manufacture of unfired bricks can exploit locally available waste materials and can be used in certain applications of low load bearing situation. This research also suggests innovation and enhanced waste management and contribution towards the concept of green building components. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper examines the influence of non-traditional raw materials of plant origin on the formation of consumer properties of functional butter cookies. It considers the biological value and balance of wheat and spelt flour. It scientifically proves that the lysine content (the most deficient essential amino acid) is significantly higher in spelt flour than in wheat flour. The analysis of organoleptic and physicochemical properties provided a basis for determination and scientific substantiation of the composition of butter cookies. It is found that it is technologically possible to use 40% of spelt flour of the total flour weight and 4% of barley malt extract. This dosage ensures high consumer properties of the products. It was proved that cookies with spelt flour and barley malt extract have higher quality characteristics during the entire shelf-life, as compared to the control samples. It was found that new potentially healthy ingredients of plant origin can enrich butter cookies with minerals, protein and some essential amino acids, enhancing the nutritional and biological value of the finished products. The results obtained in this paper have practical significance for improving the biscuit baking technology, namely, for enhancing its nutritional and biological value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article proposes a new fish product and process design approach, which includes qualimetry approaches (the property tree, a comprehensive method of qualimetric assessment, qualimetric scaling, expert qualimetry, qualimetric forecasting) and up-to-date quality management methods (ISO 9000, causal diagram, Quality Function Deployment-QFD), safety methods (ISO 22000, decision tree) as well as the results of the practical application of the new approach. The nomenclature of indicators of consumer requirements for the quality of fish cakes and the mandatory requirements of regulatory documentation have been identified, the most popular fish cakes brands among consumers have been identified, and the values of the most important indicators of the quality of fish cakes required by consumers are predicted: protein content (at least 17%), shelf life (12 months), a decrease in fat content (not more than 2.5%) and a price (not more than 50 rubles); moisture content ≤ 85%; the absence of pathogenic microorganisms as well as of artificial food additives and preservatives, the content of healthful functional components of non-synthetic origin. The recipe and production technology of fish cakes with the indicated properties have been developed. Measures have been taken to ensure the safety of the new product and five critical control points (CCP) have been identified, namely, raw material acceptance, weight mixing, frying fish cakes, freezing fish cakes, storage and sale of finished products. The analysis of experimental samples of fish cakes showed their advantage over analogues. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The work focuses on analyzing the modern process control systems in the food and agricultural industries for improving management quality. Computer simulation of the control systems with a network channel for transmitting information was carried out for various volumes of data buffers for system elements. The subject of the investigation is to study the effect of data buffering on the quality of process control for systems with a limited buffer volume for data packets. It is assumed that the transmission of a data packet over a network channel during the quantization period is carried out with a given probability. If the data packet from the digital sensor is not transmitted in one quantization cycle to the controller, then it is placed in the sensor buffer. When data is transmitted over the channel, all packets from the sensor buffer are transferred to the controller buffer. The controller processes the incoming data from the buffer sequentially-one packet per quantization cycle. For simulate such situations, it was proposed to use the corresponding developed random processes. The innovation of the developed simulation models is in the fact that the development of the simulation models is based on modelling the time gap of the information data stream. Modelling the functioning of the network control system was carried out in the Simulink environment of the Matlab system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The economic sector of sugar production from beets in Russia is currently operating in a crisis of overproduction. The volume of sugar produced over the past few years exceeds the demand of the country's population and the need for related processing industries. This economic situation led to a decrease in the market price of sugar, the formation of a deficit of working capital of enterprises. It arose a risk for unprofitable work of sugar factories. One of the main business processes that determine the efficiency of the company's operation is to make a profit. Based on the analysis of the specifics of sugar production from beets, a mathematical model of the sugar factory's profit was developed. The developed model takes into account all the components of the business process of making a profit that determine the efficiency of the sugar factory. Based on the developed mathematical model, it is possible to analyze the break-even operation of a sugar factory and determine the break-even point. The obtained mathematical model allows solving problems of optimal enterprise management, optimal design and reconstruction of sugar plants, and conducting financial audits. With the help of the developed mathematical model, the production activity of three sugar factories of different production capacities and different degrees of technical equipment is studied. The economic parameters of break-even operation of the studied enterprises are determined. Comparative analysis has shown the decisive role of effective production technologies in the break-even value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The article deals with scientifically based specialized food product formulation under conditions of agriculture digitization. It characterizes the formulation components and their synergetic properties in terms of prolonged anti-oxidant body protection. The authors have developed a new skeleton method of innovative food product pelleting, which ensures its long shelf life and its functional components efficacy. The innovative production technology of new pellet-filled capsules allows programmed release of active substances from a tablet skeleton at specific time and in specific order. It also eliminates oxygen exposure, which, along with low moisture content, prevents oxidative and hydrolytic processes. This technology as well as favorable production parameters provides high usability properties of the product and stability of its biologically active ingredients. The authors determined the product nutrition value, which characterizes the product functional properties. These functional properties are confirmed by field studies. Development of a new specialized product formula and its production technology under conditions of agriculture digitization result in a wider range of functional products, a safer, more effective and useful high quality product, intake of which prevents alimentary diseases development and improves both overall health and working capacity. It is important to note that the new product is certified in accordance with the requirements of international standards of the ISO 9001: 2000 series and GMP rules.

abstract={The food systems of the Plekhanov Russian Economic University studied in detail. For comparison, studies on the other six leading universities in Moscow and data on many large foreign universities are presented. The demand for healthy nutrition in most universities and the development of a customer services network in them has been established. These problems are especially acute in the field of human nutrition, namely in the university nutrition system. Therefore, the authors studied the market situation with the demand for food services in universities (Russian and foreign). Surveys, questioning of a youth audience were carried out in order to ascertain the quality of culinary dishes and products, the level of service, assortment, methods of selling food and culinary products. In terms of improving the nutritional system of universities, it seems the best option for using vending sales, pizza and other innovations. However, problems were identified in the service of vending machines. Therefore, their most rational placement is necessary. Besides, it is necessary to form the required range of products and the related tasks of portioning, packaging, and logistics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Winter Camelina (Camelina sylvestris) is an oilseed crop of the Brassicaceae family, the oil of which is used in various industries. Sowing dates and sowing rates have a significant impact on the productivity of camelina in the arid conditions of Black Sea region. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of sowing dates and sowing rates on the duration of the growing season, field germination, winter hardiness and yield structure in Black Sea region. The agroclimatic resources of Black Sea region allow the successful introduction of winter camelina, which is distinguished by their broad agroecological resistance to biotic and abiotic stress factors. The Penzyak variety of winter camelina is well adapted in the zone and is able to form a satisfactory yield in a wide calendar range. By correcting certain technology elements taking into account meteorological conditions, it is possible to create prerequisites for a more complete realization of the potential productivity of culture. The length of the growing season of camelina in the Black Sea region is from 179 to 269 days, depending on the sowing period and weather conditions. The winter hardiness of winter camelina in the Black Sea region depends on the sowing period: when sowing on September 15 and 30 and on October 15 it is high and reaches 92-100%. The winter hardiness of the late sowing season depends on the prevailing weather conditions in the winter: in some years it can be high (98-99%), but in the years when bulging and blowing of plants by the wind is manifested, it decreases to 44-49% when sowing on October 30, and to 20% when sowing on November 15. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The rationale for the present study is explained by the need of Russian and foreign agricultural producers in high-protein feed preservation efficiency increase and nutrients loss decrease, as well as implementation of energy-saving technologies. Currently, there is lack of research data on utilization of chemical and bacterial agents for silage preservation. There is no definite opinion on vacuum influence on fermentation processes during ensilaging and on qualitative parameters of silage. The aim of the study was to give grounds for technological processes of biocombined chemical conservant Tecacid and biological agent Biosil-NN utilization, as well as improvement of Eastern galega conservation technology for increase of qualitative parameters and energy management efficiency. Laboratory and production trials, performed during this study, showed that optimal and most efficient approach was silage two-phase combined treatment with Tecacid (1.5 L/ton) and Biosil-NN (1 L/40 ton). Consecutive processing of galega forage ensilaging contributed to increase of fermentation quality and preservation of nutrients regardless of anaerobiosis production techniques. When vacuum sealing was used instead of conventional method of sealing, total content of acids, including lactic and oleic, decreased, which improved fermentation quality. Materials of this article are of practical value for feed producers involved in high-protein silage preservation, because the obtained results proved high efficiency of two-phase combined application of chemical and bacterial agents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A stationary experiment presented the data on the effect of optimal and increased doses of organic and mineral fertilizers against the background of various tillage systems on productivity, quality and soil fertility of the southern chernozems of the steppe zone of Russia. The rotation of crops was as follows: complete fallow - winter wheat - winter barley - corn for green fodder - winter wheat - fallow occupied (Vika panonskaya + winter wheat) - winter wheat - spring barley - sunflower. The soil of the experimental plot is represented by southern low humus chernozem on loess like light clays, the humus horizon is up to 40-50 cm. The optimal fertilizer doses, irrespective of the method of cultivating the soil, increased the yield of grain crops of the crop rotation from 4.2 to 9.7 centners per hectare, green mass of corn and Wiko-wheat mixture by 15.2 and 48.5 centners per hectare, respectively. The glassiness of the grain in the control on average was 44.8%, the generally accepted dose of fertilizing increased it by 7%. Accordingly, the amount of raw gluten also increased with control - 23.9%, 28.7, and 30%. Therefore, the optimal fertilizer doses affected the quality indicators, and a 1.5-fold increase in the dose increased the wheat grain quality indicators by only 0.7-0.9 times. The amount of protein in the grain of winter wheat and winter barley, spring barley increased with fertilizer from 10.1 to 12.7%. According to the fallow precursor (complete and seeded), higher quality indicators were obtained in comparison with non-steam precursors. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The processing of biowaste by fly larvae Hermetia illucens is a unique technology for recycling products of human life. Fly larvae grown from biological waste can be a suitable raw material in animal feed production. During the analysis of references it was found that H. illucens is not a pest, so cultivation of this plant species does not require increased precautions. This species is not classified as potentially invasive for Russia and is not listed as a quarantine species. This insect currently has an almost cosmopolitan distribution (except in cold regions) and no significant adverse environmental impacts have been identified for it. The production of H. illucens larvae has been found to have much less environmental impact (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) than production of other protein feeds of animal origin. The production of H. illucens larvae may serve the purposes of sustainable development of the Russian agroindustrial complex. The industrial cultivation of H. illucens requires compliance with generally accepted safety measures to prevent people from swallowing the eggs of this insect. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Recycling of biowaste is accompanied by its transformation into an economic product, while at the same time contributing to the protection of the environment and bringing benefits to public health. This article provides an overview of modern technologies for processing biowaste associated with their direct use, biological, thermochemical and physical-chemical processing. Direct use technologies include land use, feed, and direct combustion. The main options for biological treatment are composting, vermicomposting, and fermentation. Physical and chemical treatment includes transesterification, compaction, and thermochemical-pyrolysis, liquefaction, gasification. Sustainable recycling of biowaste requires a sufficient amount of waste as input and market demand for the products produced. For biowaste, such markets will depend on the end-use of the product. Not all the presented methods contribute to the preservation of the environment, so the search for environmentally friendly and at the same time cost-effective technologies is currently continuing. It is aimed at combining various biowaste processing technologies into a single system that has new advantages, taking into account productivity, resource intensity and environmental friendliness. Many scientists agree that the future of waste disposal is in nature-like technologies, because nature has all the necessary recycling mechanisms. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Carbon emission from construction engineering is one of the main sources of environmental pollution. Complicated geological conditions, imperfect construction technology, and inattentive management in construction are the reasons of battered piles. The extant solutions to battered piles focus on bearing capacity, lower cost and convenience in engineering, rather than carbon emissions, as well as the requirements of environmental protection. This paper, through a contrastive analysis of carbon emissions in different solutions, concludes that the approach of prestressed pipe pile with concrete floor can significantly reduce carbon emissions to one third of its counterpart approaches. Carbon emission database for accurate calculation should be built to optimize construction projects. This paper provides a feasible solution to treat battered piles in a environment-friendly way. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, prefabricated buildings have developed rapidly because of their high efficiency and time saving, but the large consumption of resources has also led to many environmental problems. In order to explore the impact of prefabricated buildings on the environment, the environmental impact assessment of the prefabricated buildings based on Life Cycle Assessment Theory (LCA) and Willingness to Pay Theory (WTP) was carried out. First of all, this article combines field research and literature research, using BIM modeling methods to obtain the engineering quantity of prefabricated and cast-in-place buildings. Secondly, analyzing the whole process of the two construction modes based on the life cycle theory, calculate and obtain the consumption list. Next, the ReCiPe method is used to evaluate the environmental impact of prefabricated buildings, and five types of midpoint environmental impact assessment results are obtained: greenhouse gas emissions, fine particulate matter generation, acid gas emissions, energy and mineral resource consumption, etc. Finally, based on the theory of WTP, all kinds of environmental effects are unified for comparative analysis. The results show that the environmental load of the prefabricated construction method is greater than that of the cast-in-place method. It is necessary to further improve the standardization in the production technology and management methods to obtain more advantageous environmental performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Irrigation system management in the Belitang Irrigation System has some constraint that can be overcome by conducting irrigation modernization. Before implementing irrigation modernization, an irrigation system should be assessed to determine the level of irrigation modernization readiness stated by the readiness index of irrigation modernization (IKMI). The assessment of irrigation pillars was carried out in three regions including Belitang I, Belitang II and Belitang III. This study aimed to analyze the readiness of irrigation modernization in the Belitang Irrigation System and to determine the order of irrigation modernization development in three regions. Data was collected using 2 methods, namely walk through survey for irrigation infrastructure pillars and interviews for 4 other pillars including water availability, system management, institution and human resources. The assessment data was recapitulated and processed to obtain the IKMI. Then, decision making for the order of irrigation modernization development was conducted by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The result of determining the IKMI was 69.05, so Belitang Irrigation System was categorized as less ready for modernization. This showed that the irrigation modernization needs to be postponed and the irrigation system is improved for 1-2 years. Furthermore, the results of the AHP analysis showed that the order of order of irrigation system development and improvement for irrigation modernization started from the Region of Belitang III, then Belitang I and Belitang II. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Indonesian agriculture development requires the effort to accelerate adoption of innovation and increase farm productivity. One approach through farmers corporation's development had been carried out by the Assessment Institute of Agricultural Technology (AIATs). This study aimed to identify the performance of advisory innovation and to formulate alternative models for accelerating the adoption process. The research was conducted from June to December 2019 through e-survey addressed to the implementing team in 33 provinces (64 respondents), and qualitative data collections in four provinces. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Square. The results showed that advisory activities have referred to government regulations by prioritizing locations and commodities. Implementation of advisory activities were still focused on improving cultivation and post-harvest technology, and did not address specifically on institutional innovation to build farmers corporations. Characteristics of advisory activities varied among locations, relating to the budget allocation. There was an increase in adoption and diffusion innovations, and farm productivity. The role of AIATs has not been seen in the development of a broader scale. Fit model (AVE > 0.5 and CR > 0.7) in advisory showed the importance of improved internal management at AIATs, the need for synchronizing programs, and the policy support. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Bedadung watershed is one of the largest watersheds in Jember Regency. The Bedadung watershed in upstream area is generally hilly with steep slopes, so it is prone to landslides and potential to erosion. The upstream area is a protected forest that functions as a water catchment area, turning into plantation and production forest to become the target of logging and deforestation. Conservation activities in the upstream watershed area is essential in the management of water resources. Natural resource management activities in the upstream area significantly affect the success of efforts to provide water and control water resources downstream damage. This study aimed to identify conservation activities in the upstream Bedadung watershed and the impact of changes in upstream land use on environmental damage. The conservation activities in the Jompo, Antrokan, Rempangan, and Rembangan Sub-watersheds is coffe plantation, cover crop, forestry, terrace, restoration, bush, grassland. The highest increase in land change in the four sub-watersged was irrigated land / field, while the decrease was non-irrigated land. The results of comparisons between the 2001 RBI map with the 2015 Landsat Image show an 8% forest loss and 7% increase in irrigated fields. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Cocoa plantations at Aceh Timur regency face many problems in its management. Currently, there is not yet existing condition data of cocoa plantations so that it becomes obstacles in management to achieve cocoa plantations sustainibilility. This research is aim to identify key factors of ecology aspect impact towards plantations management sustainability of people's cocoa at Aceh Timur Regency. The method used in this study is to intergrate descriptive qualitative approach, quantitatif and analysis system Rap-kakaoatim approach constitutes modification of Multidimensional Scalling (MDS). MDS utilized to assess sustainability status indexs and key factors that give lack influence of sustainability in people's cocoa plantations management. The analysis result shows that status people's cocoa plantations management is lack of sustainability by ecology dimension and institutional, from the side of economy is adequate sustainability, and with socio cultural dimension is extremely sustainable. From ecology dimension, key factor that influence people's cocoa plantations sustainability are cocoa plantations rejuvenation, shade plantations and HPT attack. Those three factors are able to give positive effect towards cocoa plantations production if its condition inclines however on the contrary it can decline cocoa plantation production if its existence decreases. To intensify sustainability indexs of ecology aspect can be carried out by insentive distribution to the farmers of cocoa and Field School Program PHT (SLPHT) for controlling HPT. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The application of production management is very important in farming, this is reflected in the farming of red chili as one of the contributing commodities to inflation in Indonesia. chili is a commodity that has the most fluctuating price movements, where the price indicator is a reference for a farmer in planting red chili, therefore a farmer must be able to determine the time and carry out production management, one of which is the efficiency of production factors where this efficiency ultimately affects the the amount of income received by farmers. The purpose of this study is to determine what factors affect production, factors that have been economically efficient and factors that affect income in the red chili farming in Pidie Jaya Regency. This study uses Cobb Douglas efficiency analysis and income analysis. The factors that influence the production of red chilli farming in Bandar Baru and Trienggadeng Districts in Pidie Jaya Regency consist of seeds, compost, NPK, urea, KCL, TSP, pesticides and labor where the magnitude of the influence of the variable reaches 94.9%. The efficiency of production factors, namely compost, and KCL are not efficient, so it needs to reduce production factors, while seeds, NPK, urea, TSP, pesticides and labor are not efficient so need the addition of production factors. The influence of the factors of the amount of production, the selling price of red chili and production costs to the income of the farming of red chili in the District of Bandar Baru and the District of Trienggadeng in the District of Pidie Jaya that is equal to 91.90%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Water stress is a major factor affecting rice production. Water stress causes changes in physiology and morphology for plant tolerance to water stress. In this study, six varieties were examined for their tolerance to water stress. The check varieties for comparisons of tolerant, moderate tolerant and sensitivity to water stress, namely Situ Patenggang, Towuti and IR 64; while the test varieties in this study are three Aceh rice traditional varieties. Water stress significantly influences the number of tillers, length of internode, proline, chlorophyll a, b and the total content, leaf rolling, drying score and leaf recovery, in which the changes occur varies among varieties, in vegetative stages. Chlorophyll is the main indicator of rice tolerance to drought in the early season of the rice growing season. Varieties that have good adaptation to water stress are able to maintain their chlorophyll content. Leaf rolling, drying score and recovering from water stress show a small difference between three comparative varieties and three rice traditional varieties of Aceh in vegetative stage. To overcome water stress, it is necessary to change rice cultivation by adjusting planting time, planting season, using water stress tolerant varieties, traditional varieties and national superior varieties; changes in irrigation and fertilization management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A research has been conducted on the utilization of Lactobacillus plantarum and different heating temperatures on the quality of fermented goat milk The characteristic of milk which is easily damaged requires an effort of good management, one of them is through the technology of heating and fermentation. The research was done through completely randomized factorial design in which there were two treatment given, including a1 = pasteurization (temperature of 72° C for 15 seconds), a2 = sterilization (temperature of 121° C for 1 second), and level of Lactobacillus plantarum (factor B), b1 (L. plantarum 2.5%), b2 (L. plantarum 5%), and b3 (L. plantarum 7.5%). Parameters measured were the level of protein, pH value, and the total of lactic acid bacteria. Data obtained were then processed statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA). If there is significant difference, then it will be continued by Duncan's Multiple Range Test. The result showed that the heating temperature did not give any effect on the level of protein of the fermented milk with different levels of starter Lactobacillus plantarum. However, the protein level of milk pasteurized was higher than the protein level of milk sterilized. Furthermore, the treatment significantly affected (P<0.05) on pH value at the range of 4.017 - 4.197 and it obtained that there was interaction between the two treatment factors. The multiple result also showed that the heating temperature significantly affected (P<0.01) the total of lactic acid bacteria, while the level of Lacttobacillus plantarum significantly affected (P<.0.05) the total of lactic acid bacteria.

abstract={The study aimed to evaluate the quality of fermented virgin coconut oil (FVCO) treated under microwave heating. The FVCO was produced by local farmer from Aceh Besar District, the province of Aceh, Indonesia. A home microwave oven Samsung ME731K at frequency of 2,450MHz was used to heat 100ml of FVCO for 10 minutes. The experimental was designed by the variation of microwave power at 4 levels i.e. 0, 300, 450, and 600W. The parameters assessed were temperature, moisture, free fatty acid (FFA), and peroxide value (PV). The data was analysed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results showed that the quality of FVCO still could not be improved yet where most of parameters observed did not meet the quality standard of VCO. However, the challenge of using microwave heating to improve the FVCO quality is quite big since the treatment had significantly influenced the FVCO temperature. Further study is highly recommended to treat the FVCO under microwave heating with the improvement in the procedure of observation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Cocoa development presently has been constrained by the lack of human resources in technology application and farming management. High competence in technical, managerial and social aspects are needed to achieve high farming performance showed by farming sustainability. This paper aims to analyse the factors influencing farmer competence in implementing good agricultural practices on cocoa production and cocoa farming sustainability. Research was conducted in Pidie Jaya and Southeast Aceh, Indonesia in June - October 2019. Data and information were gathered from 352 cocoa farmers by survey methods. The results showed that farmers have high competence but cocoa farming sustainability is low. Factors that significantly affected farmer competence were farmers' characteristics, the effectiveness of extension services and the level of farmers' internet literacy. The factors that had direct and significant effects on cocoa farming sustainability were farmer competencies, the level of farmer adaptation to environmental changes and institutional support. The strategy of developing farmers' competencies can be done through increasing the effectiveness of extension services and widening farmers' access to the internet and skill in utilizing the internet to develop knowledge and skills in the application of technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Currently, Banda Aceh has been dealing with several problems related to pollution caused by domestic wastewater. According to previous studies, shallow groundwater and surface water in Banda Aceh have been contaminated by domestic wastewater produced by the community. The settlement scale off-site system with communal-WWTP operating in several villages has not function optimally in treating domestic wastewater. The problem also caused by service coverage which is still very small (only 2.12% of the total population). Therefore, it is require an acceleration of service improvement, by developing urban scale off-site system with centralized-WWTP and a wider pipe line network system. Moreover, further investigations are needed to develop the concept of planning as a preliminary design in the management of urban scale off-site system. This paper aims to develop a concept of domestic wastewater management using an urban scale off-site system that considers environmental characteristics in Banda Aceh as an alternative to mitigate the occurrence of water body pollution by domestic wastewater. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the continuous development of electric vehicle charging facilities, the impact of electric vehicles on the power grid is growing. Considering the automatic demand response technology of smart grid, charging pile operators participate in the demand response plan and guide users to charge according to the price signal or incentive mechanism, which can ensure the safety of the power grid and reduce the negative effects of electric vehicles on the grid influence. Based on the theory of demand side response elasticity, this paper analyzes the whole process of electric vehicle users' participation in demand response and its influencing factors, classifies electric vehicle users based on demand response, and then quantitatively analyzes users' demand response from the perspective of electricity price elasticity and consumption psychology. Finally, the demand side response model with user participation is established. The application of the model can effectively improve the enthusiasm of electric vehicle users to participate in demand side response, and reduce the negative impact of electric vehicles on the power grid. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={With the rapid development of renewable energy, energy storage battery technology has made great progress, and it has also caused the rapid development of electric vehicles. There is an inevitable difference between a large number of battery cells in the energy storage battery pack of electric vehicles. This difference will increase with time, and ultimately affect the safe operation of electric vehicles. Aiming at the problem of voltage imbalance in series battery packs, an improved balanced topology based on energy storage inductors is proposed. The basic working principle of the active balanced topology is analyzed, and the charging and discharging process of the balanced topology is theoretically derived. Finally, the simulation model of the balanced control during the charging and discharging process of the battery pack is built using MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that the battery pack has a good balance effect during charging and discharging, which can provide an effective solution to the balance problem of series battery packs. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={With the rapid development of rural urbanization, ecological problems have become increasingly serious, so the protection of ecological land is very important. Using vector images from 2010 to 2014 in Jizhou District, Tianjin City, supported by GIS technology, the land use types in Jizhou District, Tianjin City are divided into three categories: cultivated land, construction land and ecological land, and the ecological land is divided into three categories. It is divided into five categories: plantation land, forest land, grassland, water area and water conservancy facility land, and unused land, using methods such as ecological land area change rate and land use transfer matrix model to conduct research and analysis. Studies have shown that the ecological land in Jizhou District of Tianjin has been decreasing year by year in the past five years, and most of the ecological land has been transformed into construction land; the amount of woodland has changed the most drastically, the land for plantation has changed the fastest, while the amount of unused land has shown an overall upward trend. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={In the development of high-speed railway construction, the high-speed railway construction scheme and technology are constantly improved. Nowadays, the high-speed railway construction mainly relies on the traffic organization of the railway to organize the transportation of prefabricated components and carry out hoisting. In the process of traffic operation organization of railway engineering, the construction company often faces many safety risks. Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze the influence mechanism of various risk factors on the operation and safety of Railway Engineering and put forward corresponding suggestions. In this paper, through literature analysis and expert interviews, nine key factors are selected. The safety risk factors are divided from four dimensions of personnel, machinery, management and environment.

abstract={Bed stability is directly related to sediment resuspension and internal pollutant release, which provide an important physical basis for natural water internal pollution control. Contaminated sediment will release accumulated pollutants into the overlying water because of the instability of the riverbed and become a potential source of internal pollution. In this paper, the influence of contaminated sediment backfill technology (CSBT), i.e., the calcination of dredged sediment into ceramsite after dewatering and pollutant fixation, followed by backfilling to the dredged area, on bed stability was investigated through flume experiments. Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) was used to measure the hydrodynamic characteristics in the flume. The results show that CSBT can increase bed stability and make the water-sediment interface clear. In addition, the porosity increased after backfilling ceramsite, increasing the effective expansion of oxygen. This study provides a new idea for river and lake ecological management and environmental restoration. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={Environmental sustainability has become the key index to evaluate the success of supply chain management. This paper aims at the problem of joint emission reduction in supply chain with government subsidies under the Cap-and-Trade mechanism(C&T). Three mathematical models considering green technology investment and two subsidy methods are constructed. It is found that government subsidies cannot ensure that enterprises reduce total carbon emissions. Compared with subsidies based on green investment costs, subsidies based on emission reduction have greater emission reductions, but the total carbon emissions are also greater. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={The safety maintenance of operating site is important for safety management in power system. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and popularization of monitoring camera, face recognition technology is widely utilized in operating site of power system. To improve the capability for safety management of operating site in power system, a face recognition model based on convolutional neural network (CNN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and model fusion is built. Firstly, pre-processed images are input into CNN to obtain the recognition probabilities of various face and the extracted face features. Secondly, the extracted features of CNN are input into XGBoost to obtain the recognition probabilities of various face recognized by XGBoost. Finally, above two groups of probabilities are weighted by model fusion technology to obtain the final recognition probabilities of various face, and the final face recognition results are output. Simulation results show that CNN has better capability of feature extraction, and the proposed face recognition model has the highest recognition accuracy among those advanced face recognition models. In addition, this paper describes the application based on the proposed face recognition model in non-working personnel recognition, trajectory tracking of operators, etc, so as to greatly improve the safety management of operating site in power system, which not only ensures safety, but also reduces unnecessary management expenses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid development of my country's construction industry, people's requirements for construction quality and safety control are becoming more and more stringent. However, the results are often unsatisfactory, and the cost risk in civil engineering construction still cannot be effectively controlled. This article aims to study the risk control analysis of civil engineering costs based on BIM technology. This article analyzes the experiment from the perspective of quantification. The Experimental Integration Facility Engineering Center has conducted research on multiple BIM projects and learned about the actual operation status of these projects. Then summarize the actual effect of BIM technology. Experimental data shows that the use of BIM technology can improve the quality of design, quickly determine project cost, control design changes, avoid rework, and reduce costs. The experimental results show that the use of BIM can reduce the time used to estimate the cost to 35%, the accuracy of the estimate is controlled to <5%; the extra-budgetary changes are reduced to 70%; through the discovery and resolution of conflicts, the contract price is reduced by 13%; The project time has been reduced by 10%, and investment income can be obtained relatively quickly. Therefore, the research on construction hazard management and control based on BIM technology can not only promote the development of BIM information technology, but also make up for the inefficient and imperfect defects of hazard management and control, and greatly improve the cost risk of civil engineering. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={My country's economic pillar industry is the civil construction industry. With the rapid development of our country, modern buildings have greatly increased the difficulty of construction project management due to complex construction techniques and long construction periods. Therefore, we must improve the traditional. In this way, the management model can better improve engineering efficiency. This article is based on the BIM technology of the civil construction management engineering efficiency path to study, the experiment uses the analytic hierarchy process to determine the weights, in order to evaluate the BIM technology of construction engineering safety management. Three local survey units were selected for the experiment, and the survey form was distributed to each unit according to the experimental procedures and requirements. When handing over the BIM model, it could give the acceptance conclusion of the model. Experimental data shows that the incidence of accidents at the entrance of the cave and the border is the highest, which is the most difficult point in construction safety management. Effective measures should be taken to reduce the occurrence of accidents. The experimental results show that the following problems in BIM application have led to a reduction in the efficiency of civil construction management engineering: 85% of BIM standards are unfamiliar, 79% of BIM technology costs are overused, BIM technology is poorly applied 82%, and BIM-related software is not applied. Mature accounted for 78%, and BIM related management methods accounted for 80%. The use of BIM technology can provide an effective way to improve the efficiency of construction project management. This article conducts in-depth research on BIM technology, hoping to make a meager effort in related fields. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The construction and management of airport asphalt pavement project has the characteristics of large construction scale, high technology, many professionals involved, and high quality requirements. The traditional monitoring and management method that relies on manual on-site inspections and records is vulnerable to many factors such as environmental conditions and the ability of the implementer. It is difficult to ensure real-time monitoring of construction quality and data backtracking. With the rapid development of various advanced technologies such as global navigation satellite system(GNSS), geographic information system(GIS) and internet of things(IoT), digital construction monitoring and management technology for airport asphalt pavement has emerged as the times require. Digital construction technology is implemented through professional testing equipment, data collection, data integration, and system installation. It covers the entire construction process of airport asphalt pavement from the background management of the mixing plant, the transportation management of vehicles to the field management of paving and compaction. The technology monitors the construction quality, guarantees the construction progress, improves management efficiency, and saves costs, which has great social and economic benefits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In modern conditions, a very important issue to ensure sustainable development is the constant implementation of innovation activity. Taking into account the high cost of energy carriers, the implementation of innovative energy saving activity is a very important issue. In this paper, the authors have simulated the process of intellectual support for management decisions to determine the sources of funding for innovative energy saving activity. The proposed mathematical model allows to use the concentrated experience of experts for intellectual support of decision-making on the estimation of efficiency of financial maintenance of innovation activity. The received results show that the evaluation of priority strategic directions for machine-building enterprises in terms of efficiency of financial support of innovation activity will determine a hierarchical structured set of innovation strategies for each enterprise, taking into consideration the available financial support and external and internal environment of the enterprise.

abstract={The present paper provides the concept of self-renewing of ecosystems. It is shown that multidimensionality and mutual exclusion of individual components of the environment make the problem of optimization, i.e. achieving the conditions of sustainable development, too difficult. However, the goal of sustainable nature management is possible with the existence of ecosystem properties for self-renewal due to the presence of cyclical processes, ecological capacity, migration capabilities of ecosystem components and pollutants metabolism, as well as the use of waste-free and energy-saving technologies. It is proposed to model the ecosystem in the form of the "eight", which reflects it as a closed cyclic system able for adaptation. When analyzing such a complex system, the following principles should be followed: simplification; consideration of processes in dynamics; considering the possibility of ambiguity, incompleteness and inaccuracy of information; using a risk-based approach to impact assessment; understanding the system as a hierarchical structure able for adaptation and development. It is noted that all local ecosystems in the region are interconnected and affect the characteristics of neighboring local ecosystems, usually requiring the adjustment of resources and connections. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The article examines the determinants of the concept of forest recreation management. Based on a critical analysis of scientific works on the study of the component composition of recreational forest use, three components have been identified, namely: recreational resources, recreational facilities, recreational activities. Four key components of recreational forest use have been identified: resource, social, economic, innovation and investment. The main indicators of the development of forest recreation management taking into account the component distribution have been investigated. A model for determining the overall efficiency of recreational forest use by taking into account the efficiency of each selected component is proposed. Usage of Excel is suggested to predict the level of recreational forest use. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

Key trends in the development of the global mineral resources market in economic, ecological, energy and digital dimensions have been identified. The features of the world distribution of raw material base of ore and energy mineral resources in terms of their economic assessment have been studied and the countries - market drivers - have been identified. A model for sustainable development of the mineral resources market and a system of criteria for its assessment in the context of Industry 4.0 have been proposed. In particular, the link between the level of digital technologies and the energy trilemma has been analysed. Based on the results of the calculations, the grouping of the leading countries in the mineral resources market by the level of achievement of sustainable development has been carried out and ways to digitize the mining industry have been outlined. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The article presents the essence of the environmental safety management system of territorial objects as a set of actions and processes aimed at planning and constructing optimal options for spatio-temporal structural and functional organization of ecosystems, restoration and enhancement of their ecological potential and sustainability, prevention and development of environmental risks. The structural blocks of the system are: environmental audit, environmental design (planning), environmental monitoring, databases and data banks using GIS technologies. An important role in the management system of environmental safety of territorial objects belongs to the implementation of the concept of ecosystem services. It is based on the need for coevolutionary development of environmental and economic components. The space of possibilities for admissible variants of the future in the form of a scenario funnel within which alternative lines of development are investigated in scenarios The regional aspect of practical significance of ecosystem services is presented by adjustment of gross accumulations of fixed capital is investigated. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The research paper provides an insight into various aspects of producing electric vehicles in leading foreign countries. Dynamics of increasing specific weight of electric vehicles in the total volume of transport and its predictive indices are under study considering the countries planning their full transition to electric mobility. Topicality of building a wide network of charging stations of various capacity is highlighted. It is indicated that the German Volkswagen, the world largest automobile concern, is going to introduce more new makes of electric vehicles than it was planned before – 70 instead of 50 by 2028. In the coming decade, there will be a trend of raising the number of Volkswagen electric vehicles from 15m to 22m. With that, the share of electric vehicles in the total production is planned to exceed 40%. It is indicated that VW is going to invest 44B euros in designing new equipment. It is mentioned that in many foreign countries, subsidies and tax allowances for electric car owners are essential stimuli from the state. Besides, special attention is paid to improving and developing production of batteries for electric vehicles, in particular in the EU countries. The article suggests outlines of designing electric-mobile innovations and power supply providing sustainable and economically substantiated production of primary power by using wind-generators. Possible production of Ukrainian and Uzbek electric vehicles is under analysis. It is highlighted that production of electric vehicles allows combining two very profitable economic factors – innovative character and mass production. Here, novelty, great demand and scale economy will produce a desirable effect. The authors consider influence of COVID-19 on the global economy and various types of vehicles. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article looks at the inter-linkages and causalities between innovation and knowledge management in terms of sustainable development goals through the case study method. Taking the case of the Toyota Prius, these concepts are further developed in detail. Recognising the fact that no organisational process can happen in a vacuum and that there are a host of extraneous factors that have a significant impact on the process, factors such as culture, vision, incentives are also examined here. Further, this article delves into some of the characteristics that successful organisations display and seeks to extrapolate from the specific to general implications for organisations that aim to be successfully innovative. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Standard biomonitoring system based on sampling technology is not capable of efficient environmental control and ecosystem protection from anthropogenic impacts and followed degradation because of its extremely delayed response to any environmental changes and pollution first of all. Contemporary approach to ecological biomonitoring turns to on-line control of environmental safety. New online technologies and systems of ecological control based on monitoring of the activity parameters in some species-biosensors have been intensively introduced in many countries since 90s as biological early warning systems (BEWS) such as Musselmonitor. The next step is the development of up-to-date technology from simple BEWS to online biosensor monitoring (OBM) in natural ecosystems as a promising tool for immediate detecting of environmental changes and aquatic toxicity in particular. The first technology of online ecological monitoring has been developed in MMBI (1985-2016) from basic to applied research. It was established, that to obtain the reliable OBM technology the background behavior must be properly investigated for long time prior to online-biomonitoring implementation in the field. Nowadays the main task for online biosensor monitoring is the bioindication technology for recognizing of any harm pollution effects online in any time span. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Nowadays the development of Russian Arctic territories became a paramount problem of socio-economic development of our country and technical growth. Such a breakthrough can come true because of an effective state politics (rising of life grade, high standard investment protection by the law, strict requirement of protecting nature) and attracting of investment to comprehensive development of Arctic regions, including risk projects in long. However, the provisions of the state policy about the Arctic region is not completed today. The comprehensive way of region development is not shown. The specific Arctic conditions and especially a commerce control not completed too. The possibility of comprehensive socio-economics growth of the region is addicted to its potential, ability of adaptation for innovations and well risk management. All these factors define a relevance of risk research. In this article presented a risk analysis, defined and systemized the risk factors, on the base of spatial structuring in the coordinate plane, including trends of development and area features with region own potential and quality of socio-economic region development control. The case of risk and accounting have to become a part of the making an administration decisions to decrease the risk influents with using an integrated risk management. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The paper deals with life cycle management of a 3-D printer technology to design an underwater drone hull to study the Arctic. The Arctic region is of strategic importance for the Russian Federation and the entire world community. Due to harsh climatic conditions the scientists started to search for more efficient ways of not only using resources of the territory but also retaining sustainable development of the region. The paper presents a graph that includes activities involved in a 3-D printer life cycle design. A 3-D printer is used for a layer growth of an underwater drone’s hull. The authors took into consideration all the existing options of development, operation and disposal of a particular 3D printer and identified eight variants of its life cycle design based on various financial resources and timing budgets. The study helped to identify a number of effective options. Information and mathematical systems support the implementation of the life cycle management of technology. We selected the following mathematical tools: mathematical programming methods, mathematical statistics, process simulation tools, routine problems, queuing theories. The paper focuses on such information management tools as systems programs, development programs and application software. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article analyzes and studies the current status and development direction of Zhengzhou City by using urban management theory, comparative methods and on-t he-spot investigation methods. Close to the conclusion. As a new first-tier city, Zhengz hou's development level and planning and construction are not yet mature, and there ar e still many problems that need to be solved urgently. The results of the study show th at the overall provision of public goods in Zhengzhou is uneven and inadequate. Public goods are an obvious material manifestation of whether cities are developed or not. In frastructure is a major component of public goods. Housing construction is the top prio rity of the people's livelihood. In response to the housing planning and environmental protection issues in Zhengzhou City, this article puts forward several suggestions: to e xpand the investment of funds to build affordable housing; to resolve the garbage class ification and land layout Environmental issues in Zhengzhou. Environmental protectio n has always been a key issue in China. Both cities and residents should raise their awa reness of environmental protection in order for cities to develop healthily and sustaina bly. This article has a certain reference role for the urban planning and construction of Zhengzhou City. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the development of new energy power generation technology, distributed generation technology and small personal power generation have become an important development direction for new energy power generation. However, distributed generation technology may have the information island phenomenon. due to its construction, grid connection, transaction and other links with data scattered in various departments, enterprises. Besides, difference in products, equipment and data type and lower degree of data sharing in links aggravate this phenomenon. In order to get through and integrate the data information of each new energy system, realize the sharing and centralized management of platform data resources, and remove the business barriers between various departments and enterprises, this paper proposes to use the electric power Internet of things identifier resolution system to standardize the data of all links in the new energy system, and each link in the system uses open data to create more value. In addition, this paper also uses a combination of blockchain technology and the Identifier resolution system to optimize new energy power transactions, and proposes a method for sharing private data in a small range of users. Inject new impetus into the development of new energy distributed generation. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={On September 23, 2019, the World Meteorological Organization WMO published the Global Climate Report 2015-2019, which explained the trend of global warming. The phenomenon of rising global ocean temperature in the report is also an issue that needs to be researched. It will make certain marine life be forced to migrate from their habitats, thus affecting the development of economic industries such as fisheries. As consultants to the Scottish North Atlantic Fisheries Management Association, in this work, we have launched a corresponding study on this issue. Corresponding mathematical models have been established, which can well predict the future distribution of fish populations. Questions are essentially predictions of the future distribution of North Atlantic fish stocks and their impact on fishing companies. So our first task is to build an identification and prediction model of future fish habitat space model (IPM-FFHS Model). Because this distribution is caused by changes in ocean temperature, we have established a prediction model for the average sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic region (AMO-BP Model) based on BP neural network to predict future SST. At the same time, other influential factors of the distribution can modify the model. The AMO-BP Model was then combined with the current distribution of the habitat of the fish to draw a predicted spatial image of the future habitat range. At last, we combined the IPM-FFHS Model to obtain the abandonment temperature threshold of the fishery to obtain the duration of fish migration and the survival environment under different effects. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={Chlorophyll, as an important factor for the normal growth and development of plants, is of great significance for the management of agricultural water and fertilizer. In this study, the chlorophyll content of maize leaves was taken as the research object, and the chlorophyll content prediction model was quantitatively studied. ASD FieldSpec Pro spectrometer was used to measure the spectral reflectance of the leaf samples, and the spectral curve characteristics of different contents were analyzed. The results show that: (1) The reflection spectrum undergoes the nine-point smoothing of Savitzky-Golay and combines with the MSC, NOR, and SNV transforms to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the reflection spectrum. The combination band with higher correlation can significantly improve the stability and prediction of the model ability. (2) In the PLSR model, MSC processing is performed on the smoothed spectrum, and the model established after the second-order differential transformation has the best effect, Rc2 = 0.95, RMSEC = 2.32, SEC = 1.35. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={As a basic infrastructure, the power grid nowadays plays a vital role in society. The huge network and lots of equipment bring about the complexity of management and maintenance. To solve this problem, an automatic, intelligent, and highly scalable computer system stays to be introduced. Based on the above, we propose a smart application cloud platform for smart grids. According to different needs, they can be integrated into corresponding field applications, such as power consumption anomaly detection, user clustering, and equipment status monitoring. This PaaS platform benefits from our rich IoT sensing devices and information network, which can provide all kinds of device information for high-level applications to achieve complex functions. In order to verify our proposed structure, we use anomaly detection smart applications for verification. Experiments show that our work greatly reduces the difficulty of developing smart applications and improves the management efficiency of smart grids. © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science.},

Finally, Matlab/Simulink is used for simulation. The experimental results show that when the control strategy with the minimum equivalent fuel consumption is used, the fuel consumption is 1.95L less than the CD-CS-based strategy, and the fuel saving rate is 31.2%.

abstract={The safety of road infrastructure is the basis for safe operation of roads, and expressways, as high-grade expressways between freeways and non- freeways, involve roads, bridges, tunnels, traffic safety facilities and other infrastructure. Therefore, constructing a risk assessment index system for expressways is a prerequisite for the safety management of expressway operations, which helps to transform "passive processing" into "active prevention". In order to establish a comprehensive and systematic expressway risk assessment system, this paper from the perspective of systems engineering, uses the Interpretive Structural Modelling method to construct many risk factors of the expressway into a causal and hierarchical structure model. For solving the shortcomings of the poor accuracy of the subjective analysis method and the lack of interpretability of the objective analysis method, this paper adopts an improved subjective and objective analysis method to give weight to the indicators at various levels. So as to improve the scientificity of the risk assessment system of the expressway. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.},

abstract={Ecological educational functions of geosystems are to be separately highlighted and considered for the scientific substantiation of this work. Information about the ecological educational functions of geosystems is visualized using interactive geoinformation maps of various thematic content. As an example, an interactive map of vegetation “Along Doppelmair's trail” is presented, which is being developed for one of the remote and closed areas of the Barguzinskii nature reserve of the FSU Zapovednoe Podlemorye. We used both traditional geographic approaches and methods (field research, geobotanical and landscape descriptions) and modern geoinformation technologies (creation of database for every plot on a general landscape basis, interpretation of space images, visualization with infograms, etc.) to create the map. The map shows the characteristic types of vegetation, succession stages of pyrogenic dynamics of forest geosystems that have arisen over a century. The infograms provide information on the places of meeting animals, distribution of plants, features of local landscapes and photographic materials collected during field research. The presented map is one of the ways to popularize environmental protection, solve environmental education issues and represent the educational functions of geosystems. A set of interactive maps of different content is the basis for determining the natural educational potential of geosystems and can be used to improve models of environmental management and nature conservation activities. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={This research aims to know-how education, media information, event frequency and type of event affect the community's understanding of disaster mitigation. Primary data has collected from the survey which was conducted in 2011 in Banda Aceh, around six years after the tsunami disaster December 26 2004. This survey did when the sustainability reconstruction program for tsunami post-disaster had been implementing in Aceh in the range of April 16, 2009, to December 31 2012, after its emergency response and reconstruction programs ended on April 16 2009. The research method used is a verification survey with 223 respondents as a sample. The Questionnaire is analyzed using multiple linear regression to test the hypothesis. Qualitative analysis enriches this survey by collecting and evaluating the related documents. Overall, all variables have an influence of 68% on the community's understanding of disaster mitigation. The media information affects the community's understanding of disaster mitigation significantly, while the education, event frequency, and type of event do not affect the community's understanding of disaster mitigation significantly. The originality lies in the integration model of causality theories from the previous ones and uses multiple linear regression to test the model. The limitation is in the number of variables and the object. This fact implies enriching knowledge in the social sciences and as a basis for further new research models of disaster management. It also implies practical people who implement related variables. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Rainfed lowland rice is the second largest rice growing areas in Indonesia. One of the most vulnerable agro-ecosystems to the climate change is the rainfed lowland because of the erratic, unpredictable rainfall and most of them have very limited access on water resources. The aim of this study was to investigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, production, soil fertility and economic efficiency of integrated crop-livestock management system (ICLS) and farmer practice (FP). The study was conducted at the farmer’s field in Jaken, Pati, Central Java, Indonesia during wet season. The result showed that ICLS in rainfed lowland areas could (1) reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from paddy rice by implementing integrated crop (paddy rice) management technique (ICM), (2) avoided CH4 release from manure of livestock using anaerobic digester to the atmosphere and used the CH4 production for energy purpose, (3) improved the soil fertility by giving additional composted farmyard manure to the soil, and (4) enhanced the economic benefit for farmers. ICLS approach is one of the options where adaptation and mitigation technology could be conducted in a synergistic way. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study examines the relationship between SNI ISO Quality Management System (QMS) Standards to Industrial Property Rights in Indonesia using Spearman Correlation Analysis. The focus of research is on the comparison of the correlation coefficient value of quality management system standards: SNI ISO 9001 QMS, SNI ISO 14001 EMS, SNI ISO 22000 FSMS, SNI ISO 13485 MD-QMS, SNI ISO 27001 ISMS, SNI ISO 16949 A-QMS with industrial property rights: patents, simple patents, industrial designs and brands in Indonesia. The test conducted was to see the data relationship between the number of QMS standard certificates to Indonesia's industrial property rights for seven years, starting from 2009 to 2015. The Spearman Correlation method analyzes the correlation coefficient value on the development of certificate data held in Indonesia. The Spearman correlation test results show that several QMS standards have significant values that have entered the tolerance limit or have gone out of the tolerance limit for industrial property rights. This evidence suggests several quality management system standards able to contribute to the development of innovation in a country, especially Indonesia. © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science},

abstract={LED phyto-irradiators are promising for use in irradiation systems for growing plants in greenhouses using photoculture technology. Cases, when the thermal calculation of phyto-irradiators is performed incorrectly, have an overheating in the active area of the crystal. It results in faster degradation of the semiconductor, reduces the output luminous flux and the service life of the device. To evaluate and analyze scientific works studying thermal models of LED operating modes, examples of the application of modern methods for determining thermal resistances, to study local heating zones on phyto-irradiator boards when using different types of LEDs and modern thermal imagers to detect soldering defects. The authors classified and analyzed the collected materials according to application criteria and implementation prospects. In the course of the research the authors applied methods of systematic approach. To assess the effectiveness of dissipation of thermal energy released by a LED crystal, they calculate the following parameters: thermal resistance between p-n transition and housing, thermal resistance between housing and PCB, thermal resistance between PCB and the environment. The thermal resistance between the p-n junction and the housing is due to the design of the LED, other parameters are set by the thermal models of the developed lighting devices. The applied methods of cooling do not essentially influence the complexity of thermal models, liquid cooling allows to refuse radiator for the linear thermal model, that slightly raises the accuracy of measurements and simplifies the process of calculation of thermal resistance of transition-housing. The primary role in thermal management of luminaires with SMD elements lies in the following elements: power supply circuits, SMD LED soldering quality and materials used, LED locations, PCB dimensions and location in space, ambient temperature, adequate calculation of thermal resistance between the LED and the environment and selection of radiators. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Recently, much attention has been paid in the world community to environmental protection, human health, mainly through the reduction of production and consumption waste dumping. Today, the problem of waste is the most relevant. Waste becomes not only a source of environmental pollution, but also deteriorates the sanitary-epidemiological and aesthetic qualities of nature. Besides, some wastes have properties that allow their further use as secondary raw materials, which is quite interesting from the point of view of their use as a material resource, and their return to the circulation of working capital acquires an important environmental, economic and energy-saving value. The purpose of the study is to characterize modern technologies for processing agricultural waste and to offer directions for waste integrated management. It is planned to collect information presenting a particular practical interest to agricultural producers, as well as to state and other regulatory bodies in the field of agriculture. The methodological basis of the study included the provisions of various theories and methodologies for the analysis of agricultural sustainability, methods to forecast the economic development of rural territories. The information base of the study was statistical collections and directories of state and regional statistics bodies, federal and regional regulatory legal acts, expert databases. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Digital transformation of agriculture is a part of the federal strategy, the purpose of which is to modernize and increase the efficiency of the industry, to introduce digital technologies and platform solutions to ensure a technological breakthrough in the agricultural sector. Dairy cattle breeding is the largest livestock sub-sector of the Russian Federation. Demand for automated milking, feed preparation and herd management systems is growing in this country. The purpose of the study is to determine the prospects for the upgrading of dairy cattle breeding within the framework of existing strategic documents and the availability of domestic developments. It has been established that currently there are some domestic developments, including those in the field of dairy cattle robotics that are more affordable, which could replace expensive foreign counterparts. Therefore, the dissemination of information about domestic developments in this area is a very urgent task to improve production efficiency in the industry. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The method of basic tillage in the form of dump plowing continues to be dominant in the cultivation of agricultural crops, so plows are being improved in many directions. In some models of ploughs, a full rotation of soil layers, an alternative direction of their rotation, smooth adjustment of the width of the grip, various ways of alternating left-and right-hand working bodies, and many more variations are used. The aim of the study is to summarize the latest achievements in these areas in order to design a rational plow. A rational design should combine the best performance indicators for the quality of work and energy costs as well as ease of maintenance and management of the arable unit. The proposed scheme of a hinged rotary plow can be considered rational, since it performs plowing with high quality at the level of agricultural technology. It provides a smooth state of the plowed surface, a full turn of the layers, deep burying of all plant residues and weed seeds in the soil, and aligns the ridges on the surface layer of the soil. Power consumption during plowing is reduced due to the absence of coulters, field boards, reduced plow weight and accurate orientation of the thrust force vector. The management of the ploughing unit is facilitated by automating the rotation of the working bodies, the absence of idle crossings across the field, reducing the length of the plough, the absence of side loads, as well as by more convenient adjustments. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The paper aims to research a possibility of storing plant agricultural raw materials. Rational management of natural resources is a dominant trend in the economy development, which involves the fullest processing of plant raw materials intended for human consumption with minimum waste. Active grain ventilation is conducted by drying at a low temperature to preserve the quality of raw and wet grain, as well as by cooling grain batches stored to increase their durability. With a certain moisture content grain can be gradually dried, cooled, preserved, aerated depending on its condition and purpose. These technological methods provide a significant reduction in energy costs in comparison with thermal drying, as well as improving the quality of seeds and grains due to the "soft" completion of the biochemical processes associated with maturation and stabilization of the protein-enzyme complex. Active ventilation requires no complex equipment or large capital investments. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the technologies developed on the basis of active ventilation are widely used in processing of main volumes of high quality grain in USA, Canada, and Australia. The intensification of the grain preparation process achieved by this way reduces energy costs of drying. The study models the storage conditions for bulks of various types of agricultural raw materials under active ventilation. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Modern climatic resources of model regions (Orenburg oblast and Altai Krai) were identified and their agricultural assessment was made to explain scientifically development and implementation of approaches of rational environmental management to agricultural use of farming lands in the post-virgin land regions of Ural and West Siberia. Open access special data on climatic research have served as a source of meteorological information. Commonly accepted methods of the statistical analysis were used to process digital content. It was ascertained that under a total aridity within the studied regions their modern climatic resources had a line of special features. Altai Krai is characterized by more favorable conditions for spring crops vegetation due to predominant precipitation during the summer months and less favorable conditions for winter crops, especially against the background of cooling during the winter months. In Orenburg oblast, increasing aridity of the summer months may prevent complete actualization of productive potential of spring crops and formation of full-grown shoots of winter crops. Introduction of nature-similar technologies in landscape-adaptive systems of agriculture was considered as the principal way to use effectively climatic resources. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={In accordance with the research purpose, the effectiveness of adaptive pork quality management technology using chitosan was evaluated. The natural biopolymer was used during raising and fattening of sows. The introduction of chitosan in the technological cycle of pork production made it possible to increase the live weight by 7.42-16.74, to shorten the period of reaching a live weight of 100 kg by 3.11-3.89%. Meat productivity due to an increase in the slaughter mass and carcass yield increased by 1.65-13.46%, meat quality due to an increase in the carcass length, mass of the back third of the carcass, and the “muscle” eye increased by 1.84-10.85%. The effect of chitosan on the ratio of meat to fat was identified - it increased by 13.41%, and the coefficient reflecting the ratio of moisture to dry matter and moisture to protein decreased by 7.37-9.79%. The greatest effect was achieved when using chitosan for both sows and piglets, while the minimum effect was achieved when using chitosan only for sows. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The automation of agriculture increases labour productivity and contributes to an increase in the output of agricultural products, an increase in their quality. These processes are closely related to the application of industrial production technology in agriculture, the improvement of planning and management. Also, the improvement of product quality and the growth of labour productivity are associated with the development of automated control systems that contribute to the autonomous operation of entire agricultural complexes. This paper deals with the development of a mathematical model of a milking installation based on stepper motors. The authors of the work recreated the operation of the milking installation, taking into account the operation of the kinematic scheme of the robot and the dynamics of the stepping motors, positioning of its working body near the tops of the teats of the udder of the animal, which are automatically recognized using image analysis from the 3D TOF camera. The uniqueness of this model lies in the fact that various stages of the operation of an autonomous milking installation are concentrated in one software product. This technology makes it possible to study the effect of each stage separately on the static positioning error of the manipulator working body. The model has been tested, an acceptable accuracy of the results of the model operation is achieved. This model can be recommended for use for engineering calculations and the development of control algorithms for the movement of the working body of the manipulator. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Elements and systems of automated management of the dairy herd, questions of prompt and reliable evaluation of their economic efficiency using the proposed information system are considered. The market offers various options for automated herd management, accompanied by expert assessments of technological and production effects. However, to make decisions on the economic viability of new solutions, clear algorithms and information systems are needed to convert this data into economic effects and economic efficiency assessments. Official statistics for the Russian Federation and the Southern Federal District formed the base of this study. Design calculations were performed for one of the agricultural organizations of the Krasnodar Territory. The research results were obtained using discounting methods, mathematical modeling, programming in SQL, as well as the original method of transforming non-standard cash flow by highlighting its multidirectional members. The calculations performed using the information system made it possible to evaluate the considered innovations as cost-effective, with short payback periods and high profitability. This allowed us to conclude that the automated management of the dairy herd is promising not only from the technological, but also from the economic point of view. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={This study covers the problem of managing the development of the dairy industry. One of the tasks is the need to develop a non-standard approach to the theoretical foundations of regulation of this industry and recommendations for its practical application. The study is based on the methodology of systemic, integrated and territorial approaches using methods of economic interpretation of research results, operational and comparative analyzes. Scientific novelty lies in the theoretical substantiation of a multi-level paradoxical model of the relationship between the parameters of the dairy industry. The paradox is the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the regulatory impact and the parameters of the dairy industry, having a functional relationship with it (the correlation coefficient is close to 0), through a multi-level chain of indirect relationships of parameters that have a closer relationship with the regulator and indicators that are dependent on it indirectly. To implement the proposed hypothesis, a new mechanism of action is needed, which allows, on the basis of actual data taken from open sources, developing separate digital models of the dairy industry for the subjects of the Russian Federation. The maximum margin of error of such models shall not exceed 10 %. Based on the results of developing a digital model and testing its information and computer technology, it was concluded that it should be used in forecasting processes for the development of the dairy industry, depending on the regulatory impacts expressed by the invested amount of state support funds. Testing of the proposed theory is carried out according to the results of 3 scenarios of forecasting the development of the dairy industry in the Novosibirsk oblast for a 2-year period, calculated based on the proposed digital technology. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It is aimed at creating a multipurpose farmland with expectation of increase in both benefits and productivity. Subsurface drainage pipes which are installed inside mole-drain, functions as water channel that flows water into the drainage channel. Simulation was run using a 2D numerical soil water flow model based on Richard's equation. It integrates varying soil textures with aim of figuring the optimum setting of sub-drains in response to soil textures. The depth of sub-drain was established at 40cm beneath the surface for all conditions as it is the current installation available in Indonesia. Our simulation shows the variation of soil moisture and pressure over distance, time and different textures under specified spacing of sub-surface installation. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={From an economic perspective, rice is an important crop. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is known as a rice production technology with a high economic value. The economic value varies depending on different implementations of water level in the SRI paddy field. This study was conducted to determine the best water level for SRI paddy cultivation based on its economic value regarding paddy field ecosystem service. In this study, SRI paddy rice was cultivated in experimental pots, and the water levels were regulated at -12, -7, -5, -3, 0 and +2 cm from the soil surface by using Mariotte tubes. The economic value can be calculated using the Total Economic Value (TEV) framework, namely, by considering the amount of irrigation water used, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the yields. The value is then optimized by Excel solver to maximize the balance in economic value as the objective. The water level was set as a changing value with the constraint not less than -12 and not more than +2. This analysis found that the best water level for SRI paddy cultivation is -5.88 cm from the soil surface based on its economic value (49.708 million IDR per hectare). © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an important indicator of phytoplankton bloom and water eutrophication. It is also a basic parameter of water quality. Remote sensing technology has been widely used for water quality monitoring in the past. In this study, the Chinese GF1 (Gaofen-1) WFV (Wide Field of View) images acquired on May 19th, 2016 were used to retrieve Chl-a concentration of central Bohai sea in order to assess the recovery condition of marine ecosystem which has been seriously polluted by the Penglai 19-3 platform oil spill accident in 2011. The remote sensing model of Chl-a concentration was developed using the linear regression method. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method showed that the average relative error and root mean square error (RMSE) between retrieved Chl-a concentration and in situ measurement was 11.67% and 0.1808, respectively. It indicated that the remote sensing model could correctly reflect the Chl-a concentration and its spatial distribution of the study area. The average Chl-a concentration in the buffer regions with the distance of 2km, 4km, 6km to the Penglai 19-3 platform was 0.32μg/L, 0.37μg/L and 0.40μg/L, respectively. They were in normal range and lower than that of the coastal waters. The spatial distribution of the result was similar to previous studies of Bohai sea in spring. These results indicated that Chl-a concentration of central Bohai sea was returned to normal after oil spill accident occurred for 5 years. The growth of phytoplankton in surface seawater has been returned to normal. The major causes for Chl-a concentration in the Bohai Sea was the land-sourced pollutant during the study period. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The sudden pollution accident in a river basin is combined with accident cause, cause factor (pollutants) and the receptive environment all together, this study brings up the method to establish the information chain of sudden pollution accidents in a river basin which can describe the causality of all information. Take the sudden oil pollution accident in a river basin as an example, the information system of sudden pollution accidents in a river basin is established from five aspects: pollution source characteristics, pollution characteristics, regional environment characteristics, lash-up treatment technology status and pollution impact characteristics. Through index abstraction and structure representation for the above information, and connect the interactive relationship of the node variables with directed edge line segments, based on which the expert knowledge analysis synthesis method is applied to achieve the optimal causal direction relationship, and the information chain of sudden oil pollution accident in the river basin is ultimately established. This information chain can sufficiently show the causal relationship of each information elements in the sudden pollution accident and can supply decision making basis for examining and distinguishing the status of a sudden water pollution accident in a river basin and determining the precise lash-up treatment technology. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={In this paper, through numerical simulation, the modulation effect of trees on the wind field of the highway and the wind load of the traffic is studied. Two tree species were selected, and the effects of different tree species and arrangement numbers on the wind speed on the embankment and the wind pressure on the driving surface were studied, by simulating the single-row distribution of a single tree species and the mixed multi-row distribution of two tree species. The results show that trees play a significant role in wind field modulation, and different tree species have different effects; Compared with the modulation of single tree species, the mixed modulation effect is more effective, and gradually increases with the number of rows, but the trend of enhancement gradually slows down. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={For landscape architects, how to provide a highly quality forest landscape for visitors has always been an important topic. This study based on the results of previous field observation, combined with eye tracking technology and psychological perception questionnaire, and used the Wilcoxon rank sum test, T test and Spearman's rho correlation analysis in SPSS 23.0 to statistically analyze the data. The main purpose is to clarify the relationship between visual behavior characteristics and psychological perception evaluation of the forest waterscape space where tourists have more behavioral evaluations during forest walk. Main results are as follows: 1. There are differences eye movement behaviors of different types of forest waterscape space, especially in the visual span; 2. There are significant differences visitor's psychological evaluation of different types of forest waterscape in five indices, which in whether the landscape content is changing, whether the color is rich, whether the color is bright, whether the space is open and whether you can see the distant landscape; 3. There is a correlation between human eye movement behavior and psychological perception evaluation in different types of forest waterscape spaces. The scenes with a large number of fixations also have higher satisfaction, and fixations count have positively correlated with the spatial perception evaluation results, which including plant diversity, landscape richness, permeability and the layering. That is to say, richness of landscape elements and color, permeability of the space and the regularity of the forest waterscape space affect the participants' eye movement observation mode. Through the above analysis, we suggest that in the planning and design of forest waterscape space should be considerate the characteristics of different landscape elements, meanwhile we should pay attention to the interspersion of appropriate heterogeneous landscape space. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The paper presents indicators of modern business management, based on the current economic situation of its management. When selecting indicators, the emphasis is placed on the last stage of management evolution, which is characterized by the primary role of scientific and technical achievements in the development of the economy, including its commercial sector, and, accordingly, such resulting and factor indicators as changes in income and expenses, direct and indirect ratio of income and profit to expenditures on human capital, investment capital, and innovation capital are taken into account. The construction of these dependencies between changes in income and expenses is carried out through a combination of different types of dependencies (additive, multiplicative, multiple), which help to identify the degree of influence of each factor indicator on the resulting indicators and take actions to maximize the result and minimize business costs using the computational and constructive method in interaction with individual elements of mathematical analysis. The material is useful for entrepreneurs, regardless of their type of activity and organizational and legal status, educational and scientific figures, students of higher and secondary specialized institutions of economic and managerial programs, specialties and profiles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The author systematizes scientific developments on application of artificial intelligence, robotics, computer technologies and other information tools in the activities of public authorities. The concept of "intellectual management"has been reviewed and its importance for implementation in the activities of public authorities has been determined. The history of global intellectual governance development is described. The world positive and negative experience of introducing cyberdemocracy, electronic government, electronic requests and other technologies in public administration was analyzed. Prospects for governance intellectualization in public authorities of the Russian Federation have been defined. It has been found that attempts to intellectualize governance are being actively introduced on a global scale, but this process is time-consuming and has many obstacles which the study is focused on. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Currently, Russia is one of the top five countries in terms of onion cultivation areas. It should be noted that Russia is also the largest importer of onions. Onion production in agricultural organizations and farms is increasing. High consumer demand and relatively low resource costs allow classifying this area of management as the most profitable and easy types of agribusiness. The paper shows the need to increase the economic efficiency of onion production in the central part of the Russian Federation. The necessary volume for import substitution is calculated. It is economically justified to use the technology of sowing onion seeds 90+50 cm in comparison with the traditional technology. The highest yield was obtained when seeding with an experimental machine at a seeding rate of 20 million units/ha. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of the study is to investigate and analyse the different aspects of the innovation development of the North-Western Federal District (the Russian Federation). The concepts of innovations, innovation development, innovative economy, knowledge-based economy, state innovation system, innovation ecosystem and regional innovation development have been defined. Also, author's definition of the innovative development of a region was proposed. Documents regulating the innovation strategy and innovation policy of the North-Western Federal District have been analysed. The justification of the undertaken topic comes from the need for defining strong areas of the innovation potential of the North-Western Federal District and requirement for consideration of the regional innovation system elements of the North-Western Federal District such as knowledge-producing environment, knowledge transfer mechanisms, business environment and state, and its innovation infrastructure. The methodology of the study involves studying of the theoretical framework of the innovations, quantitative and qualitative indicators of the innovation development of the North-Western Federal District, and analysis and synthesis of these data. The main results of the study are: Innovative development of the region correlates with the general direction of the country's innovative development; the regional innovation system includes the same macroblocks as the national innovation system does; the North-Western region includes the well-developed innovation infrastructure and all elements of the innovation system. Conclusions on the direction of the innovation development of the North-Western Federal District towards the world's advanced countries with innovative economy or economy of knowledge as well as on the role of the innovation factor in the regional development have been drawn. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},
