abstract={In the early stages of a software development project, estimating the amount of effort is one of the most important project management concerns. This study has successfully produced global optimal reduced models intelligently predicting software cost estimation by employing neural networks with back-propagation learning algorithms combined with genetic algorithms (GA-NN) to determine the most significant explanatory variables among the 16 COCOMO cost drivers. The performance of the full model of GA-NN is much superior to that of the COCOMO, whilst the predicting performance of its global optimal reduced model is also comparable to that of the COCOMO in terms of MMRE and PRED (25). The optimal reduced models and their found significant factors can offer powerful supports for the project managers to make right decisions in the early stages of the projects. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The network cascade topology structure of large logistics supply chain and its invulnerability were researched. Logistics supply chain is the combination set of entities such as warehouse, highway, railway, aviation, etc. And its stability of network structure determined the survival and development of the user in the network and supply chain. In order to improve the stability and robustness of logistics supply chain network, an improved cascaded topology structure of large logistics supply chain network with Internet of things in complex environment was proposed based on metric uniform random distribution, and cascading invulnerability of mathematical analysis model was proposed. The probability distribution and critical value of logistics and supply chain network cascading failure was solved in complex environment, and the logistics supply chain network paralysis and damage problems were analyzed from the view of probability and critical value analysis. Take the intelligent car supply chain as the example, simulation result shows that the invulnerability analysis effect is perfect, and the cascading invulnerability critical value is solved precisely, research results provide important theoretical support to realize the intelligent logistic management, it has good application value in the research of logistics supply chain network security and stability. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To facilitate instrument management at university, we propose an instrument management system in this paper. This new type of equipment management is expected to replace traditional management methods. Although at university the degree of computer information is rather high, the current instrument management methods are very outdated. Even in some universities, related personnel still adopt very primitive method to manage the teaching equipment. However, with experiment science developing and more and more focus on instrument utilization in the teaching process, the amount of teaching instrument grows exponentially, which imposes a new challenge to the traditional methods of teaching instrument. To cope with this problem, we first conduct some research on this problem. Then, based on this research, an online teaching instrument system is implemented, which nearly covers all the needs of the system requirement. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Cloud storage can provide a flexible on-demand data storage service to users anywhere and anytime. However, users' data is owned by cloud service provider physically, and the physical boundary between two users' data is fuzzy. Moreover, cloud storage provider stores multiple replicas of data in order to increase robustness of users' data. The user is charged by the amount of replicas. However, the evidence cloud storage provider actually spends more storage space is scarce. In this environment, a method to ensure multi-replica integrity must be provided. In order to avoid retrieving enormous storage data and users themselves checking, a multi-replica public auditing protocol was proposed based on the BLS short signature scheme and the homomorphic hash function. Based on the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption, the presented protocol is secure against the lost attack and tamper attack from cloud service provider. As the independence among blocks and block signatures, this protocol supports block-level dynamic update, including insertion, modification and deletion. So, the protocol is secure and efficient, and supports for multi-replica, public verification, dynamic update and privacy preserving. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper proposes a joint spatio-frequency resource model and management strategy in cognitive MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) systems by exploiting the spatial signal processing ability provided by multi-antenna techniques. With the scheme cognitive system could coexist with the primary in one occupied authorized frequency channel without interfere with the later. Accordingly cognitive transmission could be carried out even there is no idle spectrum available. This is a complement to traditional CR in which the performance of cognitive user depends to a great extent on the availability of spectrum hole. Simulation results show that compared with conventional CR, the proposed method could effectively improve the performance of cognitive user on the premises that no interference is imposed on the primary. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

This article proposes a new special vehicle monitoring system in order to meet the needs of intelligent transportation industry. The monitoring system for special transport vehicles is designed to pass a full range of real-time monitoring to safeguard the vehicle transport of dangerous or valuable goods in transit security. The system has two main subsystems, including vehicle terminal subsystem and server-side subsystem. Wherein, the main function of the vehicle terminal subsystem is to all-round monitoring the specialty vehicles, including video, vehicle status, goods status and environment status etc. The terminal ensures the effectiveness of monitoring by using a 3G-based hybrid network access. The server-side subsystem is primarily responsible for information collection/processing/storage, providing monitoring display and publishing the WEB services which supported logistics information management systems and real-time traffic information. In practice, this article designs and implements a prototype system based on a natural gas transport fleet. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Petroleum engineering is a complicated subject which involves multidisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, operators and managers to use real-time and historic data to perform modeling, interpretation, analysis and decision-making activities. During this process, some very crucial tasks come from how to effectively collect and manage the acquired datasets, how to efficiently provide data services, and how to control and assess data quality. In addition, heterogeneous sources and various types of the datasets make the process more complicated. To achieve effective data engineering, metadata is discussed in this paper. Furthermore, a comprehensive, extensible and operational metadata model is presented. The model is discussed from different perspectives. Conceptually, it is a metadata framework with four levels of abstraction. Logically, it characterizes a three-dimensional geological data map that interconnects geological entities on the plane and mounts data resources as sub-trees on the other dimension. Physically, it adopts a federated topology and supports distributed storage and management by virtual nodes mapping. Finally, how the metadata model works in data governance, collection, management, and service is illustrated. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The workflow management system plays an important role in enterprise information management system. An enterprise workflow contains a lot of business process and their relevancies. These relevancies are important in building workflow management system. This paper proposes a business relevance based workflow localization method to divide the workflow locally. In this method, a workflow is treated as a combination of local processes; therefore single task can be divided into several subtasks. This method can reduce the difficulty and improve the efficiency in building workflow management system. This method has been practically applied to the design and development of steel pipe production supervision control system. The actual results validate the effectiveness of the proposed workflow localization method. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Disconnection is the real one which influences the transmission of data and media in the wireless environment. Due to the influence on the transmission quality, the disconnections are divided into temporary disconnections and longtime disconnections. To solve the disconnections, Wireless TCP Disconnection Management was propounded, which concludes TCP Fast Reconnection Mechanism for the Temporary Disconnection and User-Defined Times of TFRMTD. First, TFRMTD mechanism in the wireless was discussed in detail, which implements the fast reconnection through giving every client a unique ID and catching the results at the server. Second, UDTT is introduced, which discusses how to judge the failing of TFRMTD on the disconnections and then conclude it's a longtime disconnection. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The collection and management of dynamic traffic information is one of the most important part of ITS. It's a main task for it to improve the accuracy of the acquisition of the traffic information when facing up with different kinds of traffic detectors. Data fusion method can deal with data from different detectors and improve the accuracy. This paper first analyzed the characters of different traffic detectors, and proposed a method to repair the missing values which is a common phenomenon in the detect data. Then some improvements are made to adjust the BP neural network so that it could be suitable for data fusion. At last, the data fusion of traffic speed from the south of Jianguomen Qiao to the north of Chaoyangmen Qiao on the second ring road of Beijing is given as an example with the comparison of different improve methods of BP neural networks, and it shows that the method given in this passage is efficient in improving the accuracy of the traffic data detection. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Several trends are opening up the era of cloud computing. It moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in cloud computing. We use RSA's homomorphic property to construct the protocol of provable data possession. In our protocol, we can aggregate multiple Provable Data possession into one, and reduce the overhead of communication. While prior work on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the specific implementations, this paper achieves an effective proof of storage protocol. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Many existing automatic summarization methods often process a text based on the paragraphs. These methods ignore the correlation degree among paragraphs, which lead to the inaccuracy of the extracted summary. To solve the problem, we present a method based on mutual information. Firstly, we divide the whole text into several smaller blocks which relevant to each topic by measuring the degree of association among words, sentences and paragraphs. Then we compute the weight of the sentences by using the improved formula which aims to evaluate the importance of one sentence to a topic. Finally, the summary can be generated by combining the sentences selected from the different topics. The experiment result shows the validity of the method. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To infer the network protocol state machine is very useful in network security-related contexts, both in research and management. This process follows an extension of the classic Angluin's L* algorithm and has achieved an extended version of some Mealy automata to represent or model a communication protocol. The algorithm has been validated by inferring the protocol state machine from SMTP, FTP protocol, and tested offline algorithms for the comparison experiments. The experimental results show that this method can more accurately identify the network protocol state machine and is of the important application value. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of hydropower in China, there are a lot of reservoirs under constructions are put into operation. Therefore, resource scheduling of distributed water conservancy project has become a key focus in current researches. Based on distributed water multi-level resources, the paper put forward to apply the improved genetic algorithm to reservoir resource scheduling. In this way, water level sequence can be the basic genetic algorithm coding scheme, and storage status of reservoir can be stored with the array. Then the genetic algorithm coding can be operated based on the corresponding array index of each reservoir. The paper tries to prove the feasibility of this scheduling policy with some examples, simplifying the process of scheduling algorithm and providing guiding basis for water resource scheduling. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are widely applied in various applications. But due to the resource-constrained sensor nodes and the malicious attacks, the traditional key management schemes are not suitable for the network. Contraposing the particularities, many relevant key management schemes are developed for WSNs the network. Based on the framework of WSNs, existing schemes can be classified into two categories: flat distributed architecture and hierarchical architecture. In this paper, a hybrid key management scheme for wireless sensor network is proposed by combining the distributed architecture and the hierarchical architecture. Based on the modified version of Du's matrix construction, this scheme can apply in WSNs with the network topology changes. Compared with existing key management schemes, this scheme can provide sufficient security, nicer key connectivity and low key storage overhead. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Web 2.0 technologies have offered interactive map services on the Internet. Google Maps is a map service that makes available its API (application programming interface) for developing Web-based geospatial applications. In such applications, layers are used to organise spatial data. Using layers, users can abstract from data that are irrelevant to their interest. However, Google Maps API has no direct support to the development of custom layers management. Developers have to design and implement such support in every application they develop. It makes the development processes less efficient and error prone. This paper proposes a software framework to facilitate the development of geospatial applications with custom layers based on Google Maps. Using this framework, developers can produce higher quality applications in shorter time. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={During our daily management of server cluster, different administrators use the same account (usually root) and password to log on from different remote clients. So logs on servers couldn't trace specific operator once encountering security incident, for only administrator "root" was recorded. Therefore, it's of great practical significance to discuss some new server access methods with multiple administration accounts. Considering the UNIX server cluster management of large enterprises, this paper provides a feasible solution of account management system based on Openldap and SUDO. This system establishes a strict behavior-monitoring framework of each server's operation commands and maintenance process. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={These days, Web services, which are based on XML and consist of several XML-related technologies, have been emerging as a promising technology, and it seems that Web services may be used in the field of network management. In this paper, we examine Web services as a XML-based approach to network management. Since Web services are a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) more than just a set of technologies, it could be used in XML-based network management, not only at the technology level, but also at the architecture level, which has many remarkable advantages and may be more effective in network management along with the concepts of Peer-to-Peer and Point-to-Point, in order to make a better use of its capability. Correspondingly, two models are presented to further demonstrate the potential of Web services in XML-based network management. Some implementation issues for the model at the architecture level are also demonstrated in this paper. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of Internet technology and Cloud Computing, more and more applications have to be confronted with the challenges of big data. NoSQL Database is fit to the management of big data because of the characteristics of high scalability, high availability and high fault-tolerance. And it is one of the technologies of the management of big data. We will improve the performance of massive data processing of NoSQL Database through the large scale data parallel data processing and data localize of computing. So how to allocate the data will be a big challenge of NoSQL Database. In this paper we will propose a data allocation strategy based on the node's load, which can adjust the data allocation strategy by the execute status of the system. And it can keep the balance of data allocation by a small cost. At last we will use some experiments to verify the effectiveness of the strategy which is proposed in this paper. The experiments show that it can improve the system's performance than other allocation strategy. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Due to the great progress of computer technology and mature development of network, more and more data are generated and distributed through the network, which is called data streams. During the last couple of years, a number of researchers have paid their attention to data stream management, which is different from the conventional database management. At present, the new type of data management system, called data stream management system (DSMS), has become one of the most popular research areas in data engineering field. Lots of research projects have made great progress in this area. Since the current DSMS does not support queries on sequence data, this paper, we will focus on multi-attribute streams, such as video films. We will discuss the related issues such as how to build an efficient index for all queries of different streams and the corresponding query processing mechanisms. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To meet the needs of universities realizing their own development model, it is important to discuss the issues of application of management information system based on informationized education. Application of management information system based on informationized education has been gradually implemented in universities. Under the action of "productive forces determine the relations of production". The reform of the teaching mode of universities has been deeply affected. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a standardized teaching system, improve the level of teaching, promote the interaction between teaching and learning, and help students to learn, obtain student feedback, and complete the functional orientation of teaching evaluation. The key of structuring higher education management information system is not the traditional physical state, but need to meet the dialectical relationship between 'productivity' and 'relations of production'. In recent years, with the establishment and application of the management information system of universities, not only did the universities achieve the paperless office, but also greatly improved the efficiency of the internal operation. Many authors discussed on OA office system, and financial system. However, the author thinks it still need to seriously explore the problem of application of management information system based on informationized education. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

By assessing applicable literature as well as feedback and lessons learned from relevant support projects, a strategy for the management of component obsolescence is proposed. The aim of the research is to explore the problem of managing DMS strategies by the method of project management and describes the risk of running distinct strategies to solve problems of DMS by fuzzy theory and possibility theory. Based on the results, this paper can be applied to support businesses quickly to determine the Strategies Combination, Resource Allocation and Inventory by using the model and genetic algorithm. A case study of an aerospace industry is used to illustrate the concept developed, which would be meaningful to reduce applicable obsolescence risks and thereby reducing related inventory and manpower costs. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

So the Stratified hierarchical structure model can be built. As a result the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model can be established. More over this paper applies MATLAB to solve the calculation of the model. Through the empirical analysis the evaluation result is consistent with the actual situation. Finally the result shows that the model have an important guiding significance to safety management work in colleges and universities, besides it is feasibility and operability. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The paper deals with cross-cutting issues in architecture, landscape architecture and urban design and addresses the question of how we can best cohesively integrate all aspects of energy systems, transport systems, waste and water management, passive and active strategies, natural ventilation and so on, into contemporary urban design of 'Eco-Cities' with an improved environmental performance of cities. This text reflects upon practical strategies focused on increasing sustainability beyond and within the scope of individual buildings and provides a context for a general discourse about the regeneration of the city centre, its transformation to a sustainable model, and discusses how urbanism is affected (and can be expected to be even more affected in future) by the paradigms of ecology. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the amount of polymer used in oil field increases year by year and the development results turn worse, people started to pay more attention to the technologies which can improve the polymer flooding recovery of class II reservoirs. Polymer flooding efficiency can be enhanced through methods such as detail geologic analysis, project design optimization and strengthen procedure management with applying mature supporting technologies. In this paper, the necessity of improving the polymer flooding effect of class II reservoir is introduced. The technologies to develop polymer flooding efficiency are proposed. The applying results of these technologies show that meticulous reservoir simulation and deepen recognize of structure and reserve and residual oil distribution are the base of improving polymer flooding efficiency. Optimizing polymer injection design to match the oil reserve is the key part of improving polymer flooding efficiency. Deepening technology research and building workflow of different measures and adjustment technologies at different production stages are efficient ways to improve polymer flooding efficiency. Insisting on the comprehensive adjust pattern of "normal molecular weight with normal molecular concentration, individual design, scale injection, profile control in time, adjust with time" and strengthen procedure management are the predominant guarantee of improving polymer flooding efficiency. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The application of water pinch technology to integration and optimization of the water system was reviewed, and engineering application examples of water pinch technology were introduced. The water pinch technology is simple and intuitive. Besides, it could achieve optimal solution for a single impurity system. But for multiple contaminants system, this method will no longer apply. Taking into account its limitations, the possible optimization solutions to application of water pinch technology in combination with other types of analysis tools in enterprise water system were put forward. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Crop growth simulation models can be useful in evaluating the impacts of different tillage and residue management operations on the changes in land productivity and soil-water balance components. They offer a potentially valuable set of tools for examining questions related to performance of conservation agriculture. This can be both to improve our understanding or conceptualization of processes and to improve quantitative predictions for use by agronomists, growers, policy makers or others. We applied the new Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) version 4.5, an improved crop growth simulation model, to three conservation agriculture treatments and one conventional tillage treatment data from a field-scale study in west Henan region of China to predict winter-wheat yield, leaf area index and soil-water balance. The site's average annual precipitation is 632mm and it had a winter wheat-fallow-winter wheat rotation. There winter wheat planting in October and harvesting in next year June. The model was calibrated using 2005-2006 winter-wheat crop data from field experiments of the four treatments. The treatments were: (1) decreased tillage (DT): mulching of 10-15cm height straw and one ploughing operation to 25cm depth on July 1st; (2) zero tillage (ZT): zero tillage with 35-40cm height straw mulching; (3) subsoiling (SS): 35-40cm height straw mulching and subsoil to 40cm depth on July 1st; (4) conventional tillage (CT): 10-15cm height straw mulching and two ploughing operations 20cm deep on July 1st and October 1st. The DSSAT satisfactorily simulated the four treatments' variations in winter-wheat yield, leaf area index and soil-water balance. There was better agreement between observed and predicted yields (the error absolute values were less than 3.95% and the error mean absolute values were less than 2.78%). The mean value of root mean square errors (RMSE) for simulated leaf area index (LAI) and soil water storage were 0.41cm2·cm-2 and 0.08cm3·cm-3 for DT, ZT, SS and CT, treatment respectively. The predicted water use efficiency for the four treatments were 15.85, 15.40, 16.58 and 15.81kg·mm-1·ha-1, respectively. These values were close to the values calculated from field measured data (16.82, 14.44, 16.86 and 15.66kg·mm-1·ha-1, respectively). Although the analysis results show us that the DSSAT V4.5 is well suited for simulating winter-wheat growth in the West Henan region of China, these results are preliminary and based on only one year of experimental data and four treatments and further long-term analyses need to be carried out for improving the understanding of the conservation agriculture cropping systems in the west Henan region of China. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={We employed catastrophe theory and entropy method to measure and compare the environmental performance and economic performance of 40 listed companies from the thermal power and steel industries in China, to explore their relationship. The results showed that the environmental performance of the steel industry was less than that of the thermal power industry, but their economic performance was similar. This means that steel industry has had lower resource use efficiency and more pollutant emission, and has a larger potential to saving resources, energy and environment pollution. Both the correlation analysis and regression analysis indicated that there existed a significant positive relationship between the environmental performance and economic performance of the steel industry and thermal power industry in China. This means that it is very possible to gain win-win situation of these two performances, if the listed companies tend to make advanced production and environment protection activities come into a benevolent cycle, by means of technology upgrading and transformation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To cover the main contributions and developments in solar thermal collectors through focusing on materials, heat transfer characteristics and manufacturing challenges. A range of published papers and internet research including research work on various solar thermal collectors (flat plate, evacuated tubes, and heat pipe tube) were used. Evaluation of solar collectors performance is critiqued to aid solar technologies make the transition into a specific dominant solar collector. The sources are sorted into sections: finding an academic job, general advice, teaching, research and publishing, tenure and organizations. Provides information about types of solar thermal collectors, indicating what can be added by using evacuated tube collectors instead of flat plate collectors and what can be added by using heat pipe collectors instead of evacuated tubes. Focusing only on three types of solar thermal collectors (flat plate, evacuated tubes, and heat pipe tube). Useful source of information for consultancy and impartial advice for graduate students planning to do research in solar thermal technologies. This paper fulfils identified information about materials and heat transfer properties of materials and manufacturing challenges of these three solar thermal collectors. Describes some changes made to improve the environment which have had unforeseen and adverse effects on safety and the reasons why we need more case histories. Also discusses the reasons why there are no permanent solutions to safety problems and the reasons why senior managers should become more involved in safety problems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The paper analyzed the organic agricultural spatial organization of headquarters, processing factories and bases in China by the end of 2012, which reflects the overall development level of the enterprise network is low, and the organizational structure shows an inverted T type distribution. Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Shandong and Sichuan provinces scale the highest level. Regional organizations are quite different on spatial distribution, while strong networking provinces mainly gather in the east coast, northeast and west regions, and due to the strength of the dominant organizational functions, provinces can be divided into seven types, such as headquarters-type, base-type, headquarters-processing type. Natural resources, geographical embeddedness, institutional environment, flexible production level and regional innovation capability are the five drivers of spatial organization, and measures can be taken to develop organic agriculture from four aspects of policy guidelines, strategic planning, marketing planning and technical guidance. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Water quality control and pollution prevention of Poyang Lake have become important problems set before Jiangxi Province. To keep good water quality of Poyang Lake, a series of pollution-preventing strategies were studied. In order to prevent point source (PS) pollution, industrial types and layout, management measures and production technique should be improved. Strategies to prevent non-point source (NPS) pollution include four aspects. First is to transform part of NPS pollution to PS pollution by rationally laying out industry system. Second is to construct spatially harmonious and reasonable landscape pattern. Third is to reform conventional agricultural production by using advanced chemical and biological technologies. Fourth is to carry out Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Low-impact Development (LID) by learning and innovation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Nuclear tracer technology is quantitative and it has a high priority, which provides a unique method for understanding the mechanism of urban soil and water loss. 137Cs + 210Pbex combination tracer was applied to study the characterization and evaluation of soil Erosion in Shenzhen. The results indicate that the following: 1)Disturbances from urbanization has greatly changed surface soil in Shenzhen.137Cs background inventory in Shenzhen range at 99 Bq/m2-653 Bq/m2. 2)210Pbex background inventory increase with altitude rise, which is attributed to the movement of water vapor. 3)Soil erosion in Shenzhen has a wide distribution area and exacerbated by severe human disturbance. Land development and steep orchard are key factors that influence urban soil and water loss. 4)Shenzhen should strictly carry out projects for soil and water conservation, such as returning steep slopes into forests and grasslands, and other ecological management reforms. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The good match of IT and business is an important prerequisite to ensure business strategy and the value of enterprise information investments. With the intensive application of IT and the rapidly changing of environment, the match of IT and business should be more concerned about its dynamic characteristics and evolution law. Based on the research analysis of IT and business matching, the strategic alignment model (SAM model) and the business-IT strategic alignment maturity model (LAM model), the paper introduces the dynamic capabilities to build an IT and business matching and evolutionary path model under the action of dynamic capabilities. In the model, nine paths and four steps are proposed to describe the matching and evolution of IT and business. The roles of dynamic capabilities are explained in describing the matching and evolution paths, such as perception, capital-and technology path dependence, learning, dynamic feedback, resource restructuring and reconfiguration, team, coordination and innovation etc. It has a strong reference to the deep research of IT and business alignment, matching and evolutionary path and the enterprise information technology applications. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The driven model explains the process of IT capabilities which includes the classifications of IT capabilities, the external environment chances and threat, induction and feedback, integration and reconstruction of resources, the strategy fit and integration. The IT capabilities evolutionary model is abstracted from the process of driven model, and it explains the IT capabilities evolve into new IT capabilities after a cyclic process of old IT capabilities effects. The two models also build a structure of IT capabilities which can be used in assessing the enterprise IT capability system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper seeks to focus on a combined waste (or: wastewater)/energy system in the deep green housing district. An innovative mixture of "red and green" development is presented, together with a concept of building integrated decentralized technologies for wastewater and organic waste treatment with energy and nutrients recovery. The concept is called sustainable implant. It is important to change the general attitude towards the different components of design, development, use and management of urban areas. A way to do so is the "interconnection" of different themes and cycles within cities. An example is the linking of sanitation to energy and food production. The paper shows the potentials of integrating solutions concerning energy and sanitation flows as near as possible to its origin of use and/or production. Introducing the analogy of the functioning of buildings (with respect to energy and sanitation flows) with that of a parasite. The system layout and the dimensioning backgrounds are explained in this paper. Additional emphasis is put on maintenance, conservation and administration of the integrated whole, and the possible consequences for the district and its inhabitants. There are scale limitations concerning the proposed (and realized) systems. Besides that there is a matter of a unique situation with an "intentional community". Although two similar systems, however small, have been realized, no other project (in process of realization) can be found worldwide in which there is a linking of urban agriculture, waste(water) treatment and energy production at the scale of an urban district. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Delay and packet loss caused by the basic mobile IPv6 handover protocol can not guarantee the service quality of real-time communication. In order to improve the performance of fast handover of the mobile IPv6, we proposed a fast handover scheme based on hierarchical mobility which combines micro mobility and the link layer trigger. By shielding local mobility of the mobile node, the scheme can greatly reduce the signaling information traffic from mobile node to HA and CN. Through the link layer trigger mechanism, the scheme builds a tunnel in advance to avoid packet loss. In order to verify the performance of the proposed scheme, we did some simulation experiments in the NS-2 environment. The simulation results show that the scheme reduces handover delay and packet loss effectively. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the era of rapid growth and high competition, a company must possess an information/knowledge advantage in order to hold the upper hand in the industry. Therefore, the company has to continuously monitor its competitors in order to get enough information and convert the information into competitive knowledge. Although information technology has been used in many areas and has many successful examples, it is rarely the case that information technology was used for the task of competitor intelligence. Accordingly, this study describes the Enterprise Competitive Intelligence System. Competitive Intelligence (CI) is one of the key factors for enterprise risk management and decision support. However, the functions of Competitive Intelligence are often greatly restricted by the lack of sufficient information sources about the competitors. Competitive Intelligenceaims to monitor a firm's external environment for information relevant to its decision-making process. The article describes the concept and the functions of the Enterprise Competitive Intelligence System, discusses the principle of its construction, and also discusses the construction process and the awareness of CI. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is widely used in enterprise production scene. But most manufacturing execution systems are expensive and mostly for the continuous production-oriented enterprises. Thus, they are hardly applied to a large number of existing discrete manufacturing enterprises. For discrete manufacturing companies, on-site processing is complex such as the planning and scheduling. This paper proposes a concept that is the use of advanced enterprise information management and designs a CIMS technology for discrete industry. The system is capable of real-time monitoring of discrete manufacturing companies in the products of the process of production and production data collection. The completion of the automatic production scheduling is achieved, providing a variety of enterprise project management module upper and greatly optimizing various production resources of the enterprise configuration. In practical applications, it has received very good results. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

And no existing works on real-time scheduling have taken into account all features of WIA-PA. So, in this paper, we propose an algorithm to schedule transmissions under real-time constraints for WIA-PA star-mesh networks. The algorithm is based on hybrid centralized and distributed network management, so it can quickly determine how to schedule transmissions. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast and efficient. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In order to accelerate the transmission speed of a large number of documents in file transmission system, achieve fast recovery and restart the transmission in the case of accident, this paper presents a fast task queue management method. By establishing task file transmission queue quickly, and making use of fault recovery module, fast task queue management software not only recovers files effectively which transfer failed unexpectedly, but also realizes saving and restoring rapidly in file transfer system. The software has three functions: the file status real-time monitoring, reading the breakpoint recovery and system log. Test results show that the software improves the efficiency of task management and builds task lists quickly. It also recovers task queue to the breakpoints quickly which are failed to execute at the last time, and continues to perform the task when a fault occurs in the task queue. The software runs steadily, especially, the design idea of the software which has great value in engineering application is instructive. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The multilayer structure hardware system including monitoring management, control layer and field directors is designed. These deficiencies are improved by the way of adopting speed adaptive PID control algorithm, the integrated design of spraying mechanism and automatic cleaning technology. The key technology and algorithm are validated experimentally. The results show that the dust suppression proposed can be saved from 20% to 30% compared with traditional spraying system.

abstract={Performance boosting of modern computing systems is constrained by the chip/circuit power dissipation. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been applied for reducing the energy consumption by dynamically changing the supply voltage. One can apply an adaptive scheme by computing a threshold speed of the supplied voltage, and adopting greedy online DVS scheduling algorithm when the voltage exceeds the threshold while choosing a conservative speed on the contrary. This paper presents an algorithm to determine the threshold speed. The proposed algorithm allows to obtaining the threshold speed for the adaptive DVS scheduling algorithm more efficiently. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With inappropriate design or construction, the functions and service life of buildings begin to decline from the day of official use until they are demolished and resulting in extremely high cumulative cost throughout the building life cycle (BLC). However, the development of building information modeling (BIM) provides a solution for short BLCs and massive cumulative cost caused by errors occurring during the building design and construction phases. BIM is an innovative technique applicable to building design and construction management that has been vigorously developed in the construction industry. The development of BIM technology is now a global trend that can not be ignored, similar to 2D CAD before. BIM can be further developed into several aspects and applied during the construction phase, most important of all, enhance the overall building functionality and save operating cost throughout the BLC. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The program enables ITS to systematically identify, evaluate, manage and improve their environmental performance and practices. One of the program issue is energy saving in building. The energy saving effect of an air-conditioning system retrofit project is analyzed by Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs) Method. These ECOs are assessed in terms of their costs and benefits, and an economic comparison to rank the various refrigerants. Finally, an Action Plan is created where certain ECOs are selected for implementation. Civil Engineering Department has a responsibility to design infrastructure and green building concept planning. This department also has the largest energy consumption in this faculty comparing the other department. The energy consumption on this Department is 60829 kWh/month. The value of IKE is 13.39 per month with the largest electrical energy consumption in air-conditioning system is 57% from total consumption. The energy used of air-conditioning sytem is 523.692 kWh. The energy saving opportunities by CFC retrofitting with hydrocarbon can save its power consumption about 20%. It also saving cost and reducing the electricity bill of 1643871.838 IDR/month.

abstract={CFG pile has been widely applied as one of the common ground treatment techniques. As a concealed work, the construction quality of pile foundation not only relates to the success of the project, but also concerns the benefits of thousands of households. Only strengthening the supervision and management during the construction and strictly designing and specifying CFG pile can ensure the construction quality of CFG pile. But most researches focus on operating mechanism and theoretical analysis, and there are fewer researches about the construction of CFG pile. The real construction of CFG pile has no specified operation and lacks of the construction guidance, which not only causes great problems and has great influence on the intensity of CFG pile, but also makes the real pile body have great difference from the design requirements. Therefore, the study on construction of CFG pile in the paper has great significance. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Smart industrial park energy efficiency management system is used for solving the demanded side electric power management problem mainly in terms of scientific management. In this system, the data of electric power, electric power quality, and electric energy is acquired in real time by installing an electric power management monitor in the main load points, so as to analyze electric energy efficiency and energy consumption. A large amount of data can be obtained from the system, and if these huge amounts of data are of a value can be further analyzed, finding the unknown factors affecting enterprises' energy consumption, equipment performance, and operational efficiency, and the disadvantages of the traditional data processing method. Therefore, an advanced data analysis and processing tool (i.e. efficiency data mining technology) is introduced for analyzing and mining large amounts of data monitored with the smart industrial park system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={At present, one-dimension codes are printed on food packaging, so is the bar code on the same kind of food. However, this method can only manage the same type of food. It cannot manage the single food. For this reason, we can't achieve the goal of tracing to the food source. The model of Internet of Things mainly includes the perceptual layer, the transport layer and the intelligent application layer. The perceptual layer recognizes objects through sensing devices and collects the exclusive identification on food, then connects to the wireless network or wire network through interface. In transport layer, by means of internet or LAN, the data which has already been collected by the perceptual is transferred to the information center or network administration center for processing and analyzing. According to the needs of tracing to food, the application layer source provides service call interface or API platform service to reach the depth integration of the information and traces to food source management, which can realize the intelligent operation management of food manufacturing and circulation. This paper proposes the Sense organs of Internet of Things, which is composed of the two-dimensional code technologies, RFID technology and sensor technology, wireless sensor networks or wired sensor networks composed of "nervous system". And then it makes full use of the variable information printing technology to print exclusive code on the single food packaging, and uses RFID reader register large quantities of food rapidly. It also uses database management software and user terminal to track the whole process of food production and circulation, in which food can be checked and inquired by network search platform. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In digital printing process, the color reproduction quality is no longer determined by printing sequence, trapping, solid density and etc., since the technique is different from traditional printing technology. In order to analyze the effects of paper on color reproduction quality in digital ink-jet printing, three kinds of commercial paper were selected and a set of experiments were carried out by using color management technique to simulate the digital proofing. The density and chromaticity of both primary color and composite color in each printed were measured. The effects of paper's characters on shadow, mid-tone and highlight were analyzed and discussed. Finally the influence on color reproduction quality principle, including chromaticity and absorbing characteristics of paper, was revealed. The conclusion has certain significance in directive function in ink-jet printing. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this paper, the semi-physical simulation technology is introduced with the design and implementation of a semi-physical simulation test bench. A certain low-speed marine diesel engine of high pressure common rail (HPCR) electronic control system is taken as the subject of the test bench. In order to retain the functional and structural features of the HPCR electronic control system, the essential components are in consistent with the target engine, and some auxiliary parts are simplified and reformed. Specially, a real-time simulation model is built based on the principles of Mean Value Engine Model and cylinder moving method, which captures the requirements of ECU, such as the crank angle, the exhaust valve stroke signal, the scavenging pressure and so on. Therefore a closed-loop control system is accomplished including a real-time controller deployed in the simulation model, ECU and the executing agency of HPCR system. Additionally a monitoring management system is developed for the test bench with the functions of acquiring signals, monitoring parameters, storing data, alarming and etc. Finally, some tests are finished in the test bench and through analyzing the experimental results, the test bench can perform the characteristics and functions of the HPCR electronic control system. The semi-physical simulation technology can be used for the functional verification and performance test of HPCR electronic control system for the low-speed marine diesel engine. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The interests of various economies in improving and expanding the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have thrived for a few years, particularly in the automotive sector. Although there are several supporting programs, SMEs face a large number of issues in their operation and performance. One of the successful techniques towards achieving collaborative relationships and problem solving in SMEs is through supply chain integration. Many enterprises have realized the benefits of integration among supply chain members. Supply chain management has become an effective strategy for boosting competitiveness. However, there are a few reasons that put off automobile SMEs from completely performing supply chain management. This study combines literature and findings of a questionnaire analysis to urge facts and knowledge regarding the importance of supply chain management and challenges of automotive SMEs in enhancing their collaborative relationships and effectiveness through SCM. In addition, this study observed that top management, work culture and attitudes of staffs and technologies being traded are among the significant impediments to well-integrated relationship between SMEs. Finally, the study concludes that SMEs need to fully adopt SCM to meet potential advantages and control their performance. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Every industry, organization or individual needs to be minimize their expenditure, time and fatigue and maximize their profit in supply chain. These goals can be achieved through automation by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Zigbee wireless communication technologies, which is easily available in the market. Basically RFID technology is used for automatically tracking, locating or identifying the entities. It can easily integrate with low cost low power consumption Xbee (Zigbee) device, which is used to increase the communication range by large number of node deployment. RFID-Xbee network integrates with Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) Graphical User Interface (GUI), which gives real time information of supply chain at single control panel. The integrated communication model proves the near field inductive coupling and can be used in supermarket for item pricing, office automation, security system, and car parking. This system confirms the concept of real-time locating system (RTLS) in an indoor environment. The impact of RFID and Xbee network communication model enhance the read range of RFID reader, so that out of range items can be tracked easily without additional RFID readers. The benefit of this system is to maximize profit, reduce human intervention and minimize waste. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

This is achieved by the combination of various types of handling equipment or locomotors system, causing the anthropomorphic robot character, the different types of computer equipment, or logical, which determines the intellectual functions thereof. The robots operate in a specific environment, the characteristics of which may remain constant or variable over time. While battery technology is of great interest for mobile robots, but it is not reliable in the time, there are several strategies for the storage of energy (fuel cells and the micro-fuel cell), as well as strategies for harvesting energy from the environment in various ways and energy management using sophisticated control techniques to improve power supply costs. One of these strategies is to use solar energy to power mobile robots. The solar cells appearance is due to the need to supply power spacecraft since not require maintenance for a period of time. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With analysis of the current competitiveness of sporting goods industry in China by means of value chain theory, it can be concluded that even though China's sporting goods industry has reached a high level in production scale and capacity, it suffers severe weaknesses in marketing management and technology research and development and lies at the bottom of the "Smile Curve", with "strategic links" beyond its grasp. Finally relevant countermeasures and suggestions are proposed. China's sporting goods enterprises have been suffering both from price rising of raw materials and from international trade technical barriers since 2006 in which the textile export rebate rate in China was lowered by two percentages. Under the influences of increasing non-trade barriers, including overproduction, more competitive exports, appreciation of RMB, the US subprime lending crisis and anti-dumping investigations and rising domestic labor cost, export profit margin of sporting goods industry will surely encounter constant declines with on changes in production and export model. Therefore via professor Micheal Porter's global value chain analytic method, this paper analyzes the advantages and weaknesses China's sporting goods industry possesses in value chain and propose suggestions on how to transform China from a major producer into a competitive one of sporting goods. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In order to ensure the high performance, the high reliability, the high availability and the high service quality of network, fault management has become an urgent problem to be solved. The application of Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is recognized as an economically viable network fault process technology. To meet the demands of network fault management, this paper presents an association analysis and processing strategy for network events based on the combination of RBR and CBR. The network events are firstly passed through pretreatment module, the useful ones are saved for the following processing. Then, the first processing strategy which is more appropriate is select by RBR/CBR selector. Besides, a new CBR processing strategy is proposed by this paper. By the use of the algorithm based on the preliminary screening and the calculating of variance, the processing efficiency of CBR improved. At last, if the alarm event is not been solved, the system will alarm the related people and the solution can be used to rich the rule base and the case base. Based on these steps, experimental results are given to verify the proposed strategy. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of computer network technology, Java has a fairly extensive use of die circumference. Especially in recent years, the development of the smart phone system is also stimulated the use of the Java language. In this paper, Java server is mainly divided into two categories JSP server and Java EE servers. Java EE function which has more features than perfect JSP servers. Application server is a chief platform of Web-based application. J2EE is a standard of enterprise-scale application server. In this paper J2EE is analyzed from the point of view of software architecture and Java-based application development. Some defects of J2EE are pointed out, such as J2EE being unable to support version management and it having diverse concepts and notions due to its multi-tier architecture. Furthermore, a light weight application server—J Web Frame is developed, which overcomes some problems of J2EE. © 2014, Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={As an organization s strategy to manage the employment relationship, high-performance work system (HPWS) may lead to superior firm performance and favorable employee outcomes through cultivating the relational aspects of employee’s psychological contract. In this study, we investigated the processes (mediation and moderation) linking HPWS and outcomes at both the organizational and individual levels. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis on a sample of 1129 employees from 92 firms in the Pearl River Delta of China indicated that HPWS was associated with increased firm performance and decreased turnover rate at the organizational level, and relational contract fully mediated the cross-level relationships between HPWS and employees affective commitment and in-role performance at the individual level. In addition, perceived supervisor support moderated the HPWS and relational contract relationship. We discuss theoretical and practical implications to end of this paper. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

With the development of power electronics and variable frequency speed adjusting technology, electrical propulsion marine will be the most important aim of the marine research. Due to the high propulsion power and the adding of high new electrical load, more requirements about the management of marine power are needed. Power blackout is one of the most important technologies when managing the power of electrical propulsion marine. The semi-physical simulation research on power blackout of electrical propulsion marine is first proposed. The mathematical models of power generator equipment and main power consumption equipments are built and analyzed in this paper, and it is subsequently verified experimentally. After research and verification, the algorithms in this article can unload fast and black out the power. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The essay adopts literature and logic reasoning to study development status of sporting goods industry in China and factors influencing core competence of sporting goods industry in China. The study holds that active building of human capital, enhancement of technology innovation, improvement of management system, building of enterprise culture, and mergers and acquisitions of knowledge alliance among enterprises are the major countermeasures for sporting goods enterprises in China to enhance core competence and resist market risks. China is the world's sporting goods manufacturing country, but not the sporting goods power. In total exports, about 50% belongs to the processing and 40% general trading, but the real domestic brands are rare. The export benefit is low. Enterprises technology innovation ability is weak, especially in design R&D capacity, brand management capability and quick response capability. If we stubbornly stick to the existing industrial structure and continue the extensive mode of growth, it will be necessarily hard to undertake the increasing pressure of international competition and the development path will be narrower than before. In today’s economic globalization, especially, they are not only confronted with the competition of domestic enterprises, but also the challenges of sporting goods strong enterprises internationally. Therefore, the understanding of current situation of sporting goods, the thorough analysis of factors influencing core competence of sporting goods enterprises, the cultivation and promotion of core competence of sporting goods enterprises in China constitute an important task of us that needs in-depth study. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Power-grid crisis management game is a zero sum game between power grid crisis manager and crisis event. Power-grid crisis game belongs to the “dynamic game of incomplete information”-“dynamic Bayesian game”. Dynamic Bayesian game process is just analogous to the process of crisis management of power grid, which fully demonstrates that the process of power-grid crisis management is a course of repeated game. between crisis manager and power-crisis, also a constantly optimized process. This article mainly studies: the specific characteristics of dynamic Bayesian game of grid crisis management; the Dynamic game model of power grid crisis management; the calculation of refined Bayesian equilibrium principles. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, construction enterprises’ poor economic performance and the drain of senior technical personnel have been two cause-and-effect problems, which seriously restrict the enterprises’ long-term development, and the existing researches contribute little to solve the problems for managers. Considering the uncertainties of talents resource demand resulting from the difference of Multi-project schedule, a cyclic queuing theory of fixed number of customers was introduced from the enterprise management level. Then the risk loss curve and waiting loss curve could be simulated according to historical data and management experience. Finally, a best method to allocate the shortage of technical talents came out. The model was built throughout the management processes, so it owned not only high theoretical basis but also high operability, and has a better reference on solving the two construction enterprises problems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Active control of turbine blade tip clearance continues to be a concern in design and control of gas turbines. Ever increasing demands for improved efficiency and higher operating temperatures require more stringent tolerances on turbine tip clearance. In this paper, a turbine tip clearance control apparatus and a model of turbine tip clearance are proposed. The active clearance control (ACC) of aero-engine turbine tip clearance is evaluated in a lapse-rate take-off transient, along with the comparative and quantitative analysis. The results show that the resultant active tip clearance control system has favorable steady-state and dynamic performance and benefits of increased efficiency, reduced specific fuel consumption, and additional service life. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Power grid crises at home and abroad happened frequently, insufficient research on power grid crisis management and awareness of “crisis and crisis management” warns the necessity and urgency of power grid crises management. Necessity of finding rational theoretical basis for our studying crisis and carrying out crisis management are becoming urgent. This article proposes the theoretical basis from three aspects: stage-division theory, system theory and structure theory. Stage-division of power grid crisis management can be adopted according to practical study. The outstanding performances of all components of crisis management embody the safe and stable operation of power system. Fragmentation of thinking way in power grid crisis management will hamper the crisis management, and we should establish “systems thinking”- “to see the whole”. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With To obtain implications for supply of high efficiency home appliance, this study focused on boilers in the household sector to analyze efficiency grade, replacement cycle and usage condition of boilers and to examine possibility for introduction of high efficiency boiler and energy conservation. As a result, about 40% of households had grade 1 boiler, about 54% of households had grade 4 boiler, and remaining 6% had other grades. This did not differ much from the product ratio for each efficiency registered on [Efficiency Comparison], an energy efficiency management system. Increasing ratio of consumers are expected to purchase high efficiency boiler as development and supply of high efficiency products are institutionally reinforced. Also, general replacement cycle of boilers was investigated as 9 years based on living conditions, environment and marketing survey on the market. Energy conservation from sequential replacement of boilers other than grade 1 into grade 1 boilers during this life cycle of 9 years was calculated to be 6%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Lead-acid batteries are widely used in all walks of life, the State-of-Charge is the most important part of the battery management system. On account of the strong coupling, multivariable, nonlinear characteristics of the batteries, this paper adopts the LS-SVM method to predict remaining battery capacity. The nonlinear POLYnomial (POLY) kernel is employed to design the LS-SVM. Aiming at predigesting the hardware requirement of the LS-SVM application, this paper uses the deduced induction of the input vector to simplify the POLY kernel, greatly reducing the memory capacity of the practical application. At last, simulation on MATLAB was done to verify the validity of the proposed model, the simulation results show that the LS-SVM based on the simplified PLOY kernel is applicable to battery SOC estimation, and the estimation error can be controlled within 5%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

For that matter it is necessary to take into account non-economic "pure" project risks that are possible in the spheres, which traditional risk management does not consider in-depth. The traditional management of such "pure" risks comes down to estimating the extent of insurance coverage and redundancy in their implementation.

abstract={To deal with the super short-time energy management of microgrid, a mixed-integer programming optimization algorithm combined with genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly, this paper introduced the short-time economic dispatch mathematical model of microgrid. Secondly, a two-layer optimize algorithm is been developed. The lower layer takes no account of power flow constrains, convert the model into a mixed-integer programming problem through linearization techniques. The lower layer gets the generation schedule, and then passes the data to the upper layer. The upper layer takes the power flow constrains into account, optimize the unit output based on genetic algorithm. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a better complementary of the two kinds of optimization algorithm. At the same time, the optimization result also shows the effectiveness of the algorithm. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper proposed a separated-frequency identification method of Li-ion battery model for Electric Vehicles (EVs). The main idea is to decompose the measured terminal voltage and current data in wavelet domain, and then the weighting least squares (LS) algorithm is used to extract the model parameters. Since the signal energy of open circuit voltage (OCV) mainly distributes in the low frequency band, the identifiable wavelet-domain battery model can be approximately obtained by neglecting the high frequency wavelet decomposition coefficients. Furthermore, based on the Akaike’s information criterion, we study the optimum decomposition order of the wavelet-domain battery model. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The closed bay formed by a tidal power plant on the west coast of Korea has caused water quality to change due to nutrient increase and salinity alternation. The nutrients of the inner bay are often kept a balance with the aid of the outflow at the mouth of the bay. Hence it is necessary to minimize the environmental effects by forecasting the potential environmental changes caused by a tidal power construction. Seasonal observations of mass balance in the inner and outer Garolim Bay were performed. The low quality nutrients released from sediments, land and river were more dominant than the nutrients released from the outer bay in the study area. It was observed that the tidal power plant construction made water exchange ratio 57%.Various mitigation strategies such as water gates were studied so that the water exchange rate can be reduced. The change in the water exchange ratio is significantly reduced as the cross-section and the number of water gates is increased. The water exchange ratio was decreased by 8%, which increased nutrients in the inner bay. Results of numerical the nutrients decreased with the 7% increase in the inflow while the decrease in outflow discharges. However, it is considered only 0.2% increase in the entire mass balance of Garolim Bay relatively inadequate to mitigate the environmental impact. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The inherent random and intermittence of the renewable energy resources pose a huge challenge to the Microgrid (MG) energy management systems (EMS). In order to mitigate the effects of uncertainties, we propose a novel two-stage stochastic programming model for the energy scheduling optimization by considering the uncertainties in solar and wind generation, and the plug-in electric vehicles (EV). The random nature of uncertainty is characterized by a scenarios generation approach based on autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model according to probability density function of each random variable. By use of the strategy of scenarios simulation, the stochastic problem is decomposed into the deterministic equivalent problem. The firefly algorithm (FA) is used to solve the equivalent model. The effectiveness and robust of proposed stochastic energy scheduling optimization strategy for MG is valid by comparison with the simulation results of deterministic method. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The rudder and steering gear is the most widely used ship maneuvering equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, steering gear, steering mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO" is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the steering gear failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the steering gear in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure steering gear failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents a new cross-layer QoS routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Basing on the principle of cross-layer design, the algorithm adopts delay, nodes’ load and link quality as QoS metrics. The QoS routing metrics are regarded as heuristics correction factors in ant colony algorithm (ACA). The ants are divided into a number of different populations. Through the interaction of pheromone between multi populations, the routing algorithm searches for the feasible paths in parallel and updates the pheromone in time. To overcome the slow convergence of ant colony algorithm, membership cloud model (MCL) is used to control the randomness of the ants. The simulation results demonstrate that the routing algorithm can guarantee the real time, reliability and robustness of wireless sensor networks. It can also achieve the network load balancing. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Following the development of national economy, environmental pollution and ecological hazards has been resulted from the pollutant discharge and reclamation etc. So it is very important for evaluating the environmental carrying capacity for guiding the environmental management and control. In this paper, a systematic assessment model with detailed procedure for environmental carrying capacity is proposed, based on the combination of set pair analysis method and cloud theory. The membership degree function obtained from bell function in cloud theory is used for connection degree function in set pair analysis method. The normalization means of membership degree has advantageous of improving the reasonability of membership space. The calibration results of case study work well in Tianjin Binhai New District. This shows the coupled model has advantages of concision, easy-operation and high precision of set pair analysis method, and the randomness and ambiguity of assessment indexes’ membership can be reflected in the assessment procedure by using the cloud theory, so the assessment results are reliable and practical significance. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

abstract={Industrial water demand forecasting is needed for the effective planning and management of water supply systems. The paper first made impacting factor analysis of industrial water demand. Data analysis showed that there was a converse “U” type relationship between industrial water demand and industrial value added. There was a negative correlation relationship between industrial water demand and the recycling rate of it. With multiple regression method, industrial water demand forecasting model was established. In the supposed scenarios, we applied the model to predict Chinese industrial water demand in 2014 and 2015.The results were 141.04 billion m³ in 2014 and 137.79billion m³ in 2015. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Remote instrumentation and measurement has always been an attractive area to researchers. Studies on grid-enabled instrumentation system have turned many instruments into resources similar to the computing and storage element. However, the advent of cloud computing further inspires the idea of instrumentation service provision rather than resources. Upon this philosophy, this paper proposes an architecture for instrumentation cloud aiming at guiding the development of the unified platform for remote instrumentation resources management and service provision. The design of the architecture is based on the analysis of requirements for future remote instrumentation system. Then, the use case and related activities of the instrumentation cloud system are derived. The detailed architecture and related function modules are designed according to previous system modeling. Finally a discussion is presented to analyze the potential problems that may encounter in developing the instrumentation cloud. However, most of them are just technique issues and can be solved once technology improves. The proposed architecture is a good guide for future development of on-cloud instrumentation system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, the phenomenon that global is becoming warmer, natural disasters occur frequently, natural resources and energy are decreasing more and more seriously affects the survival of mankind and the normal production and other activities. In this context, the concepts of “low-carbon economy”, “low-carbon city”, and “low-carbon technology” come into world attention, and low-carbon economy become the main direction of transformation of the resource-based city gradually. Therefore, studying problems about developmental level evaluation and strategies of low-carbon economy for the resource-based city has become an important research topic of scholars both at home and abroad.
Facing the low-carbon economic development model, under the background of fully understanding the research status of the resource-based cities at home and abroad and low-carbon economy, the author sum up some problems which the resource-based cities need facing in sustainable development, and put forward concrete solving countermeasures. In order to guarantee the low-carbon economy developing better, the author found a low-carbon economy evaluation index system which suit for the resource-based city, on the base of following the principle of low-carbon economy evaluation index system setting up and the latest evaluation standard. Then taking Daqing city as an example, the author analyses the status of economic industry development in Daqing city and the obstacles existing in the low-carbon economy development of Daqing. At last, it screens 34 secondary indexes, and applies FAHP and DEA method to evaluation. The model gives full play to the features that FAHP can effectively reduce the index weight of subjectivity and DEA is easy to operate and can adjust to the original inputs, and provides theoretical guidance for resource-based cities develop low-carbon economy. Finally, the author submits specific promoting strategies for the resource-based city develop low-carbon economy, which can offer references for the sustainable development of the resource-based city. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Existed conductor galloping can only analyze the real-time state. There is no effective method to predict the conductor galloping state and alarm if necessary in the future. In order to solve the above problems, a new conductor galloping method based on the MEMs 3Ddynamic displacement sensing network has been proposed and realized. The MEMs dynamic displacement sensor is used to sense the distributed galloping information. The low-power wireless sensor network is deployed to transmit data back to the host quickly and realize the centralized treatment. The three-degree freedom model is built to analyze multi-dimensional displacement in the horizontal, vertical and torsional directions. Finally, the conductor galloping is predicted and early alarmed by using measured information sensed by sensors, the calculated data by mathematical model and some key parameters of future weather. The method proposed in this paper has been validated in practice. The predicted trajectory after 2 hours and the actual conductor galloping trajectory are basically identical. The deviation is less than 0.03 meters. This method realizes conductor galloping prediction. It strongly supports the operation and maintenance management of the transmission Line. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Hydrologic responses to climate change have become a great challenge and attracted widespread attention of the researchers. The mountainous Qingyi River watershed in the southwest, China, had experienced significant climate change in the past three decades. It is necessary to investigate the hydrologic responses to these changes. Therefore, the effect of climate change on evapotranspiration (ET), surface runoff, baseflow and streamflow were assessed using Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The Mann-Kendall test analysis was first used to identify the long-term change in precipitation and temperature over the period of 1980-2010. It revealed that there is a significant change in annual temperature particularly in February, March, July and September, whereas an insignificant change in annual precipitation was founded. Hydrologic simulations show that hydrologic responses to climate change were varied from region to region. Surface runoff was more sensitive than ET and baseflow. Monthly variation of the hydrologic processes, especially the change in surface runoff, was mainly attributed to seasonal variation in precipitation. The results of this research can be a useful source of information for the decision making in water resources management and protection. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Logistics management becomes an important competency in today’s highly competitive market; it has been a focus on the research of information systems, which act as the tools to enhance the capability of supply chain network. To compete and survive in this ever-changing global marketplace, individual companies can hardly survive in isolation of their business partners, suppliers, and other service providers. However, the lack of a seamless interchange and efficient data analysis hinders the formation of an effective information infrastructure that serves as the platform for data interchange of the heterogeneous database systems in the supply chain network. This paper proposed an infrastructure of information system that encompasses data mining and workflow management capability by adopting the advanced technologies of Online Analysis Process (OLAP) and workflow management system to facilitate supply chain management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The purpose of the study is to summarize environmental strategies and technologies for promoting better sustainable development of historical villages. The environmental investigation took Huaiyin village in china as a case, put forward tourism exploitation as the most suitable sustainable mode, and established an interactive circulating mechanism of protection, management and renovation. Based on the environmental elements framework, the specific development technologies can be divided into three areas: nonphysical environment, man-made environment and natural environment, including intangible cultural heritage protection, cultural value management, renovation of buildings, public space and traffic, the river system and greening improvement and environmental bearing capacity control. The results show that all these measures contribute to achieve the sustainable mode core – “symbiosis” of historical village’s spirit, morphology and ecology. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In photoelectric micro-power supply integrated on chip, the conversion efficiency of solar cell was lower compared with canonical solar cell. In order to improve the conversion efficiency of the solar cell, three technologies (fabricating back surface field, fabricating surfaces texture and reflector) were adopted in integrated process of photoelectric micro-power supply on chip. The relevant theory of the three technologies was introduced. The optimum schedule of the photoelectric micro-power supply integrated on SOI wafer was proposed. The conversion efficiency of solar cells was analyzed by simulation tools (PC1D). The results prove the conversion efficiency of solar cells was improved from 9. 34% to 13.3%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Various WSN key management schemes proposed so far attempt to satisfy the security, efficiency and operation requirements under the resource constrain of WSN. In this paper, the constraints of WSN and requirements of key management are discussed. Several key management schemes are presented, analyzed and classified. Finally, some unresolved issues and future works on these schemes are identified. The discussion focuses on efficiency, fault tolerant, influence reduction, dynamic management and cross-layer security. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Understanding the chronological change in soil microbial community structure of tree peony garden ecosystem is important from ecological, environmental, and management perspectives. Soil samples were collected from three tree peony garden systems (5-, 12-, and 25-year-old tree peony gardens), and adjacent wasteland at Luoyang, Henan Province of China. Soil microbial community structure was analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method. The bacterial and actinomycete PLFAs increased from the wasteland to 5-year-old tree peony garden and then decreased from the 5- to 25-year-old tree peony garden, and the fungal PLFA first increased and then decreased with the increasing planting years, with the greatest amount found in the 12-year-old tree peony garden. The conversion from the wasteland to tree peony garden resulted in a significant increase in Shannon index, Richness, and Evenness. However, with the succeeding development of tree peony garden ecosystems, Shannon index, Richness, and Evenness decreased from the 5- to 25-year-old tree peony garden. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

abstract={Small watershed is the basic unit of soil and water conservation management in the Loess Hilly Region, and the spatial distribution of different landscapes for land use in small watershed has restricted a variety of ecological processes and ecological benefits of landscapes. This paper combines a geographic information system (GIS) and statistical analysis to reveal the relationship between the spatial distribution of landscape types and topographic factors such as elevation, slope and aspect so as to explore the influences of topographic factors on the spatial distribution pattern of different ecological restoration measures. Gaojianbao Watershed, a typical loess hilly region, is the study area. A land-use map (scale1:50000，2013) of the study area and the topographic map (1:100,000) were used as the base data. The study area is divided into 8 landscape types by the classification of ecological restoration measures. The results showed that: topographic factor is an important factor affecting the watershed ecological restoration, and the spatial distribution of ecological restoration landscapes in Gaojianpu Watershed was significantly associated with topographic factors, featuring obvious vertical distribution. With the rise of elevation, the distribution of landscape types showed the order of ditch protection forest to fruit forest to afforestation (grassland restoration) to barren hills under natural enclosing to level terrace to fish-scale pit to barren hill under afforestation; the spatial distribution of each landscape component was greatly influenced by slope, and the distribution ratio first increased gradually and then decreased; when the aspect shifts from shady to sunny, the distribution ratio of landscapes like afforestation (grassland restoration), level terrace and barren hills under afforestation decreased while the distribution ratio of barren hills under natural enclosing and fruit forests increased, and the landscapes of fish-scale pits and ditch protection forests were basically not affected by aspect. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the fast propulsion of the informatization, a large base of semi-structured XBRL data and structured financial data have been accumulated in various business activities, including production, commercial management, transaction, government supervising and administrating, which is ever-increasing with a relatively large-scale. These huge amounts of business data surely will be distributed on the cloud in the future. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to solve this common challenging problem of how to share the huge number of structured financial data and semi-structured XBRL data. Combining the related cloud computing technology with the XBRL technology, a technical architecture and implementation of semi-structured XBRL data and structured data exchange system based on Hadoop cluster is proposed in this study. The technical architecture has certain engineering value and theoretic significance in the area of big data processing and sharing. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the present financial and economic context, the automotive industry faces new challenges posed by the current crisis. Companies have to ensure that the quality products are delivered on time and in a competitive price. One of the most recommended techniques of quality management by specific standards of the automotive industry for product development is Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP). Product Quality Planning is a structured method of defining and establishing the steps which are necessary to ensure the customer satisfaction from the product. The goal of this paper is to present the results of evaluation of awareness and knowledge the APQP techniques in Polish and Romanian automotive industry. The research method was a questionnaire with indicators to measure the awareness APQP tools. The research was conducted among design and technology professionals in Polish and Romanian automotive companies. On the basis of questionnaire it was performed a comparative analysis of results from Poland and Romania. In this way it is shown which methods and tools of APQP are better known and understood in each country. It was pointed out which tools are difficult to use or there is lack of knowledge about them. It was also shown which methods are most often used in the Polish and Romanian automotive companies. They were also summarized the similarities and differences in the knowledge and using the APQP in both countries. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This article presents the model of the e-manufacturing environment as the multi-agent system. The e-manufacturing system is a joint, multi-dimensional base gathering all required information and providing fast access to data and various analyses needed for a manufacturing control system in a real time. All operations executed at the level of a manufacturing system are related to the appropriate level of a management system, thus it allows synchronizing actions at these areas. Fluent combination of operations realized at various levels of a company system allows to manufacture products of highest quality/reliability with maximum utilization of production resources and maximum adaptation of products basing on actions and decisions made pursuant to actual information from production plant. Applying the multi-agent systems for enterprise manufacturing control system enables automation of many processes which previously required human intervention, such as the inspection and control processes. Creating the environment which enables direct access to all the data coming from the production system and utilization them in a real time leads to a more correct analysis of processes taking place on all levels of the enterprise manufacturing system. Applying the multi-agent technologies significantly accelerates the information flow inside the virtual enterprise. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The researches presented in this paper analyze the influence of the method of production flow management, the method of launching in production and the size of demand from the client on several performance indicators of a multiproduct assembly line supplied on stock. The assembly line is multiproduct type (are assembled 2 types of products that resemble as configuration and technology) and it has 5 workstations with mainly manual activities, that are supplied with parts using a synchronous method. The performance indicators considered were: average work in process, cost per unit, systems reactivity to client demand and throughput, their values being obtained by simulating the functioning of the assembly line in different experimental conditions, determined by the variation of the above mentioned parameters, using ARENA software. The synthesis of the results and their interpretation allow the process managers to take adequate decisions depending on targeted objectives. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Realizing two integration of financial supply chain management from order to settlement can improve the utilization ratio of the fund, and help enterprises better managing the capital cost, and improve the economic efficiency of enterprises. In this paper we mainly use the computer data processing method to improve the financial data processing model, and use the method of function approximation to speed up the convergence of data processing. Combined with the nonlinear fitting principle we establish interpolation function model of financial management, and use VB software to develop and design the financial supply chain management system. Finally, through calculation we obtain the economic benefit of the two integration management program. It provides technical reference for the application of computer technology in financial management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Considering customers who demand quality and competition that responds to such requests, the organization tend to focus increasingly on total quality management -TQM. Although the evolution of the "quality" concept lasts a century, it remains a challenge for all organizations. According to these statements, this paper aims to highlight some aspects of the state of implementation and application of TPM (Total Productive Maintenance), as a defining component of TQM. The questionnaire method was applied as statistical research method used to a sample of 31 companies in the automotive industry in Romania. The objective behind the survey was to obtain as much information as possible about TPM. The data obtained were statistically processed to more accurately portray the current image of the degree of concern for TPM and how the TPM is approached by companies who responded to the questionnaire. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

At the same time, the category of innovation processes includes, market expansion activities, and improvement of: supply functionality, production processes, equipment maintenance, distribution channels, service and, last but not least, the perfecting of the company's administrative and management activities. In this study we aimed to analyze the innovation strategy of firms in the industry in the county of Alba. As a research method we used a questionnaire-based survey. The data collected were subjected to a quantitative analysis. In specialized literature four types of innovation are conventionally defined: product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation and organizational innovation. Product and process innovation are closely related to the concept of technological innovation and are the categories covered in this step. From the study's result we can see that innovation is a strategic priority for managers of industry in Alba County. They believe that the most important skills for innovation is the ability to anticipate the market's development, to attract innovative people and to develop new innovative technologies. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of economy, computer technology with the advantages of real-time performance, and high efficiency has been rapidly applied in the field of financial management. The construction of financial management system, which is of digitization and informationization, becomes more and more comprehensive. How to determine the "optimal cash holdings" is the key and difficult decision for financial management in modern enterprises. This paper firstly discusses the development status of modern computer financial management technology, and then makes comparative analysis of the existing four kinds of optimal cash holdings models. On this basis, it has constructed the optimal cash holdings model with Baumol by the aid of computer technology, and the model has been carried out computer simulation and analysis in this paper. The results show that the constructed optimal cash holdings model can help enterprise finance make reasonable decision, which is very helpful to improve the efficiency of financial management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Cloud computing can improve corporate IT operational efficiency and reduce maintenance costs on enterprise PC terminal after centralizing computing and IT services. However, computing resources centralization makes security control and management particularly complicated. Without moderate isolation and security policy, one computer infected by virus can cause the whole network paralysis in cloud computing. It is absolutely necessary to develop "cloud management system" in cloud computing. In this paper, we analysis cloud management system architectures, build a cloud management system conceptual model, and design cloud management system deployment. We also implement cloud management system integrating a variety of technologies including host virtualization technology, virtual host automatic backup management, virtual host blocking and audit technique, and cloud computing access control etc. The cloud management system can guarantee the security of cloud computing, and provide a more economical and more reasonable solution to the cloud service users. © (2014), Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

This paper proposes that the cloud computing environment is a complex adaptive system of which the service is the service agent. With the emergence of its core, the model of interactions between service agents has been established by synthesizing theories and technologies of various disciplines like System Science, Economics, Management and Computer Science. By using the CAS theory as the technical route of cloud computing environment and its service agents, we can draw the conclusion that virtual organizations will spring up because of the combination of service agents. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

In this paper, taking campus sign system of Xuzhou Institute of Technology as an example, through field research, school staff visits, relevant design information of campus sign system for reference etc., combined with campus culture and service characteristics of the sign system, based on original campus sign system, I make qualitative analysis on service standards and cultural positioning of campus sign system in colleges and universities and explain some of the views and suggestions on the campus sign system redesign, in order to provide reference for the continuous development and improvement of campus sign system. 83% of external information perceived by people reaches the mind of people through visual channel. Vision is the most important and the dominant channel for external information receiving. Campus sign system is a vital component of campus environmental and cultural construction. It is the external manifestation of the campus culture, as a significant carrier of school spirit and educational philosophy. A set of signs system in unique completion will greatly enhance the campus management efficiency. Clarity and fluency of the sign system will promote university environment more scientific and rational. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the current, our country's urbanization process becomes faster and faster, The construction industry developing rapidly nowadays, The water-saving and energy-saving design is particularly important to architectural design. Although the building water supply and drainage industry has made significant progress, still there are many problems in the concrete implementation process. Therefore, in the process of water supply and drainage design, we should take corresponding solutions and countermeasures, in order to realize saving water and reducing waste. Over the global currently, the problems of energy supply tension exist widely. The water resource is also a major problem in the global scope. Since entering the new century, our country's urbanization process becomes faster and faster. The development of construction industry is also increasingly deepened over the years. The amount of building water accounting for the proportion of urban water consumption is also increasing. Therefore, water saving and energy saving in the construction industry must be paid attention to. Building water supply and drainage design, not only satisfies the user's water security and economy, but also gives full consideration to the design of water saving and energy saving. In turn, the design promotes the construction of sustainable development in an all-round way.
Currently, the waste of water resources in China building water supply and drainage system is mainly concentrated in the following respects: Flow produced by overpressure leads to waste water; Low efficiency utilization of water resources; The unreasonable choice of hot water supply way lead to waste of hot water; The water storage system of fire control and elevated pressure doesn't select reasonable equipment; Water distribution appliances and sanitary are not advanced enough leading to the waste of water; Quality problem of the water supply and drainage pipes, valves and other accessories. In view of the current problems existing in the design of building water supply and drainage, the article puts forward some corresponding solutions and countermeasures in order to realize saving water and reducing waste. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The construction period is one of the important accounting indicators of construction enterprises. Schedule length directly affects the economic benefit of construction enterprises. Network plan technology is an important tool for project period management, optimization and control. In the network planning technique, period is determined by the critical path. Critical path is the most important activity set line of project, which must be given special attention in the control and be special guarantee in time and resources. Whether or not take into account the various factors to the duration and critical path, and dynamically manage and control the work, is the prerequisite that the project can realize the benefit, but also a challenge in data modeling. The improvement and optimization of Floyd algorithm, namely the algorithm for the shortest path, which take all the factors into account through establishing a dynamic mathematic model. This model will self correct according to the progress of the project, to do at the time of the maximum degree to the actual data, with the budget data, thus the model itself to maximize meet the specific project itself. The improved Floyd algorithm will be strengthened in the use of network plan, which plays an irreplaceable role in promoting the implementation and optimization of project duration objectives. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Currently, the traffic management technology used in vehicle dynamic weighing is gradually matured. However, in China, the existing technology has not been widely used in practical detection. The main reason is the high cost of the existing weighing system which has to destroy a short road during its construction, at the same time, requires arranging a lot of cables to form a monitoring network. This is not only harmful to vehicular traffic, but also wasteful in manpower and financial resources. This paper develops a wireless smart aggregates array based on the protocol for Zigbee802.15.4 and the passive piezoelectric structural health monitoring (SHM). By measuring the vehicle with various loads, the test is performed to validate the proposed Wireless Smart Aggregates Vehicle Dynamic Weighting System (WSA-VDWS). The experimental results are consistent with the results of actual conditions. The developed system is stable and reliable, which is able to be applied in real-time online tests of vehicle dynamic weighting monitoring. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The key technology of electric vehicle battery management lies in the battery state of charge (SOC) estimation, accurate and efficient estimation of SOC can provide the reference data for the control system of the electric vehicle in time. On the basis of the Ah measurement method, Calman filtering method, open circuit voltage method to estimate method, the estimation procedure to estimate the charged battery optimized Calman filtering method, effectively shorten the calculation process, improve the estimation accuracy, in the normal operation of electric vehicles under the influence of comprehensive consideration about the discharge voltage, battery temperature to estimate the state of charge, the Calman filter optimization algorithm, and its application in the electric vehicle battery management system. The experimental results show that, the algorithm can calculate the real-time high charge state of surplus value, provides a set of effective estimation scheme of calculating the battery charge state.
The core content in the electric vehicle battery management system is determined by supervision and management of the battery residual capacity. SOC index can be used for real-time monitoring of the battery residual capacity, meanwhile, SOC provide necessary reference data for ECU as the enforcement basis of battery management system. At present, the estimation method for the power battery SOC as followed: the discharge experiment, discharge method, Ah measurement method, combining with the open circuit voltage, load voltage, internal resistance method, neural network and kalman filtering method, etc., the internal resistance method is used to detect charged state, which required battery remaining power less than 40% of the rated power, then it can monitor the change of battery internal resistance, so can't fully test battery. The battery must be placed for a period of time, when using the open circuit voltage method test the SOC. The battery remaining capacity can be estimated after the stability of the battery voltage. Therefore, this method can’t be applied to the working battery, at the same time, the open circuit voltage method can't timely monitoring battery internal chemical aging and have a large error on estimation of the battery remaining capacity, which deviated from the basic reference value. Ampere hour measurement is to estimate the remaining battery power by the integral battery current, however, due to the battery current change is too big during the driving process, caused big error estimation. Based on the open circuit voltage method and Ah measurement, a kalman filtering optimization algorithm was proposed by this paper, finally the feasibility of the optimization algorithm is verified by experiment. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

In this paper, the decision tree applying to the situation classification prediction is presented, including the construction of a professional field data warehouse, data preprocessing and discretization, decision tree algorithm and tree pruning optimization algorithm using weights. Through the experiment, the prediction accuracy may reach 95.8%. By use of enterprise operating situation analysis based on data mining technology, we can find out useful information for the enterprise management decision, strengthen the correct judgment in marketing operation and other aspects, thereby enhancing the market competitiveness. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

An IDS agent which includes two different agents was deployed in every node of network. One is local detection agent and another is global detection agent. They complete different tasks of detection. Based on Bluetooth communication technology, Bluetooth scattering network formation algorithm TPSF was employed to construct the cluster layer of sensor network and to finish task assignment of different agents. The TPSF algorithm was improved by limiting the role of nodes to lighten the complexity of nodes, so the IDS agents can work effectively and the safety coefficient of nodes is improved. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Now the popular Struts+Spring+Hibernate framework provides a weak coupling, easily containable, lightweight J2EE software development model which helps to build high-quality Web applications. Through researching of SSH framework and ExtJS framework based on AJAX technology, an integration framework is designed, which is based on ExtJS+SSH ,and can be used to build a flexible, easily extended and maintainable multi-tier Web application platforms. In this paper, a teaching resource management network platform is introduced, which is based on the integration framework. Experimental results show that business operations, the database, and display will be divided completely by using this integration framework based on ExtJS and SSH, in order to achieve a system of weak coupling and high level of maintenance. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Nowadays, health care management is driven by informationization and information technologies are widely used in various types of hospitals. Doctors and nurses are the direct users of information technologies for health care management (ITHCM), as well as the most critical prerequisites in ITHCM implementation. Their acceptance and use of ITHCM can significantly promote hospital performance and enhance core competitiveness. However, different people have different attitude, values and motivation on ITHCM. These factors not only affect employee’s behavior in ITHCM adoption, but also their continued use behavior of ITHCM. Based on the Big Five personality as well as real-world healthcare situation in China, we investigated the impacting factors of ITHCM continuing use, and built ITHCM Continuing Use Model based on personality. We conducted an empirical study to verify the related hypothesis. The results show that Big Five personality affect the willingness of ITHCM continuing use through perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={We design a structured big data management system which can deal with large-scale structured datasets and supports the cross-domain collaborative query. The system employs the HDFS as the storage layer. And it realizes a scheduling engine in reference with the splitting technology of the massive parallel processing(MPP) database. Using this engine, tasks can be split and distributed to different sub-nodes for parallel execution. Through cross-domain query module, users can execute SQL commands on the datasets of different datacenters or network domains. Meanwhile, the system supports the distributed deployment, so as to reduce the construction cost by making full use of existing software and hardware resources and equipments. We test the system functions and performance on a 80 nodes cluster, and compares with Hive. The result suggested that system performance is improved by 2-3 times than Hive and the function designed can be performed correctly. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Topic forum always contains abundant product information such as requirement, quality, and evaluation. It is very significant to use these information in product development and management. Aiming at the product quality issues during its use, a method of extracting product quality information expressed by customers from web forum was presented. The content and its hybrid structure of product forum were analyzed. And the parse form in XML was presented as well. On the basis of these, the technology architecture of extracting product quality feature words from forum was proposed. In addition, the chronological characteristic and probabilistic characteristic among feature words were researched with the consideration of the position, time, and its number of feature word in sentence or forum respectively, and the calculation models of them were constructed as well. Then the connectivity relations among feature words were established. As a result, the key factors that affect product quality can be inferred based on it. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Ecological and water security are the key measures for sustainable water diversion. Green water management as a new technology to achieve water conservation and water purification has a broad application prospects. In this research, green water management such as bench terraces, contour tillage, mulching and stone line was studied in the Upper Du watershed. ArcSWAT model was used to assess effect of green water management on river base flow. The results show that four green water management measures activated the regulating action of “soil water reservoir”. Base flow in export section of Upper Du river basin is increased under different four green water management measures, and especially the base flow increased more obvious in non-flood season. That is helpful to improve the ecological security degree in water resources area. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The problem effective and economical management of the cutting tools is often the factor that manufacturing enterprises do not attach much importance. Any manufacturer of cutting tools states in promotional and marketing materials, and also in many catalogue data about cutting tools, excluding those subject know-how. Among the following data are also recommended cutting conditions and their dependent of durability of the instrument. If the company uses different cutting parameters, knows the durability of knowledge by F.W. Taylor contained in standard ISO 3685, which can be fast deduced, because dependence on cutting speed durability is in double logarithmic in shape of linear graph. What in case that this assertion was demonstrated by Taylor in 1906 was not true? Durability of cutting tool would be different in that case, and it would not be possible to calculate or predict. With this knowledge about invalidity of the Taylor formula for new cutting tools pointed to science and practice by Professor Karol Vasilko, who in its publications published research results to indicate this fact. Article follows the research of Professor Vasilko and provides the opportunity to analytically derive the dependence of T-vc for cutting materials, where Taylor's relation does not apply. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), which integrates wireless communication, sensor, network and embedded technologies, is a new data collection network system. It is a new information acquisition and processing technology. Because WSN can operate in a wireless environment, it can be deployed in areas inaccessible to human beings or difficult to install wired network. It has been widely applied in many areas such as medical, transportation and military thanks to its robustness. The new design of embedded wireless sensor network has resolved the issues of limited monitoring area and difficult control management. The test results indicate that this new design of the embedded wireless sensor network is capable of real-time control management in an expanded monitoring area. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the advance of information technology and the advent of the Internet era in the 21st century, enterprises worldwide have been developed in the direction of e-business and the Internet economy. After Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization and information technology contributed to the development of the Internet, Taiwan became a highly competitive environment for enterprises. To increase competitiveness, enterprises should promote global management strategies rather than limiting the enterprise to one area. The textile industry in Taiwan can be rejuvenated by using information technology and adopting an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. When such a system is adopted, the business-to-business procedures in the industry are not independent from each other, but form a supply chain management system by integrating upstream and downstream operation procedures to reduce production costs and preparation time, increase profits, and create substantial added value. Everest Textile Co., Ltd, which is a textile manufacturer that receives assistance from the Industrial Development Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, was used in this study as an example. The strategies, mode, and benefits of Everest Textile's electronization were analyzed. Furthermore, relevant literature was reviewed to propose a textile industry electronization model, which is provided as a reference for other textile manufacturers in Taiwan to facilitate the overall improvement of the industry. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This research was carried out according to the actual needs of plateau kitchen vehicle. However, these military equipments have played important roles in the military exercises, earthquake relief, and other major activities, they does need urgent improvements in the using process. Among those problems to be solved, drift distortion of pressure cooker signal transmission on account of low temperature of high altitude, inability of achieving accurate control, and untimely feedback of service demand included. The pressure automatic control system of plateau kitchen vehicle which is based on Single Carrier Ultra Wide Band (UWB) wireless technology (SC-UWB), will completely solve the above problems, and the followings are innovations of this study: Firstly, Single-carrier ultra-wideband wireless transmission technology was used in this study, which was in accordance with Chinese Standard and based on chips produced by China. This would satisfy the needs of real-time transmission in pressure and temperature information under extreme environment, and solve technical problems such as signal integrity and communicational confidentiality, and this would also eliminate technical problems such as signal distortion, hysteresis, drift, high deviation repeatability of automatic control system of plateau kitchen vehicle in extreme environment. Secondly, intelligent sensor systems were connected to the Internet of things (IOT).

abstract={This paper proposes to develop method for disruption mechanism analysis of supply chain systems against information propagate fluctuation, information distortion and non recurrent disasters,with an objective of achieving recognition of supply chain disruption mechanism and control efficiency. Disruption knowledge structure preferences will be modeled and evaluated under different types of supply chain scenarios. A hierarchical temporal memory modeling framework incorporating various measures is established, which can be used to better understand the effects of disruption preferences on supply chain planning, and to find a robust solution against disruption scenarios. Simulation includes supply chain disruption management using past disruption scenario of individual phases data will be carried out for HTM training and testing analysis of model parameters. A key feature of this proposed research distinguishing itself from most existing studies is the integration of hierarchical temporal memory technology and the disruption management of the entire supply chain. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Control systems monitor the condition of the rooms (temperature, humidity) using sensors, and the measurement is analysed by a program resident in the memory of a microcontroller which, based on a developed algorithm, makes the decision to activate the actor - an actuating device (heater, air conditioner). The system acts like a robot, which creates the picture of the world with its sensors and then, based on its built-in "intelligence "(a program), performs a specific operation. The only difference is in the appearance; instead of a human-shaped android, we have a "thinking" building. The intelligent building control system enhances the living comfort of the inhabitants and reduces the energy intensity. A characteristic feature is the user's ability to interfere in equipment operation parameters, e.g. to change the temperature. Therefore, control systems feature a simple and functional interface suited to the skills of an average user. It is activated on any device with an internet browser to enable the remote control of the system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To solve the problems of the environmental factor detection and data management in the methane fermentation, this paper proposes a design based on ZigBee and PDA technology. Sensor node with CC2530 as the core can implement detection of oxidation-reduction potential, PH value, temperature, and liquid level. Coordinator node adopts ARM11 and is designed to be a PDA form, which is flexible and easy to use. On the basis of the analysis in ZStack protocol stack, the sensor signal acquisition program is accomplished. Customize wince6.0 embedded operating systems, and transplant an embedded SQlite database for powerful data management features. By using serial communication and multi-thread communication strategies, the Zigbee network data acquisition, acquisition cycle settings, power mode settings, and time synchronous adjustment can be accomplished. As the result of the test, the average packet loss rate of the network transmission is 0.375%. The data comparison charts of sensor nodes with standard instrument detected in continuous 24h are essentially coincident, and it indicates that the sensor circuit has been designed properly, and ZigBee network data transmission is stability, so it can meet the actual requirements of applications. Meanwhile, the system is easy to extend for different scale methane engineering application. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The rapid development of China's high-speed railway sector has attracted significant attention from the rest of the world, particularly those countries which are launching their ambitious high speed railway program to stimulate economic growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Experience of Chinese decision makers, engineers and contractors accumulated in the successful planning and implementation of the gigantic high speed rail networks is of great value to be examined to provide best practices to following projects, not just in China. This study identified and discussed four aspects of best practices in high-speed railway construction in China, i.e., workforce management, technological innovation, land acquisition, and environmental protection based on a comparative analysis of several newly built high-speed railway project cases. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Airport flying area construction is a complex dynamic process. Its typical features including: complex construction process, large construction area, underground pipe trench interwoven and so on. Traditional construction schedule management of airport flying area is based on Gantt charts and network diagrams, which is generated before the construction, not supporting real-time updates. A preliminary exploration of BIM-based schedule management in airport flying area engineering is conducted. Using Civil3D, Revit, Navisworks and MS Project software, the construction image progress model can be established. Manager also can achieve laying on the type of runway, the number of layers, daily progress charts and updates, and to achieve global control so as to improve management efficiency and management quality. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Architectural history of China is all about the forms of mute objects and urban plans as well as architectural technology and spatial art. The role of men in the process of construction is neglected. The detail of the men working on the project should be made visible in the history. Only in this way, we can understand a whole architecture or a city plan[1]. The story of how to start a project and how to manage a project is a very important part of architectural history because a building or a city should not be allowed to construct without a reasonable demand and should not be constructed without management specially a large scale of project. Accordingly, management and historical background should be reflected in the history of a building or a city plan, rather than leaving them as anonymous elements behind the history. In this paper, some examples are taken to exemplify why the role of men is neglected from the state institute to the craftsmen themselves and the importance of the role in a construction. How to manage or determine a project is also studied to exemplify part of the reason why traditional architecture in China develops in this way [2]. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Continuous improvement is a vital component of an effective performance management system. Simply measuring performance will not result in system improvements. Getting improvement in any service requires an educational strategy for linking performance measurement to the implementation of the specific system improvements. The aim of the paper is to identify the effectiveness and implementation of the kaizen programme in an electronics manufacturing company. Customers focus on product quality, delivery time and cost. Because of this a company should introduce a quality system to improve and increase both quality and productivity continuously. Kaizen is a methodology that aims to increase the availability of the existing equipment hence reducing the need for further capital investment. This paper identifies role of maintenance in reducing production cost and increasing plant profit with the implementation of kaizen. Use of the Timed-PDCA concept makes it possible to pursue productivity improvement in the current works including nurturing motivations to workers concurrently by arranging kaizen theme. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Eco Design integrates environmental thinking into product design and packaging including in its production, consumption and disposal of the product life cycle in the supply chain. In today's scenario eco design is very important for saving our environment. This papers aims to investigate the technology, organization and environment factors of the eco design that influence the adoption of Green Supply Chain Management using Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD). Quality function deployment (QFD) is a planning and problem-solving methodology used to translate customer requirements (CRs) into technical requirements (TRs) in the Course of new product development (NPD). In the proposed model, fifteen fundamental requirements of customers are identified and eight main factors of eco design are derived to satisfy the overall requirements as detailed. The importance of the customer requirements and relationship strength were identified as linguistic data. We have collected data for the criteria from the decision makers of the automotive industry. Under different situation the values of subjective data are often inaccurate so we have applied Fuzzy Quantitative Approach to overcome this deficiency of high subjectivity and low reliability. This study shows the fuzzy logic using Quality Function Deployment for easy decision making. So this proposed method shows the final ranking of the important eco design factors that influences the adoption of Green Supply Chain Management in the automotive industry. The final result of paper gives Stakeholder Cooperation is the most important factors of eco design. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Ecological agriculture is increasingly relying on mobile technologies to monitor the growth of plants, however, the traditional management efficiency is low and waste resources. So, a USB coordinator based on ZigBee-Stack is designed. ZigBee is a low rate, low power consumption wireless communication technology, which can be commonly used in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). WSN is composed of hundreds sensor nodes, all of the information from these nodes will be sent to the coordinator, so the coordinator undertakes the task to collect and process data information, and also as the interface of the network with users. The design of the coordinator is based on CC2530 chip, and RFX2401C chip is superposed on it. A software was compiled to test the data transmission distance. The results show that the distance was increased by 40-60 meters and RFX2401C chip uses only two pins of CC2530 chip. So the improved coordinator is more cost-savings and efficient. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={For many years,companies have focussed on quality and productivity of their products. Globalization, competition and information technology development have forced the industries to manufacture the products with low cost, good quality, availability in the market. Integration of all business entities will promote the value of above said criteria. Supply chain management is an integrated activity, which can meet this critical challenge. Supplier, customer and manufacturer are the entities of the supply chain, which are associated with more uncertainty. Therefore, the supply chain requires an effective rescheduling strategy to manage the disruption and uncertainty by updating and revising the existing schedule. However, the literature survey on rescheduling activity is very limited. The present literature review attempts to analyze the rescheduling activity due to the disruption from the supplier, manufacturer and customer. Literatures on the rescheduling environment, rescheduling factors, and rescheduling algorithm are reviewed to get over all focus. Finally, the review suggests that, to meet the delivery schedule with least makespan and without any disruptions the following factors viz (i) delivery capability (ii) machine utilization rate and (iii) stock level are to be considered. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Recent evidences shows that the more and more manufacturing companies are recognizing the importance and necessity of quality improvement if they are to survive domestic and world-wide competition..Day by day technology is changing, accordingly the approach and the techniques to manage overall processes are also renewed. A systematic and efficient way to meet this challenge is the continuous process improvement. The continuous process improvement can be achieved by practicing TQM concepts. The important concepts are optimization of performance, quality and cost. In this paper an attempt is made in an industry to optimize the process parameters of the welding process so that the overall performance of the process and the quality of product is improved. The Taguchi technique uses a tool called Orthogonal Array and a measure of quality called Signal-to-Noise ratio.ANOVA is used to optimize the welding parameters (input parameters) to find the responses {output parameters). The optimized input parameters are used to compare the output responses for both theoretical and actual, those obtained from the profile projector. The actual values are found to be comparable to the calculated values. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Productivity is one of the major factors that affect the profit of any industry or any product. In manufacturing industries, the productivity is showing the efficiency of the production unit. It depends on many factors such as technology, machine, method, management etc. In this study, method of manufacturing is considered and analyzed how it affects the productivity. Productivity is normally expressed as the number of units produced/unit time. Sheet metal forming is one of the major manufacturing processes and used for most of the products. The proper design of die is important in sheet metal forming processes. This article discusses how the Combination Die can improve the productivity. For this study, a product "U Clamp" is considered. The Product requires piercing, bending and parting off operations. The Combination Die is designed and fabricated for the product and tested. Data on operation time, material handling time are collected, analyzed and discussed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The reliability of supply chain network system design and optimization based on the industrial cluster was discussed, that is, the operational platform of multi-objective supply chain network was moved to industrial cluster, so the platform has the effects of both regional radiation and scale of economy. Instead of some static research methods such as former traditional mathematic planning, systematic and dynamic analysis, this paper put forward a coordinative mechenism construction, this mechenism used dynamic simulation method which combined the supply chain system with industrial cluster multi-objective weighing in the region, the mechenism should be cost efficient and satisfy the application in the industrial cluster radiation region, the mechenism should integrate all possible resources in the industrial cluster and consider heterogeneity, layout, nonlinear, limitation and dynamics of the supply chain network system. Industrial cluster can share resources in adjacent areas such as information, technology and other elements. The economy of scale and the economy of scope can be got from the accumulation of comppanies in the same region. As a new model of industrial operation, the supply chain network system has been a key to survival and development in the same regional entities, coupled with industrial cluster management application in the process of economic transtormation and integrating into the global economy in China. However, in the reality the industrial companies getting together is just for sharing resoures and information other than cooperating each other. So the whole industrial cluster was lacked of an integrated effective and scientific multi-objective supply chain network system. This paper took the relationship of supply chain network in industrial cluster as background and started a deep reseach on supply chain network system design and optimization, cost efficiency in an industrial region, coordinative effectiveness etc, put the operational platform of multi-objective supply chain network into industrial cluster, made the industrial cluster having the effects of both regional radiation and economy of scale, this method could support the decision making of designing and optimization of supply chain network system in industrial clustering and enhance the abilities of competition and anti-risk in the supply chain network. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The usage of renewable energy systems increases worldwide due to extinction of conventional sources and also the absence of some serious environmental effects such as global warming, ozone layer depletion etc. These renewable power systems are not able to satisfy the load continuously due to seasonal availability of the resources. A Hybrid Power System (HPS) formed with renewable energy sources are a solution to provide power for stand-alone electrical loads. However, the energy management in HPS is quite complex as it relies on a central controller. This paper proposes a distributed Energy Management System (EMS) to control the energy flow in the PV/Wind/Fuel Cell/Battery HPS based on multi-agent system (MAS) technology. With this concept, a HPS is seen as a collection of different elements called agents, collaborates to reach a global coordination to satisfy the demand in the system. The Algorithm of the Multi-Agent system technique for HPS has been implemented using MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results show that the algorithm is effectively working for a HPS to provide power to the load and control power flow between various elements of the system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={A simulation based on simulink was set up to investigate the performance of marine refrigeration system. For the simulator focused on the operation and management, so the steady state simulation algorithm is to be used to build simulator of the whole system, it gives consideration to both efficiency and precision of simulation calculation, real-time of operation and management is increased. Compressor thermal model is simple, most of that use steady-state model with no iterative computation. Due to the need of teaching and simulation operation, we use lumped parameter method and partition method to establish mathematical model of Condenser, evaporator, expansion valve, evaporator pressure regulator, cold storage and other parts. True-time operation and the appraisal function has developed. The simulation result accorded well with the experiment result. This model precision is high and timely. It was acceptable used in the ships refrigeration system's operation. In ocean going ships, operation and management of refrigeration system is very important. In recent years, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has improved the requirements of the training, assessment of the related personnel. Based on this, the use of computer simulation technology to develop marine refrigerating simulator has become an important means. But the computer simulation of refrigeration device current is the main components of the refrigeration system simulation model [1-4] Or research on intelligent optimization of the whole refrigeration system,and so on [5-6], There is also researches in the refrigeration simulation algorithm [7-8]. That researches are not suitable for the simulator focused on the operation and management. This paper focuses on the establishment of dynamic mathematical model for main parts of refrigeration system.The steady state simulation algorithm [7]is to be used to build simulator of the whole system, it gives consideration to both efficiency and precision of simulation calculation, real-time of operation and management is increased. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In consideration of the current MP2P network disturbance from frequent location changes of the mobile nodes, the limited computing power and storage capacity, this paper proposes a flexible strategy of partition management by assigning different functions to nodes according to some standards, regarding a subnet as a unit and using super-nodes to manage subnets. In order to speed up the data transmission and replacement efficiency, data is processed with partial network coding technology. Additionally, a trans-subnet query algorithm is proposed to link subnets, conduct information exchange between subnets and resource location. Results of the experiment manifested that this strategy can efficiently increase the resource download success rate and hit rate, reduce the average delay, improve the content distribution efficiency of MP2P networks, and simultaneously enhance system robustness. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Porous concrete technology has been used since 1970s in various parts of the United State as an option to complex drainage systems and water retention areas.Porous concrete pavements have become popular as an effective stormwater management device to control the stormwater runoff in pavement. The objective of this paper is to study a pre-review on Porous concrete pavement and it previous laboratory study. From the literature, it was found that, the strength of the porous concrete pavementstill need to improve. To improve the strength of the porous concrete, various additive have been study as a part of porous concrete mix and yetthe optimum condition to produce good porous concrete still not been established. From the previous study, it was found that to prepare the porous concrete laboratory specimen, the use of standard Proctor hammer (2.5kg) and Pneumatic press (70 kPa compaction effort) resulted in the closest properties to the field porous concrete. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Despite being a manufacturing technique that consumes energy and material, machining is often regarded as an important process due to the fact that it is flexible and is able to produce economic parts. However, to gain more cost-saving and enhanced environmental performance, sustainability principles have to be incorporated into machining technologies. This paper presents a case study that applies both crisp and fuzzy axiomatic design approach to construct a hybrid model with the purpose of facilitating the selection of sustainable manufacturing process. By converting numerical terms and linguistic factors into quantifiable score (in the form of information content), the proposed approach is able to produce indicative results and is capable of identifying the most sustainable process among three alternatives. Potentially, such information can be helpful for product development companies which strive to achieve sustainable product realization. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Currently many companies base their marketing strategy around a family of products. Thus, they regularly add new variations to products in order to meet changing market needs, or to attract new customers. Although the basic functionality remains unchanged across products, new features, aesthetic appearance and technologies are incorporated in each new product. This if it is not checked, can generate the "complexity of the product," which leads to a loss of productivity or quality. Thus, the effective management of product variations in design and manufacturing is challenging. The key is minimizing the non-value added variations through models within a range of options without limiting customers. This article discusses the factors that contribute to the "complexity of the product" and this is done through the product line commonality index (PCI) [1], which measures the level of common parts in a product family. A case study of bicycle frame displays its implementation and functionality. The index shows the possibility that the products in a family share parts effectively (modularity) and reduces the total number of parts (multifunctionality). © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={High quality residence is an important guarantee for improving the people's living standards. In order to adapt to the new situation, we have obligation to make residence construction tending to be high efficiency, low pollution, energy saving and more environmental protection. We plan to use the BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology to better control the construction cost, enhance the efficiency of property maintenance, this behavior conforms to the development strategy of energy-saving emission reduction and ecological architecture which advocated by the government. This study will do residence design collision detection; engineering building quantitative statistics; construction management and property maintenance in the whole building life cycle based on BIM technology. With the help of its strong function such as timely 3D display and collaborative network, we look forward to establish a new mode of residence construction and property management. So we could provide a more suitable living space for the occupants, optimize spatial pattern of urban and rural, optimize the management pattern, improve the city's overall carrying capacity. Through this study, we can also accumulated rich experience for the occupation education of architectural design. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Conventional practice on managing information in construction has sometimes created a miscommunication and errors among construction players. Therefore, Information Communication Technology (ICT) has introduced Building Information Modeling (BIM) for managing construction projects effectively and efficiently. Different terms on definition of BIM have been used and expanded widely with different perspectives. The aim of this paper is to explore the notion of BIM development from the year of 1975 to 2013. The methodology of this paper is based on literature review on BIM definitions. The findings reveal that there are six perspectives in BIM development which are design, estimation, construction process, building life cycle, performance and technology. From the development of BIM, it can be concluded that BIM is a new methodology that involves the use of technologies in order to improve collaboration and communication of construction players as well as the management of documentation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The application requirement of Geospatial data is increasing and complex as it is getting numerous as a result of furthering study on geosciences. Based on a deeply research on Oracle Spatial storage management mechanism, this paper proposed a method that applies the graph theory to domain of optimizing spatial query of massive geographical data, and established a geospatial data query model in order to settle a problem of lower spatial query efficiency in geospatial database. Combining with the practical applications, this paper did a conventional spatial query test and a spatial query based on geospatial data model respectively. The result is that the spatial query based on geospatial data query model has a better efficiency than that on conventional method. Besides, this model can greatly improve the spatial query performance and this improvement will be increasingly apparent as the data volume increases. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={An integrating, coordinating and optimization for experts' evaluate opinion method according to naval ship evaluation case study is researched. Ship projects evaluation index system is proposed pointing at large surface naval ship, meanwhile the weights of index of experts' opinion and ship projects are identified. After combining the actual demand of evaluation with the algorithm, a sequence deviation estimating method is formed for estimating the difference between individual and group opinions. Thus a naval ship evaluation platform is proposed which could integrate, coordinate and optimize expert's opinion effectively. Calculation shows this new method system, which mixed the numerical computing and computer iteration technology together, could meet the actual demand of naval ship evaluation commendably. Not only can it retain each expert's original preference, but also consistent the consulting result rapidly. Thus the new method has great applicability in naval ship evaluating progress, with the ability of solving conflict among the expert group. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={According to the operating characteristics of high-power battery pack in practical application, the effects of four factors, which include operating load, state of charge(SOC), ambient temperature and operating temperature, on the temperature uniformity and rising rate of battery pack under natural convection were studied based on Arbin test bench. The results indicate that: the operating load and SOC of battery pack doesn't affect its temperature uniformity, which was deteriorated as the increasing of operating temperature of battery pack, or improved as the increasing of ambient temperature when the other factor is kept constant. The increment of operating load or ambient temperature could result in a higher temperature rising rate, while the increasing of SOC or operating temperature could lead to a lower temperature rising rate, when the other three factors are kept constant. When the operating temperature or temperature differences achieved threshold value, thermal management system should choose proper extent of forced flow and flow field in accordance with the battery pack's current operating conditions, in order to ensure the economy of the thermal management system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This thesis puts forward one optimal adaptive fuzzy control method based on the pure electric vehicle energy management system of the fuzzy control which has been founded already. By adding an optimizing researching model based on the conventional fuzzy control strategy, the thesis can pick up the valuable control rules based on the dynamic programming theory and also can adjust the parameter of the fuzzy controller automatically according to the system operating. These can make the sum of the energy loss reduce to the min. The experiment points out that this method makes the vehicle possess good economic performance in the same driving cycle. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={There are many obstacles exit in the mobile management scheme, it mainly shows in its not high switching performance, excess signaling overhead and too long handoff delay, hard guaranteed quality of service in handoff as well as safety problem. It put forwards a fast handoff scheme which advances HMIPv6 by giving it authority to temporary mobility anchor point (LT-TMAP). The lower level access router is licensed through upper level of MAP, make it a temporal mobility anchor point to give distribute management to mobile node, and describe the implementation process theoretically. In the end, we use the NS-2 simulation tool to build network topology and based on the IPv6 test-bed build in our school network laboratory which I help researched to give a simulation test to that handoff scheme. It proves the handoff scheme can take better advantage of the network MAP resource, has stronger real-time performance, and higher handoff efficiency. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Data integrity is one of the biggest concerns with cloud data storage for cloud user. Besides, the cloud user's constrained computing capabilities make the task of data integrity auditing expensive and even formidable. Recently, a proof-of-retrievability scheme proposed by Yuan et al. has addressed the issue, and security proof of the scheme was provided. Unfortunately, in this work we show that the scheme is insecure. Namely, the cloud server who maliciously modifies the data file can pass the verification, and the client who executes the cloud storage auditing can recover the whole data file through the interactive process. Furthermore, we also show that the protocol is vulnerable to an efficient active attack, which means that the active attacker is able to arbitrarily modify the cloud data without being detected by the auditor in the auditing process. After giving the corresponding attacks to Yuan et al.'s scheme, we suggest a solution to fix the problems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet, it has been an important channel to access, publish and deliver information. Apparently, Internet has been a part of social life. However, our urban public transportation management systems still require to be improved. There are few methods available for people to search public transport routes. The most popular method is asking people or searching on a transportation map. An urban public transportation management system allows people to search public transport routes through Internet easily and conveniently. By collecting stop information on the routes, people can make a better travel plan before leaving home. The main module in the system is the transportation query module, the functionalities of which include route query, stop query, and station-to-station query, and station query; while the management module deals with operation processing on tables, such as insertion, modification and deletion, and responses to questions in guest books. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper designs multi-core and multi-channel physical education (PE) teaching innovation management platform and introduces TIM theory, so as to collect the transmission speed of video signal for different number of nuclei and the number of channels' teaching management platform. It has found from the calculating that, when the nuclear number is 1, and the channel number is 2, the speed of data transmission signal is the lowest, and the theoretical value is 5.6, the measured value is 5.5, namely the theoretical value is consistent with the measured value. When the nuclear number is 4, and the channel number is 8, the speed of data transmission signal is the highest, and the theoretical value is 9.6, the measured value is 9.7, namely the theoretical value also consistent with the measured value. So in the design of PE teaching innovation management platform, it needs to synthetically consider the nuclear number of DSP and the channels number, so as to achieve the effects of optimization design for the teaching management platform. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={JBPM (Java Business Process Management) is a completely-defined, rich-functional workflow engine. However, JBPM is born with some defects. It does not support returning tasks, counter signatures or repeated tasks. Besides, it does not provide a complete application framework, so that it can't be used directly. This paper analyzes the problems JBPM encounters and puts forward a more applicable application framework design based on JBPM workflow engine. The framework provides business logic handling framework, data saving, data validating, and so on. Meanwhile the framework provides a basic solution for returning tasks, random jumps and counter signatures. The framework is well applied in the background project as its main architecture. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper uses EVA investment objective function and benefits to establish the risk assessment model of enterprise investment and financing combination, and expounds the specific processes of computer EVA investment and financing risk management and designs the elimination matrix algorithm. In order to validate the validity and reliability of risk assessment model designed in this paper, the third part has designed numerical simulation of MATLAB, and an enterprise's 2011-2013 financial statements is took as an example to assess enterprise investment and financing risk. It can find that through calculation, the calculation error can achieve good convergence effects in 20s, and obtain the MATLAB GUI visualization window of enterprise investment and financing EVA accounting. It can identify enterprise year EVA profit value by using visualization window, which provides theoretical reference for enterprises investment and financing risk management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={As started late, China's large exhibition venue industry lags behind the developed countries in the exhibition venue construction and management concepts, and lacks of integrated management over the full cycle of large exhibition venue projects, therefore, decision-making, implementation and operational phases are disjointed with each other and all sorts of drawbacks exist, meanwhile, the overall optimization of social, environmental and economic benefits and win-win situation between stakeholders are unable to be realized. This paper takes large exhibition venue project full cycle integrated management model as object of research and discusses the reason mechanism, connotation, organizational methods and information system of the integrated management. Focusing on large exhibition venue project operation, this paper makes a research and analysis on venue project full cycle integrated management information system demands, and proposes information integration transformation models (including integration relationship model, integration element model and integration mapping model) and comprehensively designs the system basic function framework, hierarchical framework and overall running framework, and also proposes key technologies used to realize the system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The faceted classification scheme provides a set of summarized optional information for software component to choose. And the key value pair method uses key and value to express the information contained in software component. The information contained in a software component can be divided into four basic facets, namely, the application field, expression method, using environment, development process. And they describe the basic information, using information, and storage information of a software component. The component management protocol based on URL is defined to represent software component, which can be used for storing, transmitting, and analyzing of software component inside of system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The current methods to solve SJSSP ignored characteristics of SJSSP, which lead to large solution times and inefficient solution. Aiming at the problem, An adaptive Hyper-Heuristics genetic algorithms (AHHGA) is proposed combing with characteristics of SJSSP to solve SJSSP with the objective to minimize make span (minimize the expected value of make span). Four heuristics rules for SJSSP were designed. Portfolios of processing times of job can be seen as a scenario.

abstract={With the development of information technology, distributed file system is widely used in massive information storage. Usually, distributed file system uses metadata server to achieve quick access to files according to directory, thus the organization and management of metadata are the keys to the file system performance. In general, directory subtree partition method and hash algorithm are used by existing mass storage system to manage metadata. However, to solve the problems, like low access efficiency of metadata, ineffective balance of load and poor extensibility, in existing metadata management strategy of distributed file system, dynamic load balance strategy of metadata based on hash tags is put forward, in which the tags act as partition granularity and hot tags of metadata will be hashed again to achieve the goal of load balance. The experimental results in this paper turn out that modified metadata management strategy based on hash tags has greater system throughput and less average response time than the one based on tags. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

But when input models are large complex process models, existing methods have obvious limitations. An analysis method of the change region based on merged Petri model in the paper. Firstly, several complex models are merged into a model with identifiers. Then, an algorithm for extracting the digest from the merged model is given, and the changes are optimized based on module behavior profile. Finally, the suspected changes are analyzed by the traceability of the merged model. The theoretical analysis and specific example show the method is effective. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Global competition has forced enterprises to constantly innovate business administration and product services, in order to dominate markets and to compete effectively. However, the formulation and execution of strategy and the development of products and services rely largely on a concrete management system that can efficiently produce attractive products within the shortest period of time. Project management is an effective way of achieving these objectives. A temporary task group is formed by borrowing personnel from related divisions, without altering the original organizational structure and adding extra workforce. Various team-building activities are used to quickly transform this group of people into a solid project team and to accomplish the specified project objectives as soon as possible. Traditional assignment of project personnel is based primarily on work experiences and expertise and ignores the role that personalities play in the success of the project. Therefore, this study develops a project assignment quantitative model that maximizes the team's personality balance by selecting the most suitable personnel from a group of qualified capable candidates, to increase the possibility of success for the project. The results of the example show that the model developed can help a project manager to form a project team in which the members' personalities are highly balanced, to maximize the project performance. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Since the 1960s, the competition between enterprises has been replaced by the competition between supply chains because of rapid economic development. For the purpose of enhancing the competitiveness of supply chain by improving the level of supply chain management, the resources of enterprises in supply chain should be integrated and optimized, and then managed uniformly. Inventory management is the most important part of supply chain management. The inventory models what we are using have many limitations. The effectiveness of implementation often depends on the accuracy of the accuracy of "market demand forecast". In order to reduce the reliance on "market demand forecast" accuracy to improve the efficiency of supply chain inventory management, we need to have further research on this theory by used of Internet of things to explore right model. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Based on the technology concept and application of IOT, the technology of IOT is applied to the monitoring and safety early warning of bridge health to improve the level and efficiency of the operation and management in safety of bridge. The article discusses the key issues involved in the application, from the selection and optimized layout of sensors, the acquisition and transmission of monitoring data, the architecture and function of the bridge health monitoring system, safety early warning model research of bridge etc. And the article provides scientific basis for decision making in the safe operation and daily maintenance and management of bridges. With the development of traffic, the bridge construction in China has acquired remarkable achievements in the scale and speed of development. However, the bridge collapse accidents occurred from time to time recently, the safety problem of bridge is concerned highly once again. With the change of environmental conditions, the operation of large number overloaded vehicle, aging material with time, the load capacity of bridge is changing, which will cause the changes of some characteristic parameters (such as stress, strain, displacement, vibration, sound) in the key parts. And this will directly affect the safe operation of bridge. In the era of Internet of things(IOT), various sensors and bridge structures may be fused as a whole system through the Internet, which may gather the various sensors data of bridge regularly or real-time, through the data fusion analysis and evaluation to provide scientific basis for decision making in the safe operation and daily maintenance of bridge.

abstract={It is very important to study the groundwater circulation and water chemistry evolution in the management and protection of water pollution. We use the Fluent simulation technology and the isotope tracer method to do simulation on the flow and distribution of groundwater. In the simulation process we set the model of Fluent isotope labeling group, and enter the groundwater flow parameters in the boundary condition, including water viscosity, osmotic pressure, and the average flow velocity. We use 18O isotope tracer method to simulate the water flow. Finally, according to the law of groundwater flow, we predict the evolution rules of groundwater chemical by using the inverse geochemical simulation technology. It provides a theoretical basis for the management and protection of groundwater pollution. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this study, we try to find the possible emission source area of the grey haze through comparing the ground observation station weather data and remote sensing data for the grey haze process that Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region experienced in November the 8-14, 2013 in which the degree of contamination range from severe to mild to severe. The result demonstrates that before the invasion of the cold air, the coverage of the grey haze reach its maximum where south central areas of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei is more severer compared with the south central and peri-urban areas of Hebei province. For the greater intensity grey haze companied by the wind convergence in the surface boundary layer, the result of the MODIS satellite monitoring is consistent with the meteorological station observation. Whereas MODIS satellite monitoring method could make up the shortfall of the meteorological station for the mild grey haze in certain degree. After the cold air, haze primary development area is very obvious, and the starting position of haze in the role of diffusion by the wind is also here, based on this can lock the grey haze emission source area and make concrete origination by using the high resolution satellite. The precise positioning could provide the scientific basis for the pertinent management on pollution control for the local government and relevant authority. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Trusted computing is a hot topic of information security technology research nowadays. It was developed based on computing and Information Systems. At the same time, business processes for e-commerce and Web service applications, suppliers and customers define a binding agreement or contract between the two parties, specifying quality of service (QoS) items such as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and cost of services. The management of QoS metrics directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. In this paper, we discuss the present situation about QoS in the environment of trusted computing. It describes the factors related to each attribute, as well as possible tradeoffs and existing efforts to achieve that quality. The paper also discusses key issues in services level agreements that are used to contract the level of services quality between service providers and users. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Disrup application tive innovations go along with new requirements concerning cost, quality and scalability while the market environment is considered as uncertain and highly dynamic. Many companies form cooperation to acquire competencies and spread the business risk as well as to cope with these new requirements. This leads to new opportunities for value-added networks, as they can be designed to perform best in terms of cost and quality, to handle scalability as well as to define a collective strategy to align the specific goals of network participants. For companies it remains unsure which value-added network to join, which strategic program to initiate and whether the collective strategy of the network fits the corporate strategy of the company. So far there is no methodology that allows network participants to assess the strategic fit towards a value-added network. This paper discusses and addresses the need for action in fit assessment in theory and practice. As a result a methodology to assess the strategic fit of value-added networks is presented. Parts of the strategic fit assessment are: fit in strategic success positions and potentials, structural fit, cultural fit and fit in motives. The electric engine production for electric vehicles is chosen as an example for disruptive innovation and serves as the case for the methodology of network fit assessment. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Effective management and evaluation of on-site supervision staffs in large hydropower project is a key method to strengthen management, improve efficiency, and ensure the progress and quality of projects. A new method based on smart phones and real-time tracking technology was developed to manage and evaluate on-site supervision staffs. The location information of supervisors at the construction site is collected and uploaded to the server by smart phones containing a GPS data uploading application. The server stores and processes the data, and displays the location and the track of staffs on the web page to achieve real-time monitoring. The collected GPS data is deeply analyzed to identify the specific work context of supervisors and to build 3 indicators: Field Work Time, Effective Work Time and Effective Work Scope which are effective indicators to measure the workload. The feasibility of the method was verified by simulation experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method can determine the real-time position of supervisors accurately, and identify their work contexts effectively. Extracted indicators meet the realities of situation. The method possesses abroad potential in large hydropower construction management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The model is composed of some thermal modules including SOFC stack, combustor, heat-exchanger and thermal equilibrium apparatus. It predicts the temperature distribution in SOFC generation system by computing the electrochemical reaction in the stack, the gas flow and the heat exchange through the modules. Checked by the experimental data, the model can be used for system temperature fast prediction with high precision and strong generalization ability, which meets the requirement of the research on the online predictive control design of SOFC generation system. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Through analyzing and calculating the plane footprint, the investigators can get some important feature information such as step size, age and height, etc. However, this way is difficult to apply to reality without any errors in the process of manual calculations. Information management is more complicated in the later, the efficiency is relatively low too. To solve above problems, a testing system is designed and developed to analyze cluster-footprint. This system is based on the LabVIEW platform, which can realize image acquisition, stride characteristics extraction, information management and so on. Actual analysis results show that this system can effectively achieve these functions, working accuracy and efficiency can meet requirements of criminal investigation process. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Concrete in constant access to technology development, intensification of its early shrinkage cracks caused by problems in the early works become an urgent problem. Early modern concrete easily explained reason for cracking of early age cracking depth analysis of the formation mechanism. And on this basis, the proposed early modern concrete cracks crack control philosophy to early shrinkage of concrete cracking on the goods to instruct the control, service and engineering. With the continuous expansion of the scale of construction and people's awareness of the importance of architectural engineering quality improvement of concrete products for its technical, economic advantages, especially stable, reliable, excellent quality by the construction unit of all ages. However, the current use of commercial concrete construction projects were also a lot of quality accident phenomena, the most common problem when the number of cracks, especially the surface coefficient of slabs, walls and massive concrete construction technology and other causes of bad cracks in the concrete problems, caused a lot of unnecessary disputes, some early cracks early detection and early treatment if it will not affect the appearance of structures and usage. In recent years, for the early shrinkage cracks in concrete carried out extensive studies [ 1,2,3 ], respectively, from design, materials, construction and management of all aspects raised a number of measures, such as additional structural measures, mixed with bulking agents and fibers, etc., but cracks the problem has not fundamentally been effectively curbed. So far about the product is still early concrete shrinkage cracks academics keen to study the subject, it is urgent desire to solve engineering engineering problems.

abstract={Aero-Engine health management generally involves a series of activities over the period from the aerospace breaking down until it returning to normal, including signal processing, monitoring, health assessment, decision supporting, human-computer interaction, and so on. As one of the key technology of Aero-Engine health management, fault diagnosis plays a very important role on the safe operation of Aero-Engine. Currently, for effective challenging Aero-Engine health management, a fault diagnosis of Aero-Engine based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) s proposed. Firstly, based on a variety of significant parameters of the collected information, principal component analysis model is established. Secondly, the fault diagnosis of engine operating conditions is realized by comparing the T2 statistic and Squared Prediction Error (SPE) statistic as an engine running in good condition threshold limits. Finally, through the variable's cumulative contributions diagram with the behavior of SPE overrun, the fault variables are effectively worked out. Experimental results show that the proposed PCA method can efficiently come true Aero- Engine health management o and has some engineering applications values. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={University human resources management is an important part of school management. To summarize, teachers can be managed through a set of scientific and effective method to strengthen the school connotation of the construction of the strategic target. For numerous schools, facing more challenge and competition, in the survival of the fittest, the fittest under the natural law of survival and development, to learn the advanced management experience and management technology, has become urgent and important task of school. In the center of the people-oriented, humanistic management of today, human resource management has become an important factor of success of the school connotation development. Evaluation model is widely used in our common life, which can undertake assessment of a decision and personnel factors, and assessment or evaluation algorithm types are also abundant, including the factor method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation [1], the analytic hierarchy process (ahp), and some algorithm based on artificial intelligence (ai), all these algorithms are effective to solve part of the problem domain. The evaluation of teachers' professional ability involve more factors, including some subjective factors, such as personal moral, lifestyle, ambition, etc., and some objective factors such as working length of service users, specialty, education, scientific research, honors won, etc. If we only use the grade staff to do so, the measurement result of a grade may be affected because of personal emotions, and if we simply evaluate from the objective factors, which may lead to stylized, strengthening the results, lighting the evaluation of the masses. So for teachers' evaluation, we do from these two aspects at the same time, setting subjective and objective factors according to each assessment scheme. For subjective factors, we invite the marker personnel to score by our measurement system based on the subjective factors of scores, and for the objective factors, automatic gradings of staff are done according to the set of weights of objective factors, score, and accumulative number of grading in the scheme of the measurement. We adjust the proportion according to the previous results, as well as the evaluation scheme, to get the sorting and evaluating list of the measured personnel. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Food safety has been in the spotlight of the global attention. In 2013, China's food safety supervision policy was undertaken a major reform. China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) takes over the responsibility of food safety management, which in the past was conducted by different government sectors. Under this new management system, how to carry out the practical work has become a new issue. This paper introduces an innovative food safety management mode adopted by Guizhou province. On the basis of latest information technology, food production enterprises, government, testing organizations and consumers are integrated into a unified food safety information service cloud platform. The core technology of cloud platform is composed of food safety knowledge system, testing management system, food safety information publicity system as well as mobile application. The food factory inspection data, government inspection data, testing organization's testing data and consumer's purchasing information are integrated into food safety and nutrient test big data. Utilizing the data to explore the information that is needed by all the parties, this paper tries to provide a solution to the risk exchange problem faced by China's food safety issue. At the same time, food safety problem can be solved through the contribution of different stakeholders. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the development of stream processing technology, achieving load balance of resource accessing becomes one of key problems. However, the existing technologies are difficult to balance the system and maintain the data integrity requirements when large data stream arrive. In this paper, combined with the dynamic load balancing algorithm, we propose a load balancing algorithm of stream data based on correlation analysis (SDCA-LBA). The algorithm analyses correlation of stream data through the window feature statistics. On the basis of ensuring the load balancing of the stream data system, we consider the data correlation. The experiment results show that this method can effectively solve the problem of stream data load balancing, maintain the data integrity, and improve the system data processing capabilities. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={As one of the main characteristics of ICN (Information Centric Networking), in-network caching had played a huge role in reducing network traffic. How to make reasonable use of the limited cache space in order to improve the cache hit ratio and reduce the network traffic had become the focus of the cache management in ICN. Considering users had different preferences in different data types, and the impact of data popularity on the data access rates, a new cache management scheme was proposed for ICN. In the proposed scheme, data were classified into different categories based on their semantic information, and the interest vector of nodes was defined according to the corresponding user preferences in different categories of data in order to address replica placement. Meantime, data popularity was introduced to solve the problem of cache replacement. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme was both feasible and effective in saving the cache space, improving the cache hit ratio and reducing network traffic load. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={For commercial database management system is not suitable for storing sensitive data, the data is often encrypted in application before keeping into database. Using UDF (User Defined Function) can simplify the encrypting procedure, but it can't handle Lob (Long object) data. A schema of enhancing user authentication and encrypting Lob data in ODBC (Open Database Connection) driver for database is prosed. By adding necessary attributes of user authentication and cipher algorithm to encrypt Lob data in ODBC driver, the security of data stored in database is improved. Experiments show that the schema is transparent, efficient, easy to implement and reliable. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To help air traffic controller at aerodrome better control traffic in maneuvering area, a decision making assist system based on plan conflict detection and alerting is proposed. The most important feature of the proposed system is the module of taxi conflict detection. After an aerodrome controller issues taxi instructions to different flights, the module will detect the potential taxi conflict between flights based on the planned taxi routes and therefore alter the controller. Once the proposed system is used in operation, the efficiency and the safety of the taxi instructions given by the air traffic controller at aerodrome will improve, and traffic operation at aerodrome will become smoother and more efficient. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The last few years has seen a massive growth of applications for smart phone operating systems such as Android, IOS. Short message services (SMS) is one of them. Although SMS as an application has existed for a long time, the method for managing short messages is rather outdated and very inconvenient. The is partially because most of the SMS applications are inherited from old fashioned mobile platforms, in which users of mobile phone usually concentrate on basic phone service and demand less for SMS. With the introduction of smart phone operating system, the old-fashioned method of short messages management is not suitable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we first conduct research on modern ways of short messages management, and then a short message services management system for mobile devices is designed. In this new system, more advanced options, such as messages query by date, by sender and sending a message to many receivers at the same time, for short messages is provided. Moreover, to validate our research and design, we implement the system based on Android platform. And we conduct some experiments with this system and test results shows that our system works quite well. With the mobile Internet becoming increasingly important to life, our research is expected to improve work efficiency greatly. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive and high-tech industry. In order to reduce production cycle time and increase production flexibility, the semiconductor manufacturers will expand the capacity in the existed fab and build up new fabs. However, the expandability of production capacity is not infinite since the huge fab scale will increase risk of production management. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the factors which will influence the performance of fab scale. This research uses the eM-plant simulation software to construct a simulation environment to conduct simulation experiment. The experimental environments were divided into two parts and named as high and low product mix complexity separately. Furthermore, three more factors were taken into accounts, which included stability of machine, variation of fab scale and releasing rate. By simulation, the analytical data is collected and analyzed its trend in these different environments. Simulation results reveal the significance of factors under different environments. Based on these results, the managers can conclude an appropriate fab scale in giga-fab, which will help to reduce the cycle time of products and increase the total throughput of giga-fab. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Along with higher vocational colleges and their internal units attaching great importance to the network publicity work continually to enhance, the number of various types of websites is in the rapid growth, meanwhile the website structures become increasingly complex and these websites are asked to provide more diversified services. The traditional model of website construction has been unable to meet the growing demand for construction and management of websites. SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) as a new software mode can provide convenient, fast and low-cost way to build network publicity support platform for higher vocational colleges. In this paper, we first introduce the definition and characteristics of SaaS, summarize the advantages of SaaS-based network publicity support platform, and then discuss the key technology for SaaS-based network publicity support platform related to the frame structure, system functionality and deployment. Finally, we introduce the application effect and the prospect of the platform. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Traditional cost control methods include cost estimation, planning, accounting, and repetitive control. However, they are not able to desirably solve large-quantity, time-dependent, and other non-mathematic issues related to cost control. This paper studied cost control by means of fuzzy control technology: establishing the cost fuzzy control system, fuzzy reasoning, and fuzzy control process (rule). By case analysis, it is found that the fuzzy control system of cost control can output control measures based on different input information, that it can accordingly choose and process adequate schemes of management, and that applications of exact mathematical models concerned are not necessary. This method is simple to be applied. Its application is efficient for scientific and computerized management of cost control. It can also be used to improve the level of project cost control. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The core problem of university informatization construction lies in the highly sharing of information resources. Thus it is very important to construct a unified user platform realizing this sharing. Through analyzing the current situation of campus website construction in universities, we propose a university website construction mode based on website group ideas from website construction, business management, content management and release to elaborate the mode in detail. Then, as Tsinghua University an example, we give system design of university website group including system architecture, system structure and functions. Finally, we introduce the application effect and prospects of the system. The analysis shows that the website group mode will gradually become the preferred choice on application mode of university website construction. This mode is facilitated to construct an integrated and coordinated, safe, reliable, stable, novel forms of network propaganda platform, enhance information sharing and enrich the propaganda content. And it will play a crucial role in establishing a good image of Tsinghua University. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

It changes the time duration of lights depending on waiting vehicles behind green and red lights at crossroad. The simulation has also been supported with real time graphical visualization. According to inferences from adaptive environment, TSK and Mamdani models have also been implemented to give baselines for verification.

abstract={More and more intelligent transportation technologies are applied to license plate detection and recognition that can greatly reduce the burden of traffic management. However, character segmentation of license plate is an indispensable step of license plate recognition. Traditional character segmentation algorithms of license plate mainly use the space between characters of license plate to segment characters, but the license plate cannot be recognized if there are degraded characters or license plate inclination. In this paper, an improved character segmentation algorithm of license plate is proposed. In the improved algorithm, firstly, the noise of precise located license plate is eliminated and then the license plate inclination is tested. When there is license plate inclination, we calculate the inclination angle and use rotation to correct the inclination. So, the problem of license plate inclination is solved in character segmentation. Lastly, the results show that the improved algorithm has better effect than the traditional algorithms and it lays a good foundation for the next research of license plate recognition. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To meet the demand of the higher precision ratio and recall ratio of service search, a method of Web service discovery is proposed based on ontology evolution and Web service migration. According to the developed cloud service platform and the existed service repository and domain ontology list, a service migration process is proposed which migrate to the cloud platform and implement unified management for Web service. This process effectively achieves that Web services migrate in and out of the cloud platform. In order to realize the self-evolution of domain ontology, an ontology alignment mechanism is designed to automatic extend and replace of ontology concept. This mechanism achieves the integration of different keywords with the same meaning and ensures the consistency of ontology concept. In this paper, the method not only enables efficient service discovery and dynamic service management, but also can achieve high concurrency support of services and supply or billing on demand. The experiments show that the proposed method solves the search problem of low efficiency based on keyword, and it effectively improves the precision ratio and recall ratio of service discovery. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The traditional expert system has shortcomings of poor self-learning ability, so the improved expert system is used to perform diagnosis of diseases and insects of fruit tree. Firstly the ontology is used to collect related symptoms of diseases and insects of fruit trees, the expert system and neural network are combined to build the prediction model of diseases and insects of fruit tree, then the conclusions of the diagnostic process are regarded as the input neurons and output neurons of neural networks, and are diagnosed by expert, so the prediction models of disease diagnosis of fruit trees are made. The models can implement the function of expert diagnosis and prediction, and provide technical support and management decision for the growth management of fruit tree, greatly improving the diagnosis efficiency of diseases and insects of fruit tree. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this paper, the framework and subsystem detailed design of LSSIMS (Large Sport Stadium Information Management System) is proposed on the basis of main function-demand analysis. After the main function demand is analyzed under 6 iterative stages, the overall framework design of the system is proposed on the basis of the principles of frame design. Then the LSSIMS is divided into the subsystems including the gateway websites, ticketing business subsystem, fitness management subsystem, online interactive subsystems, commercial operation subsystem and advertisement management subsystem. Finally the subsystems are designed individually by adopting the middleware technology and the thought of multi-level, loosely coupled and open design. Through the later stages of detailed design and full system development, it is showed that based on the framework design the LSSIMS provides managers with detailed statistical analysis, decision support and standardization interfaces, which can make good social benefits. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Due to the special requirement for broadcasting station security, we have undergone a second development of Serv-U FTP server, which has outstandingly high safety. At the same time, we can make interactive permission among broadcasting station user system.

abstract={In recent years, people pay more and more attention to coal production safety. In order to enhance the security of underground work, optimize the coal mine management, and improve the personnel location accuracy, a newly arisen technique based on ZigBee with the low power, low cost and low complexity, which is suitable for being used to implement personnel position in underground coal mine, is built after comparing with several kinds of major wireless technology. In this paper, we present a new algorithm of underground personnel position based on this new technology. The algorithm uses Gaussian filtering algorithm and Bayesian statistics theory. The algorithm has been tested and the result has been analyzed.

abstract={Production logistics is an element of the logistics system. This article presents its basic tasks and the scope of support for information technologists. The advance in the development of IT systems gives a new form to production enterprises supporting professional management of all logistics processes. Thanks to modern IT technology, production enterprises have the possibility of transformation, which enables them to carry out a new range of activities. The Author highlights in the paper the revolutionary role of integrated IT systems using the examples of selected systems, whose efficient implementation enables covering the operational needs of production enterprises. Although in the case of logistics, information has always constituted the basis for management, it is now when, thanks to the suitable technology, it has become the basis for competitive logistic strategies. Information, apart from workforce, capital, materials, is one of the basic resources of an enterprise, while IT systems have significantly extended the opportunity to make use of information which serves not only building reports or lists, but also covering operational needs of an enterprise. Thanks to those systems certain pieces of information can be used repeatedly without paying attention to their relevance. Proper implementation and use of integrated IT systems currently constitutes the basis for business management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The classical regression systems modeling methods only consider the single scene, which has the weakness: partial information missing may weaken the generalization abilities of the regression systems constructed based on this dataset. A regression system with the Knowledge transfer learning abilities, i.e. Knowledge Based e{open} - Support Vector Regression (KB-e{open} -SVR for brevity) is proposed based on ε -support vector regression. KB-e{open} -SVR can use the current data information sufficiently, and learn from the existing useful historical knowledge effectively, so that remedy the information lack in the current scene. Reinforced current model is obtained through control the similarity between current model and history model in the object function and current model can benefit from history scene when information is missing or insufficient. Experiments show that KB- ε -SVR has the better performance and adaptability than the traditional support vector regression methods in scenarios with insufficient data. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rapid development of high-speed railway, the equipment life-cycle management data are generated in large scales which run through the period of production, operation, maintenance, falling into a notion of "Big Data". There is broad recognition of value of data and information obtained through analyzing it. The exponential growth in the amount of railway-related data means that revolutionary measures are needed for data management, analysis and accessibility. At present, the promise of data-driven decision-making is now being recognized broadly. How to store the big data efficiently, reliably and cheaply are important research topics. This paper proposes a framework of data management of high-speed railway equipment, where cloud computing provides a feasible technical solution combined with MapReduce programming model based on Hadoop platform. These models are capable of considering the characteristics of data and processing demand in management of High-speed railway equipment. Finally, we summarize the challenges and opportunities with Big Data for application of China railway and point out there is more than enough that we can work on. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The low water and nitrogen utilization rates and environmental pollution as a result of the excessive irrigation and fertilization had been paid more and more attention. Adopting the simulation model based on physiological processes to study the optimization method and control technology of agricultural production and management is important to water-saving, rational fertilization and healthy environment. The maize (Zea mays L) is taken as material to explore the integration method of crop simulation with wireless sensing data. First the time scale and temporal scale of wireless sensing data will be unified with simulation step of crop model when the parameters are used as model inputs. Then the relationship between nitrogen balance and soil moisture will be analyze to construct maize production and management monitoring and control system based on wireless sensing data. The system can not only simulate the real-time and dynamic maize growth and development, but also provide the irrigation and fertilization schedule to distribute the annual natural resources depend on the user's production goal. The expected forecast results will offer theoretical basis and technological support for intelligent control, water and fertilizer utilization, and management of agricultural production departments. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Geological data with phyletic and various, huge and complex data format, the analysis of geological data processing is mainly divided into three parts: Mines forecast, mine evaluation and mine positioning. Traditional geological data analysis model is limited by limited storage space and computational efficiency, and cannot meet the needs of a large number of geological data fast operations. "Big data technology" provides the ideal solution to the vast amounts of geological data management, information extraction, and comprehensive analysis. For mass storage capacity and high-speed computing power that the "big data technology" need, we built an intelligence systems applied to the analysis of geological data based on MapReduce and GPU double parallel processing cloud computing model. For a large number of geological data, using hadoop cluster system to solve the problem of large amounts of data storage, and designing efficient parallel processing method based on GPU (Graphics Processing Units: calculation of Graphics Processing unit), the method was applied to MapReduce framework, finally completing MapReduce and GPU double parallel processing cloud computing model to improve the operation speed of the system. Through theoretical modeling and experimental verification, indicating that the system can meet the analysis of geological data operation precision, the operation data amount and the operation speed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The purpose of this article is to empirically examine the influence of customer personality characteristics (need for social affiliation, customer relationship proneness) on relationship outcomes (customer trust, satisfaction, and loyalty). Online responses from service companies were gathered to assess the influence using Structural Equation Models (SEM). Results indicate that need for social affiliation is a strong determinant of customer relationship proneness and trust. Consumer relationship proneness has directly positive impact on trust and satisfaction. The results confirm the trust-satisfaction-loyalty paradigm in service context. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this paper, a smart green energy management system based on DMX512 protocol that is established by United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT) is proposed. The end user can monitor and control the LED lamps and electric powers according to the information received from the sensors by means of the channels of DMX512. In addition, the different color lights including red, green, and blue lights can be achieved by means of the color-mixing methods of red, green, and blue LEDs based on photometry theory. As a matter of fact, there have been attracted much attention on the mobile devices in recent years. In the study, a mobile device with an Android platform is used to control the electric power and LED lamps according to the information received from the ZigBee module immediately. However, the smart green energy management system based on DMX512 protocol has some merits, such as in real-time control, easy operation, low cost, etc. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={An innovative but low-cost mobile phone-based mechanism for e-payment, e-ticketing, and e-identity documents was proposed in an earlier article by Chan [1], who also discussed the business and technical rationales behind the innovation. Albeit it is still yet to see to what extent the mechanism will benefit the real world, it is no doubt an example of a mechanism developed with very minimal funding. In fact, the highest cost was related to its patent applications. Therefore, its development is a typical illustration of inexpensive innovation of ideas as opposed to costly experimentation and instrumentation. Specifically, this innovation, be it substantial or not, was initiated by and founded on multiple-perspective thinking, which had been popularized in educational systems and communities worldwide in recent years despite such thinking's somewhat arcane philosophical origin. Being a qualitative, applied, industrial article instead of a piece of theoretical work, this article further elucidates the multiple-perspective model underlying the aforementioned innovation in order to exemplify the application of multiple-perspective thinking to innovation management in general. The model explores multiple perspectives as subsumed under the categories of objectives, time, locations, roles, and incidents. Further refining these categories by translating them into individual requirements of the mechanism, it ends up with what it is today. This case study underscores how multiple-perspective thinking can be leveraged as an integral and instrumental part of innovation management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={A reservoir model is developed to characterize the functioning of the karst aquifer of the Jinci Spring. It is based on the relationship of the groundwater storage deficit and the groundwater level. The relationship is derived from the monitoring data of the aquifer. The model is verified with the monitoring data (1981-2006) and is used to predict the recovery of the Jinci Spring flow and the groundwater level in the aquifer under three exploitation schemes with the future rainfall data provided by the National Climate Center (NCC). The results show that the Jinci Spring will flow out again before 2050 under Scheme I and II. The Xuan Spring will flow out earlier than the Jinci Spring. However, both of the two springs cannot spout under Scheme III. The model takes account of the artificial recharge, pumping and coal mine drainage, and can simulate the spring discharge, karst groundwater level and the storage deficit accurately at an annual time scale. The model is suitable for macroscopic groundwater management. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The results indicate that land use conflicts are increasing seriously in rural-urban transformation, which has become the obstacle to sustainable land-use and healthy urbanization development. Under the state council, local governments and all enterprises, rural collective economic organizations, and peasants are the major stakeholders. Different interests of various stakeholders are the root of these conflicts. Land use conflicts can be dissolved through improving rural land property rights institution and land requisition system, and establishing coordination mechanism of interests based on the principle of interests balance in Rural-urban transformation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Crop genetic diversity is crucial for the environment, for feeding humanity and for sustainable agriculture development, which is providing genetic barriers against different biotic and abiotic stresses; however, it is being lost at an alarming rate. Fortunately, more and more people are conscious of the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources goes far beyond avoiding the extinction of species, and the objective must be to conserve and use as much diversity as possible within each species. There is now a need for an integrated strategy for the conservation and management of crop genetic diversity and the organization of related information at several levels, for instance, at the highest level, it is necessary for entire agro-ecosystem, and also applies to the gene pools of individual crops at the interspecies level as well as at the intervarietal levels. This paper assesses the estimates methods on different genetic diversity in crop, introduces the status of crop genetic diversity, and prospects the significant conservation of crop genetic diversity for sustainable agriculture in the future. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Because of the large-scale emission of nitrous oxides (NOx) in recent years, acid rain is still one of the major air pollution problems in China, although SO2 has been well controlled. And then, the goals for the total emission control of NOx begin to move forward in the 12th five-year plan, which requires a 10% cut in national NOx emissions by 2015, relative to the 2010 level, and NOx emission reduction of coal-fired power plants are still put in a strategic position. Accordingly, it's of great significance to carry out flue gas denitrification work around the power industry with purposes and plans. In this study, a mixed 0-1 integer nonlinear flue gas denitrification programming model for power system is developed for the first time, which can be used for planning the initial time put into operation of SCR facilities in a region and optimize the allocation of NOx emission reduction balance, which is significant for generation expansion planning. The model is applied to the power system in Heilongjiang province and the results indicate that the proposed model not only can meet the requirement of flue gas denitrification management, but also can help the coal-fired power plants clear the economic impact of NOx emission reduction on self-development. This study can provide reference for the decision support of NOx emission reduction and generation expansion in power industry. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Due to the poor openness between grid models at different levels in existing dispatching centers, there's lack of unified device naming conventions, data exchange standards and interface specifications, making it difficult to easily implement the exchange and sharing of network model parameters and data.

Taking advantage of "model cloud" storage and service technology, unified maintenance and management technology, model subscribing and extracting technology as well as its releasing methods and standardized access technology, the system can construct a "cloud service" unified in the whole grid, covering all dispatch services with the integration of the grid model information, therefore realizing the unified management, maintenance, generation, release and subscriptions. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

A questionnaire survey was conducted among 300 students who came from Northeastern University and Shenyang Jianzhu University during the period from October,2011 to May, 2012.The results of the questionnaire survey show that the students' concerns are not only related to their general risk perception and attitudes to nuclear energy, but also strongly related to the comparison of gender differences of risk perception and attitude on nuclear energy safety between study majors. Therefore, the results of this study provide useful information for risk management and implications of future nuclear energy policy for Chinese governments. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel reconfiguration strategy for active distribution network considering maximum power supply capability (PSC) is proposed. Firstly, a PSC index (PSCI) is proposed to evaluate the real-time security level of distribution network. Then, a novel reconfiguration strategy is developed for enhancing the PSCI of distribution network when the PSCI is lower than a pre-defined warning value. The reconfiguration strategy can be integrated to distribution management system (DMS) as a preventive control method to prevent outages of customers, which can significantly increase the reliability of distribution network. Case studies are carried out by using a typical 33-bus distribution network, and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed reconfiguration strategy, which has a good engineering application prospect. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={To analyze the willingness to cooperate of farmers to participate in water management, we base on game theory and first carry on single static game analysis of willingness to cooperate for farmers to participate in water management, and find that farmers are into a Prisoners' Dilemma in a single game, individual rationality comes into conflict with collective rationality, at this time farmers have a tendency to "free riders", so it is difficult to achieve cooperation between the farmers. Then trying to break the prisoners' dilemma, we carry on the farmers' repeated dynamic game, the analysis is carried on in the context of incomplete information and limited rationality, we carry on game evolution analysis for willingness to cooperate for farmers to participate in water management. In order to guarantee the rationality of the study, we conduct a survey of willingness to cooperate of farmers to participate in water management in province of Zhejiang and finally confirm that the study is reasonable. And through the analysis of the full text, we conclude six important conclusions. © (2013)Trans Tech Publications,Switzerland.},

abstract={Determining harmonic contribution quantitatively at the point of common coupling is an important task for power quality management. Outliers and influential points could have strong influences on regressors. This paper puts forward a method named 'reweighted complex least squares' to eliminate or reduce the influences to ensure the robustness of the regression. The method can improve precision of the equivalent harmonic impedance and it can get a more reasonable result in harmonic contribution determination than previous methods. A case study based on the IEEE 14-bus test system was conducted, which shows the validity of the proposed method. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In order to provide reserve power supply, consumption dispatch can be integrated into the conventional generation dispatch model. This serves as a feasible approach in connecting intermittent power sources such as hydropower into the power grid. An integrated generation-consumption dispatch model with hydropower is presented considering the consumption dispatch mode, such as consumption stimulation, interruptible load management, and price response, etc. Practical case studies show that price-responsive loads and interruptible loads tend to exert great influence on the load distribution which lead to a reallocation of generation among thermal generation units, run-of-river and storage hydropower generation units, which favours the total reservoir storage of the system so that the overall system operational economy can be improved. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Under the influence of the global climate change and the increasingly intensified major meteorological disasters in recent years, aquaculture has a stronger demand for meteorological information service. Various meteorological disasters (typhoon, storm, flood, low temperature, etc.) will change the environment of water aquaculture and cause great economic losses to aquaculture. With aquaculture in Zhanjiang of China as the research subject, a meteorological information system has been designed to serve aquaculture. The B/S-based three-layer structure was chosen based on the MS.NET development platform. SQLServer2005 was chosen as the database server and SuperMap IS.NET as the map server. By the use of GIS spatial analysis and thematic map, this system developed the functions of disastrous weather forecast, warning and management and realizes the statistics and analysis of different meteorological disasters. The system provides the users with the personalized suggestions on disaster prevention and mitigation. At present, this system has been put into use. The results show that it can provide the convenient and effective meteorological information service for the users. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

In this paper, the reserve resources of VPP are classified into non-renewable distributed generation (NRDG), energy storage device (ESD), interruptible load (IL) and reserve bought from the market (RBFM). Their complementary properties should be utilized to improve the economy of reserve allocation. An optimal coordination model for risk management of NRDG configuration of VPP reserve allocation is proposed.

abstract={The dynamic change and pattern of export derived energy consumption during 2002- 2010 in China was calculated and analyzed. The proportion of export derived energy consumption to total energy consumption of China showed a converted "V" pattern. The direct energy consumption from metallurgical and chemical industries accounts for a large proportion in the total direct energy consumption of china's export. Although the proportion of direct energy consumption from equipment industry is relatively small, its proportion of embodied energy consumption is high due to its long industry chain and high input of energy-intensive intermediate. In order to reduce the direct and embodied energy consumption from the export of equipment industry, modern technologies and effective management methods should be adopted to upgrade and enhance the total industry. Additionally, measures should be taken to reduce the energy consumption of its related up-stream's industries such as metallurgy and power industry. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Terrestrial vegetation and soils in the terrestrial biosphere play an active role in shaping the environmental systems of the Earth. An improved understanding of changes in carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems is very important for assessing the impacts of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change on the terrestrial biosphere. Accurately predicting terrestrial carbon (C) storage requires understanding the stock and storage potential of C, because it helps us understand how ecosystems would respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances under different management strategies. Grasslands are important for global carbon balance both for their large area and significant sink or source capacities, depending on the factors of climatic and land-use. Land-use change is often associated with changes in land cover and carbon (C) stocks. Land-use and land cover strongly influence carbon (C) storage and distribution within the grassland ecosystems. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={An Eco-industrial Park (EIP) is an industrial park developed according to the theory of industrial ecology, which can significantly reduce industrial pollution and improve regional or local sustainability. On the account of the requirements on energy and material flows connection, the construction and development of EIPs are contingent for effective environmental plannings. China initiated the construction of EIPs during foundation of the previous economic and technological development or high-tech districts in 2001, by classifying EIPs into 3 categories: Integrated Eco-Industrial Park, Sector Eco-Industrial Park and Venous Industry based on Eco-Industrial Park. In each category, EIP contributes significantly to the regional and local economy as well as regional and sustainable development. The environmental planning for EIP is guided by three independent standards and by the HJT 409-2007 guides for the establishment of EIP Planning, which makes regulations on the principles, methods, contents and detailed requirements of the EIP planning. The purpose of this study is to identify the effectiveness of EIP planning in China. This article reviews the theory and practice of EIPs in China and summarizes China's environmental planning (EP) system. A case of EIP is presented for qualitative analysis and for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the EIP planning. The results of the evaluation on both the achievements and the processes of planning's goals, from the perspective of environmental carrying capacity (ECC), reveal the challenges of EIP planning in China. Then recommendations are provided on how to improve China's EP system for EIP to achieve the desired results. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={An effective management of water supply is critically significant to a country's water utilities, and accurate prediction of water supply and demand is of key importance for water supply management. The objectives of this paper are to use Grey System Model (GSM) and Linear Regression Model to forecast the water demand and water supply respectively in China 2025, and then propose a new Optimal Allocation Model (OAM) to generate solution so that analysts and decision makers can gain insight and understanding. The two predictive models take into account four major factors including domestic development, agriculture, industries and eco-environment, calculating a deficit between water demand and water supply in China 2025. Then the OAM, which considers desalinization, irrigation saving and urban recycling, provides a feasible solution to fill the gap and an effectual management of water supply. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The energy yield of PV system with different material, declination angle and land covering ratio are presented. Comparisons are made between two Chinese cities, Beijing and Nanjing. Shading effects are also investigated for the PV system's energy yield calculation. It shows that by neglecting the losses due to weather and the temperature effects, for the location with higher latitude (such as Beijing) the PV system installed with double junction solar cells (micromorph silicon) is predicted to have lower Performance Ratio than that with mono-crystalline silicon and multi-crystalline silicon. An optimum row spacing of a PV system should be considered for limited occupation area. The criteria above are important for large scale PV system design and its efficiency maximization. The simulation is useful to predict the power fluctuation delivered by PV system due to the spectral, seasonal variation and geometry difference. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This study examined the impact of corporate governance on environmental information disclosure in the China context. Our data was based on Shanghai A-share companies for the period 2008 to 2011. We examined the effect of corporate governance from different aspects. We find that Outstanding shares rate, State-holding ratio, and CEO/Chairman duality negatively affect environmental disclosure index (EDI) significantly; Proportion of independent directors, supervisory board and board sizes positively affect EDI significantly. Our results indicate that in China, corporate governance does influence the extent of environmental information disclosure significantly. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Landscape architecture has become one of the most important parts of contemporary living environment due to its extensive value in the field of aesthetics and ecology, society and culture. However, because of the lack of effective theoretical guidance of cost control, contemporary landscape consumes a lot of resources and environmental costs during the construction and maintenance, which is against the original intention of constructing good ecological environment. Low-cost landscape architecture, with the idea of low intervention, low consumption, low conservation and low emission, is trying to research on controlling the landscape architecture construction interference to the environment and reducing landscape cost of construction and conservation from material selection and labor management to promote the long-term development of landscape architecture effectively. Landscape architecture as a effective way of improving the environment and enhancing the ecological benefit,is gradually getting people's attention. However, during the whole process of Landscape construction and maintenance, investors input the high-cost of materials and manpower costs, but often do not equal to get the desired ecological, functional, aesthetic and social value. Landscape architects have the responsibility to guide the correct landscape values, explore methods which can make larger the landscape value with the less resource consumption and environmental impact. Among these, to implement low-cost landscape architecture is a kind of effective method. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the era of the new economy, research on freight transport and logistics in urban areas can not ignore the impact of the internet on society. From the point of view of e-commerce, the Web is joined in the daily life of the Italians not only for the growing opportunities to shop at better conditions than the other channels, but for the enormous possibilities that the Internet provides for those who has time, desire and interest to search the site data and useful information to make more effective shopping for a product or a service. The effects of these changes on the transport demand are manifold: on the one hand, the use of virtual activities replaces a series of physical movements, on the other hand the individual who carries out these activities virtually could use the time saved to perform other tasks or perform another type of movement. No less important are the impact of e-commerce on the distribution, since the online purchasing determine, in a specific area, a number of points to be served with high variability and, therefore, quite different from the default items identified by the traditional commercial structure of that area. In the present work some studies on the effects of e-economy and e-commerce on passenger transport and freight transport are detailed and the processes of acquisition of the database for the development of a behavioral model for simulating consumers' choices about e-shopping and shopping in trade are defined. The model allow to predict the effects of new technologies on consumers habits and act on demand, focusing on services that may mark the success of innovative approaches to the management of urban transport. The specifications, calibration and validation of models to choose between e-commerce and physical commerce are presented. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the dozen years after our country enters the new century, the industrial development has made considerable progress. Under such pace of advancement, it is the development and utilization of energy that plays a key role. Among these great progresses, the development momentum of the coal industry has been far beyond people's previous expectation. The development and utilization of coal resources has not only been widely used in China, but also been an important research subject in some advanced countries in the world. The level of current coal data mining has seriously hampered the development of coal mining enterprises. As a kind of new revolutionary technology, data mining technique is mainly based on the power management system. Such technique can handle all the tasks and fully play the advantage of digital characterization. In this paper, we will make a related study of the hot topic on coal mining power management system based on the data mining technique. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the large-scale construction of smart grid, smart grid terminals widely using wireless access technology to communicate to the power systems. For ensuring the communication security, pair-wise key pre-distribution scheme is widely used, however, which introduces the complexity of key management, and insufficient security problems. According to the smart grid terminals wireless communication features, proposes an intelligent grid wireless terminal online key management scheme, which is based on the t rank binary symmetric polynomial and fully homomorphic encryption algorithm. This scheme make the communication key could be established with a few parameters between the communicating parties, which reduces the complexity of key predistribution and the amount of calculation. Moreover, the whole process of the key generation is encrypted by fully homomorphic encryption algorithm, effectively enhances the security of the scheme. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},
