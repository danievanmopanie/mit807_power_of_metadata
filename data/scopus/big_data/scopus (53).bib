abstract={The Internet of Things has revolutionized the way we can think about sales and customer relationship management strategies. In this context, a view of the world where technology is embedded in practically all objects and physical spaces will be an expectable reality. This reality opens up unprecedented opportunities with regard to the levels of customization in the sales process, whether in virtual spaces or in physical spaces. However, IoT also poses enormous challenges in the field of security and in particular in the field of user privacy. In this context, this article, after analyzing some of the main challenges for IoT in the privacy domain and what impact the IoT may have in the business domain and in particular in the subdomains of sales and advertising, presents a conceptual model to support customer empowerment while citizen with regard to the definition and management of privacy policies concerns a context that may go beyond the boundaries of citizenship and be applied in scenarios without borders, whenever there is the possibility of defining policies and legislation above Country. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The authors propose to study an innovative approach to talent management based on the need for change that organizations are facing due to a disruptive environment brought on by the fourth industrial revolution: the digital revolution. Its nature and impact on society, on management systems, and on business organizations are described as the stage where a significant change movement is happening to an extent and intensity never seen before. To deal with this, the authors elaborate on the need for increased agility and flexibility as determinant factors for the competitiveness of organizations and businesses. In that sense, a new approach to talent management is proposed based on an innovative concept of talent – which is democratic. By describing the key elements of this innovative concept, a new approach to human resource management is also described, arguing for the need of moving towards disruption in traditional policies, processes, and practices. Five interviewees approached during the Covid-19 pandemic, in late 2020, share their views herein on their talents and of digital disruption and opportunity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The evolution of technologies and the increase in the amount of information shared, have revolutionized the way we act and think, but also the way we create, share and store content. Given this reality, Content Management Systems (CMS) much contributed and continue to contribute and, for that matter, this study aims to analyze the acceptance of CMSs by professionals from municipalities belonging to the Comunidade Intermunicipal da Lezíria do Tejo (CIMLT), using a model adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), considered the most robust in identifying the determinants of technological acceptance. Therefore, a survey was conducted, in order to draw conclusions about the acceptance of CMSs by CIMLT professionals that use it in their daily work. Allowing to identify variables such as perception of usefulness, perception of ease of use and relevance to the performance of work, essential for the acceptance of CMSs in CIMLT, with training and experience being factors that enhance this acceptance. Therefore, it is crucial to promote and implement regular training actions. We conclude that the promotion of the use of technologies such as CMSs in the public sector is essential for the integration, efficiency and effectiveness of the services provided, but above all for the responsibility and transparency in the communities, by allowing a dynamic, safe, current and direct search and usability of information and content. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The organization’s strategy of a company is determinant in its performance. The need to develop methodologies to evaluate the performance of projects in organizations has a strong contribution to the development of maturity models. The lack of knowledge of these maturity models causes organizations to experience problems in the development and improvement of their project management processes. The main objective of this article is to adapt and apply a maturity model to assess the evolution of the maturity of project management practices in development teams in an academic environment. The Prado Project Management Maturity Model was applied to the project teams of the curricular subjects Development of Computer Applications of the second academic year and Information Systems and Technologies Project of the fourth academic year of the Integrated Masters in Engineering and Management of Information Systems course at the University of Minho. Through the application of the model, it was possible to compare the maturity between the two curricular units and to verify the effectiveness of the learning methods and strategies, and results in project management competencies throughout the course. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In recent years, the growing demand for animal products led to an increase of the number and size of animal farms across the world. Farmers are facing with a multitude of challenges in order to properly manage their business, as they have to consider increasingly complex factors within their decisions, such as: more diverse and larger numbers of animals to manage, more demanding production requirements, complex business models to choose from, environmental restrictions, etc. Thus, the transition from conventional agricultural practices to more technology-based approaches is mandatory. In this regard, the newest advancements in technology will enable the development of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). In this paper, we are showcasing a blockchain-based monitoring and management platform which plans to help farmers improve their activities, reduce costs, minimize the environmental footprint and manage their resources more efficiently. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The project management practice by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is an urgent demand and a clear concern of European countries for economic reasons in recent years. One major problem in traditional management practices is the focus on efficiency rather than innovation and control rather than empowerment. Several authors mention the existence of a “gap” between the theory and the actual use of project management by SMEs that increasingly require government support. This paper aims to analyze the economic scenario in the context of Portuguese and Danish SMEs that promotes innovation and project management practice through literature review and economic reports. The measures and initiatives adopted to minimize the factors that hinder the realization of businesses highlight the efforts of each country to encourage organizations to adapt to a dynamic and competitive context. The perspective is that the economic scenario presented points favorable aspects for SMEs and serve as parameters for future work and development of management practices appropriate to the size and maturity of SME organizations. Furthermore, the paper strengths the role of SMEs in innovation and the importance of using project management practices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The importance of analyzing data on public health, especially on notifications of disease cases, can play an important role in the overall improvement of the framework for combating epidemics. This type of study proved to be extremely influential during the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded rapid and specific actions for the management of different geographic regions. This work presents the design and results of a system that has made possible perform analysis of this nature even in contexts of scarcity of structured and even georeferenced data. It is hoped that the work will be an inspiration for new, more comprehensive initiatives, without implying that health professionals have an advanced knowledge about the techniques and technologies that form the basis of the platform, easily integrating with existing processes and adding value. The result was the generation of a structured and aggregated database of COVID-19 data in the city of Brasilia, Federal District, capital of Brazil. If the informs used to extract data previously provided only information about the disease situation, with the platform, they now provide a basis for complex epidemiological analyzes and even spreading animations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The evolution of technology in the last decade predicts a future where technology is disseminated in the environment in order to merge with the environment itself, being omnipresent. This world paradigm has been associated with the Internet of Things concept or, according to several authors, with the Internet of Everything concept. The potential massive dispersion of technology, which, with the progress of nanotechnology, will be increasingly miniaturized, combined with high-performance and universal communication networks, will revolutionize the concept of monitoring, resulting in profound changes in various sectors of activity and knowledge. In this context, this article presents a cloud-based Internet of Things architecture in order to respond to the growing needs of monitoring by the Civil Protection Public Organizations, who are responsible for monitoring several parameters and produce multiple information and reports in the context of the security of populations and territories. Finally, it is presented a prototype implemented according to the proposed architecture capable of monitoring monoliths dispersed in the territory, as a way of acting preventively, avoiding merely reactive actions after disaster situations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The music industry has faced a tremendous change ever since the emergence of streaming. People now had access to unlimited music to listen to and share with others, which is a great concept. As companies started to invest in the future of streaming, many platforms were created, one of them being Spotify. Standing amidst a crowd of competitors, Spotify managed to climb to the top and comfortably remain there over the years (listed on the NYSE and having 120 employees; IPO share price (3rd April 2018) = 169.9 US Dollars and share price of 319.77 US dollars on 4th December 2020). However, it was not easy. Being one of the top streaming platforms in the industry requires effort, investment, adaptation and innovation, and exceptional management. This study analyses in-depth the aforementioned aspects, as well as the company’s business models and its revenue, which combined, led Spotify to where it is today. A survey with 498 answers was performed regarding Spotify, and the results were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential (Chi-Square test) statistics. We thus conclude very confidently that there does seem to be an association (statistically significant at the 0.1% level) between age and the use of Spotify. Younger respondents (18–35 years) are more likely to use Spotify than older respondents (&amp;gt; 35 years). Overall, Spotify’s business model is one of the best in its field and is constantly evolving, which is what is to be expected of a company that seeks the top spot on the podium. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Bots built on management software platforms are a new tool to improve daily communication between users of the same application. Its use shows advantages thanks to the possibility of automating the process of communication, production and distribution of products in general, and even to follow live events or news information that is published through the respective modules of the management systems. Gradually, companies are adapting their strategies to the use of these tools and process automation. This research presents the results of a discussion group with forty-six professionals in the software developer, which aims to analyze the bot phenomenon in Ecuador. The initial results reveal that software development and the industry are in a stage of adoption of this technology, although the first success stories can already be seen. The discussion group was formed taking into account the experience in the area of software development and the practice in the implementation of bots. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This study aims to analyze the stimulating components for business development in Latin American SMEs (case: Colombia).For this purpose, the unit of analysis was the companies listed in the Legiscomex database (trade intelligence) as of December 31, 2019, which integrates the national databases of companies registered and validated by the National Tax and Customs Administration the Confederation of Chambers of Commerce of Colombia. For this exercise of the impact of the four components of business development, 100,000 iterations were defined (Monte Carlo method), which represents a large amount of random data on the information parameters collected and accumulated to estimate a probability distribution of the success that the companies would have in real life, having as input the specific information of financial management,knowledge management, innovation processes and marketing. The results reflect that business development is influenced by four components in the following proportion: Financial Management (30%), Knowledge Management (25%), Innovation Processes (25%) and Marketing (20%). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={During COVID-19 the world experienced an unprecedented educational crisis, where conventional systems based on presence were fractured by long periods of confinement. In order to face this situation, the benefits of the educational digital platforms were used. In this sense, this research aimed to analyze knowledge management strategies through the use of educational digital platforms during periods of social confinement in Mexico, Colombia and Peru. A survey composed of 22 items with a Likert scale was applied to 396 teachers in the period from 01/09/2020 to 15/11/2020. It was concluded that schools had difficulties in connecting to the Internet, lack of electronic devices, lack of information technology skills for the use of educational digital platforms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have become an emerging technology that is reshaping the industry 4.0. An exponential evolution with an enormous application in diverse areas such as aerospace engineering, healthcare, and smart farming. WSNs have also grown into a very hot area of interest. Therefore, several types of research have been conducted around the world interesting in energy efficiency, wireless communication, network lifetime, and scalability. Energy consumption is one of the most challenging areas in WSNs, with wireless propagation losses, limited power sources, and random sensor’s implementation, researchers during the last decade interested in developing new approaches serving for power consumption’s reduction and control. Clustering is one of several paradigms that are explored to manage power use and expand the network’s lifetime. In this paper, a multi-hop and dynamic k-medoids based algorithm for energy saving is proposed. The algorithm is using the elbow method for an optimized K parameter selection. The k-medoids clustering approach aims to reduce distances between cluster heads and relative cluster members at each round, for better communication’s management and an eventual optimization in the power dissipation during wireless transmission. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared to the results from Leach, Heed, and k-medoids. Extensive simulation runs shown an improvement of 30% compared to normal K-medoids in terms of first dead node and an improvement of 108% in terms of network lifetime. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Decision support systems (DSS) have a wide variety of applications in management decisions and optimization of engineering processes. Nowadays, the construction industry calls for state-of-the-art mechanisms to take control of the waste generated on construction sites. Executives need advanced systems and technologies to help them get instant information from construction sites and control the activities in a way that minimum waste is generated. This paper explains how real-time multi-agent DSS as robust information technology tools can be applied to help control the environmental risks posed by construction operations. DSS provides a platform in which courses of actions from several teams are coordinated and corresponding massive data from the construction site are analyzed and compiled to support judgments. A qualitative study was conducted to identify how to design such a system using both machine and human agents. The results of this study constitute a basis for the detailed design of a waste control DSS that can be developed by programming experts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the field of management of manufacturing resources, there are a number of solutions to make it easier for the end user to work with equipment. Often the user does not gain an overview of the relevance of the structure of the assets in relation to the current process. So although a number of integration solutions exist, plants are structured according to manufacturing needs, leaving out the human factor. This paper examines the human factor as an integral part of the planning of manufacturing resources and proposes a management of plants that reflects the needs of the user, breaks down collaboration barriers and protects the user from technical details. Driven by ideas from model-driven architecture we propose a solution in form of an open software platform that addresses these problems. The platform offers low code technologies to provide domain-specific administration shells, which are a more user-focused representation of machines and processes within factories. To test the concepts proposed here, an experiment was conducted on the platform. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The spread of IoT and wearable devices is bringing out gesture interfaces as a solution for a more natural and immediate human-machine interaction. The “Seamless” project is an industrial research and development experience, aimed to build a virtual environment where data collected by IoT sensors can be navigated through a gesture interface and virtual reality tools. This paper presents the portion of the project concerning gesture analysis, focused on the problem of automatically understanding a set of hand gestures, in order to give commands through a wearable control device. The tackled issue is to build a real time gesture recognition system based on inertial data that can easily adapt to different users and to an extensible set of gestures. This gesture data variability is addressed by means of a supervised Machine Learning approach that allows adapting the system response to different gestures and to various ways of performing them by different people. A context-aware adapter allows interfacing the gesture recognition system to various applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Blockchain is the growing technical technology that has attracted interest from around the world. This technology makes the transfer of money possible and makes transactions electronically easier and safer than the conventional payment system. It's a typical awareness that Blockchain can make financial data security easier. Technology, however, also poses specific difficulties in fulfilling some financial data protection needs. Therefore, this paper recommends a framework founded on Blockchain to protect and secure financial data transfer on mobile. A multi-level authentication was used to secure the mobile banking and a two-factor authentication protocol to generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) for secure funds transfer. The attained outcomes point to the sovereignty of the projected Framework when compared with existing work. The proposed system addresses the requirements of building a secure application for mobile banking because of the increased security and privacy of clients on mobile banking applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to study the development and influence of digitalization in the marketing processes and supply chain management and how an integration of both can be a useful tool in marketing decision making. Many research has been conducted on supply chain management and marketing; however, little attention has been drawn to the combination of these two functions and the potential impacts of information technology in decision making and value-creation. Data generated from Internet of things, cloud computing, big data analytics and customer profiling have created new opportunities for businesses to supplement their business intelligence for better understanding customer demand and bargaining power of suppliers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Big data analytics has recently emerged as an important research area due to the advent of user-generated content platforms. In recent years, we have witnessed an exponential increase in data production all over the world. This phenomenon is known as big data. Social media platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube represent the most popular source of big data. Big data coming from social networking sites can be immensely useful for all companies by providing valuable insights on consumer preferences and changing trends. This information presents enormous opportunities for companies that have implemented Big Data management solutions. For this reason, how to store, manage, and transform social media posts into knowledge for decision-makers becomes an important research problem. On the other hand, the massive amount of data generated by users using social media platforms has led to the emergence and development of new technologies and techniques of data management. Data Lake is one of the latest technologies that was introduced to address this challenge in the last period. In this paper, we provide a NoSQL data lake design approach. More precisely, we start by introducing the main concepts of data lake. We also discuss the advantages of data lakes and their impact on big data analytics. Then, we describe some of the recent literature reviews on data lake design approaches. Finally, we provide a NoSQL Data lake using MongoDB that allows storing big data collected from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The rapid development of the national economy is accompanied by a significant improvement in people’s living standards, and people have a stronger demand for travel, and the tourism industry is showing a trend of vigorous development. In order to obtain intuitive and effective travel information, this paper uses data mining technology to mine data in social media platforms and conduct travel data analysis. This article applies data mining to social media and tourism management data analysis systems. First, we need to clearly understand the problems that need to be solved. Only in this way can we make effective choices based on the problems, and then build the database. After the database is constructed, the data, if there are errors in the calculation and analysis, then appropriate adjustments need to be made to meet the actual data mining and analysis. The research results show that the tourism data mining model based on social media proposed in this paper has an average increase of 4.30%, 4.81% and 7.01% on the ML-1m, ML-10m and AIV datasets compared with CTR, CDL, ConvMF and DMF. You can see the advantages of data mining models that integrate contextual information. On the dense MovieLens dataset, the DMF model has a small difference compared to the ConvMF model due to the use of a multi-layer perceptron network, but compared to shallow models such as CTR, all of them have been greatly improved, which also illustrates the advantage of the multi-layer neural network model to obtain the characteristics of the score data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the information age, computer network and modern information technology have gradually entered various industries, bringing new formats and trends to the development of various industries. Grid economy is a new economic form based on computer network and with modern information technology as its core. It includes not only the information technology industry, but also the high-tech industry based on computer technology and the traditional industrial departments with high-tech. It can be said that in the information age, grid economy has become a high-level economic development form, and its dependence on information technology is also restricted by information technology. How to do well in the innovation and development of grid economy under big data technology has become an urgent task. Resource management is a prerequisite for the development of grid economy and traditional economy in the new era, which can meet the needs of grid economy and traditional economy by optimizing the allocation of human resources, infrastructure, working environment, financial resources, suppliers and partners, as well as knowledge information and technical resources. Based on this social development background, the exploration of resource management and grid economy research progress under big data analysis technology can bring new opportunities for the next stage of grid economic development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Smart environments such as smart homes are a collection of IoT devices, sensors, artificial intelligence and remote control systems. These technologies come with many possible benefits, such as improved energy-efficiency, easier maintenance and increased living comfort. On the other hand, ubiquitous use of these technologies raise cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Understanding the vulnerabilities, attack vectors and potential exploits of these systems is crucial for enabling precise and effective countermeasures. In this study, we investigate the potential of man-in-the-browser attacks for targeting the remote control systems of smart homes. We implement a malicious browser extension to the Chrome web browser that can alter the user input in a smart home management console. We empirically demonstrate that these browser extensions can manipulate IoT devices in a smart home. We discuss countermeasures for securing the remote control systems of smart homes against man-in-the-browser attacks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Data mining is extracted from a large number of incomplete, noise, broadcast and random data hidden in it. There are many terms similar to knowledge discovery in database, data analysis, data merging and decision support. Like mining, people use raw data as a source of knowledge. The original data can be used as relational or semi-structured database data structure in the form of text, image, image or impurity data published on the Internet. The method of discovering knowledge can be mathematical or non mathematical, inferential or inductive. The discovered knowledge can be used in information management, request optimization, decision support, process control, and data maintenance and management. In this paper, decision tree algorithm and acupuncture prescription model are used to carry out a series of research. Data mining is a wide range of technical category summary, which has intelligent, mathematical statistics, database, parallel computing and decision tree algorithm in the field of engineering and technical personnel. The new information processing technology data mining technology is good at extracting, integrating and inferring the knowledge in text data from large data. This technology has obvious advantages for needle data processing. The analysis of complex meridians, meridian blood, diseases, medical records and other data related to acupuncture is suitable to show the scientific significance of acupuncture theory. This paper is based on the compatibility of data mining technology in acupuncture and moxibustion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={China National Committee for Terms in Sciences and Technologies (CNCTST) is a top management agency in China. It was established in 1985, aiming to introduce new terminology, endorse changes of borrowed terminology, alter the standards of terminology, explain unfamiliar terminology, and adopt practice to make terminology more accurate. CNCTST tries to standardize terminology practices in the country. Under the management of CNCTST, a considerable number of terminology databases have been constructed to serve the academic research and practical translation. Furthermore, CNCTST officially launched the first phase of DISE (data intelligent search engine) platform named TERMONLINE on June 15, 2016, and launched the revised second phase of TERMONLINE on September 17, 2020. This article will discuss both different periods of CNCTST and its successful management in Chinese terminology research and practices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Smart grid based systems are part of modernized critical infrastructures that countries use to operate in various critical sectors ranging from electricity services, nuclear stations, transportation systems, hospital services, waste management, water services, etc. The modern smart grid based systems comprises of operational technology (OT) components and the information technology (IT) components and the convergence of both has introduced new security challenges for the operations of the systems in terms of its safety, reliability, efficiency and stability. The security perimeter is completely redrawn with the OT and IT convergence. The need of the hour is the new approaches towards the security that are innovative and will ensure the security of critical infrastructures. The traditional approach of perimeter-based security defense is obsolete with the convergence of OT and IT. The Zero Trust model for user access and identity is based on concept of “Never Trust but Always Verify” that enable organizations to secure the critical infrastructures by ensuring only trustworthy and validated components are allowed into the network. The perimeter-centric security architecture is replaced by Zero Trust model to ensure and enable security and access decisions for devices, identity and user context to be enforced dynamically. It also ensures that only authorized and authenticated users and devices can have access to the network, systems, applications and data. In this paper we are proposing Zero Trust User Access & Identity Security model that can be implemented in smart grid based SCADA systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things technology and the popularization of its application, the technology is gradually applied to the agricultural field. The application of the Internet of Things technology to agricultural management has effectively promoted the rapid development of the agricultural industry. Transforming traditional irrigation methods through modern irrigation technology and realizing “on-demand irrigation” can not only increase the utilization rate of water resources and slow down the trend of increasingly tense water resources, but also increase crop output and increase people’s income. The purpose of this paper is to study the smart agricultural irrigation system based on the perception environment of the Internet of Things. Based on wireless sensor network technology, this paper designs and implements an agricultural irrigation intelligent control system. This article fully analyzes the requirements of the farmland irrigation monitoring system, clarifies the functions and design requirements of the system, and designs the overall scheme of the system, and divides the software and hardware modules of the system on the basis of this overall scheme. Starting from the actual application, this article carried out effective practice on the engineering design, equipment debugging and follow-up maintenance of the irrigation system. Through the practice of energy saving, water saving, intelligent control, etc., it provides a demonstration and practice for precision agriculture. Experimental research shows that after adopting low power consumption measures, the battery voltage of the smart agricultural irrigation system used in this paper drops by 0.8 V within 12 h. It can be seen that the low power consumption strategy adopted in this paper can greatly reduce the system power consumption during operation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The development of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) has dramatically changed the way of hotel booking. The increasing number of online consumers provides abundant data for demand forcasting in revenue management. The current methods e.g. historical data analysis, normally focus on studying consumers’ behaviors and preferences in the hotel but may not be able to integrate that out of the hotel such as dining, travelling, shopping and entertaining, which will bring crucial references to the co-relationship between these consumption and the way of hotel booking. This research adopts a persona approach to infer consumers’ preference probability by using a variety of real-time data. Quantitative methods are employed. In order to predict the booking needs accurately, this research establish a Bayesian network on the online platform for life service that can be associated with various consumer behavior data. The results indicate that in the environment of uncertain demand, the algorithm is effective and applicable, which will help directors of hotel revenue management in accurate price planning and decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Dance is a way of emotional expression to the public through body movements. Different dance movements have different emotional contents. At present, to carry out the inheritance and development of dance art, we need to analyze the body movements and language movements one by one, so as to form a systematic dance teaching scheme. However, the dance itself has the characteristics of self-concealment and high difficulty. The traditional dance movement analysis and management has the problems of low recognition efficiency and low recognition accuracy. With the support of computer vision recognition technology, it can import computer equipment, use image processing, machine learning and other disciplines to carry out automatic and information recognition of dance movements. It can be said that the action recognition method supported by computer vision recognition technology provides technical support for the long-term development of dance art inheritance and development. Based on this, this paper carries out the research and analysis of dance action recognition technology under the computer vision recognition technology, aiming to clarify the application principle of dance action recognition technology, and provide support for the sustainable development of motion recognition technology and dance art. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet technology, many traditional lifestyles and education have undergone fundamental changes. At the same time, Internet technology has lowered the threshold of entrepreneurship. Many people with entrepreneurial creativity have begun to use the advantages of the Internet to carry out entrepreneurial activities. This article studies the impact of entrepreneur awe on entrepreneurship in the network environment. Compared with the traditional entrepreneurial form, the threshold of the Internet entrepreneurship environment is low, and the difficulty of entrepreneurship is also less. Opportunity awareness is the starting point of the entire corporate activity and the core element of corporate success. The method of identifying, discovering and using the main entrepreneurs and entrepreneur opportunities in this process is the basic problem in entrepreneur research. This article discusses the influence of entrepreneurs of various enterprises on enterprises, and also studies entrepreneurship. The Internet has brought a certain impact on the thinking and values of college students, directly affecting the employment choices of college students. College students have freshness and curiosity about new things and dare to innovate. College students who are new to society have no rich life experience and insufficient funds. Relying on the Internet to start a business seems to be a very witty path that can help college students to develop their physical and mental health in an all-round way. The research results of this paper, the intensity of entrepreneurial policies and the degree of “Internet+” embodied by new enterprises, the relationship between company age and the number and intensity of “Internet+” entrepreneur policies, and the “Internet+” embodied and inverse U-shaped relationship of new enterprises. Has a negative restrictive effect. The entrepreneurial policy structure with the background of “Internet+” mainly includes five major policies for platform, crowdfunding creation space and infrastructure, financial support, talent introduction and training, technical support, and establishment and improvement of the “dual innovation” service system. The theme and the above-mentioned policy content play an important role in promoting the implementation of “Internet+” in new enterprises. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Because colleges and universities are a special field of socialist construction and development, unlike enterprises and factories, the purpose of this paper is to improve the network reimbursement model of colleges and universities in the context of Informa ionization. Starting from financial control, strengthening internal financial control is one of the important ways to improve the competitiveness of colleges and universities. Similarly, financial control also determines the good capital turnover rate of colleges and universities, and directly affects the operation of colleges and universities. This paper specifically cites the “incentive mechanism” and optimizes the design of the network reimbursement model of colleges and universities by consulting domestic and foreign literature and comparative observation. Therefore, this paper focuses on the financial control of colleges and universities to optimize the financial process of colleges and universities. From the analysis of experimental results, the incentive mechanism in financial management compared with the original after a questionnaire survey has a better response, from the current financial staff’s cognition and quality, strict financial internal management measures, in order to be able to achieve the continuous optimization and innovation of the financial management system in colleges and universities, and achieve the basic goal of modern financial management and continuous progress. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The most important feature of the big data era is the collection, integration and utilization of massive data. Having big data but not taking full advantage of it is a common problem in many organizations. Under this goal, the first task is to establish a data platform, and the teaching management system and the teaching quality in the data platform have the closest relationship. The learning management system makes it easier for teaching managers to obtain data, analyze and analyze it to help improve the quality of teaching, but it also brings new problems. Facing the problems encountered in the use of the current teaching management system, we need to start from several aspects, such as technology and personal, to maximize the effectiveness of the teaching management system to assist in the use of teaching management. This article mainly discusses the application of big data in university teaching management system, and applies it to the development planning of university teaching management. The experimental results show that the use of big data technology plays an irreplaceable role in the development planning of university teaching management systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the process of technological development, the emergence of Building Information Modeling (hereinafter referred to as BIM) has further improved the informatization level of the construction industry. This paper mainly studies the construction cost application system based on BIM cloud data processing. This research summarizes the current status of the development and application of BIM software at home and abroad, as well as the concept and characteristics of BIM technology, by expounding the specific concept, content and application of construction cost management of construction projects. In addition, it also summarizes the current status of construction cost management of traditional construction projects, as well as the problems and causes of construction costs in the traditional project management process. The application of BIM technology in the construction phase is preliminarily summarized, especially the application value in construction cost, so that there is a certain theoretical foundation and in-depth understanding of the application of BIM technology in construction cost of engineering projects. Research shows that the cloud data model is a simplified point cloud model when the compression rate is 41.6%, 32.6%, 41.9%, and 51.2% when the threshold parameters are 0.02 m, 0.04 m, 0.06 m, and 0.08 m, respectively. When the threshold of the distance from the point to the fitted surface is selected as 0.06 m, the compression effect of the BIM algorithm is the best. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Improving the ability of independent innovation and building an innovation-oriented country are the core of the national development strategy and also the key to improving the comprehensive national strength. Abundant government information and data, on the one hand, provide accurate and objective basis for the scientific decision-making of government departments, and on the other hand, pose great challenges to the information screening and data analysis. Data mining is a necessary step in the evolution of e-government from management information system to decision support system [5]. The object of data mining is a theme-oriented, integrated and relatively stable data set. Therefore, a complete system of data must be established before data mining, and a large amount of historical data at different levels and in different formats scattered in several applications or systems must be integrated according to the subject. E-government has made great progress in China in recent years. Government departments at all levels have set up a large number of databases with exponential growth of data. How to use the new data analysis technology to extract the useful information efficiently and accurately from the e-government system has become a practical problem [8]. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

If the traditional tourism management mode is adopted, it cannot fully meet the diversified and personalized needs of tourists. Therefore, combining with mobile Internet technology to build a smart tourism management platform can not only strengthen the tourism management, but also provide more high-quality and efficient services for tourists. Based on this, this paper carried out the research of tourism management system based on mobile Internet. Starting from the current situation of tourism development, after analyzing the needs of different tourist groups, this paper designs a tourism management system including intelligent tour, intelligent guide, intelligent management and other functions, and evaluates the functional objectives of the tourism management system in the form of questionnaire Points. The results show that the digital map service reaches 9.7 in the function target score of tourism management system. It can be seen that the system model has high applicability and scalability, which can help to realize tourism management efficiently. Therefore, it is necessary for the majority of technical personnel to continuously optimize and improve the tourism management system through continuous efforts and practice, using various new technologies, so as to strengthen the application effect of tourism management system, provide tourists with more quality and efficient services, and promote the further development of tourism. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Implementation of health-and-safety-related innovations such as digitalization has many benefits. Digitalization can serve as a tool for monitoring employees’ safety, supporting and improving workplace health promotion, registering and detecting workplace hazardous conditions, setting criteria which influence behaviour of employees, performing training activities, identifying trends in health and safety management, etc. This paper explores the tools and the perceptions of safety managers towards the use of digital OHS systems and proposes new OHS processes for an occupational health module. The existing occupational health tools in different countries are analyzed e.g. EHS Insight, Quentic EHS management software, Australian WHS MONITOR™, VITS. The new proposed OHS processes will automatize the initial training of the employee which enables the safety manager to allocate their time more efficiently. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The grid marketing and grid dispatching systems store four grid structures: stations, lines, transformers, and households. However, because the standards and functional focus of each system data are not unified, the data becomes isolated and not unified. As a result, there are errors in the relationship between the grid files themselves and the files in a single system, and there are also errors in the consistency and relationship of the cross-system grid files, which ultimately leads to inaccurate grid topology. Data graph technology is a graph technology developed based on big data graph database technology. It can also use multiple data knowledge extraction technology and voice recognition technology to intuitively and efficiently construct a grid topology model to realize automatic identification of grid topology. In order to realize the standardized management of the grid structure, it provides powerful conditions. Based on the investigation of a large number of graph databases, this article integrates factors such as distribution, query language, consistency, availability, fault tolerance, scalability, storage backend, etc., and fully combines some of the characteristics of the graph data itself. Starting from the data map technology, the automatic identification model of the power grid marketing data map is built, and the power grid marketing data map is applied to the real marketing data of a power supply company. It can also realize the difference analysis of the cross-system grid structure and find the data. And accurately locate the cause of the data problem, which improves the efficiency of data management for abnormal network topology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The industry is subject to the increasing process of digitalization. While production is quite advanced in this process of change, logistics still consists largely of manual and paper-based processes. The employees in logistics are mostly unskilled and only carry out simple tasks. Due to a high proportion of part-time workers and foreign employees, logistics in general and warehouse logistics in particular place special demands on the introduction of digital technologies. Existing models for technology acceptance hardly take the special features of warehouse logistics into account. For this reason, a differentiated consideration of this domain is necessary in order to adequately reflect the conditions of warehouse logistics. In this paper an adapted acceptance model for warehouse logistics is developed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The emergence of new technologies has brought many advantages to organizations and other sectors, they manage to streamline manual processes and are of vital importance in decision-making. Today many entities decide to make use of emerging technologies that facilitate the work and perform it more effectively, however, the adoption rate is not as high as expected and that is due to a widespread fear due to lack of knowledge of information management and intelligent technologies. It is necessary to analyze the levels and the relationship with the processes where they are involved, that is, how the IT technologies are used and each factor within the university can enrich the university community. The purpose of this article is to present an artificial intelligence adoption model proposal for universities. The IT organizational unit of the universities is in charge of adapting all these “Smart” technologies to the university environment in each of its teachings, research, management, or government facets. The complexity is great, we are talking about very diverse environments with very different needs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={There are many examples of successful enterprises in the market worldwide. All these successful enterprises have some specific advantages or unique techniques to survive in the market. Sustainable development is the key element to ensure survival of modern enterprises which are based on unique technologies in the Industry 4.0. Regardless of sizes and capabilities of enterprises, the availability of new technologies and correct organization allows these enterprises to respond to changing market and consumer demands immediately. In addition to this there are required well-defined methodologies and experience of employees to ensure qualified and timely feedback to improve conditions. There are suggested some technologies in this study. The objectives are to analyze and show effectiveness of these techniques to improve activities and competitive advantages of the cement factory. Additionally, these technologies resulted in significant saving on costs in the cement factory. Application of these modern methods and technologies resulted in reliable conditions for improvement of competitive advantage, adaptive management, sustainable development, planning as well as optimization of expenses in the cement factory in the Republic of Azerbaijan in the year 2020 as well as in the short and long term. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Since the insertion of CRM in companies, positive effects had been generated in the management of the relationship with customers, due to the influence generated by the inclusion of updated technology as a strategy to improve service and customer service. With these statements, the research presents the historical evolution of the technological tools used in customer service, to establish those that still predominate and may remain in the future, due to their utilities and benefits. For this, the research develops a study with a historical approach of these technological tools to know which ones were used in the past, present and future, and thanks to the contribution of several authors, establish the advantages and disadvantages of each one. As a result, it is evident that the tools used in customer service in the past are still indispensable in the present, however, their permanence depends on their evolution, and until then, the most representative ones are the internet and social networks. Finally, for future customer service, systems and models that involve quality as an essential factor. In conclusion, the first findings show that the customer service of the past lacks enough technology to sophisticate the services provided to customers, but the recurring technological evolution provides greater benefits with possible competitive advantage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The article is devoted to the topical issue of introduction and use of digital technologies of public administration in the process of digitalization of the state and society. The article describes the features of building a digital state and its relationship with automation based on “soft models”. It is necessary to modernize the existing social infrastructure. The problems of uncertainty or under-determination in the management of the economy, social sphere, legal regulation, etc. are primarily faced with the challenges in the field of digitalization facing the country. The development of legal mechanisms to combat corruption is becoming a significant and urgent problem for the development of modern Russian society and the state. For the implementation of fuzzy control systems, on the one hand, there is an uncertainty associated with both the lack of information and the complexity of the system, and the impracticability or inexpediency of describing it in traditional ways, and, on the other hand, the presence of the necessary control actions, disturbances, etc. about the object. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the article a neuro-fuzzy hybrid intellectual model of risk classification and management is developed. Due to the limited capabilities of traditional methods of mathematical modeling, intelligent data analysis technologies are used to solve poorly formed problems, including risk-related problems. They are based on soft computing methods (Soft Calculation, Soft Computing) and Computational Intelligence, which is based on this theoretical and methodological basis. The main components of these directions are fuzzy sets, fuzzy logical inferences, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and neural network-based computational theories. Intellectual computing technologies make it possible to obtain solutions with practically sufficient accuracy through training on the basis of limited, incomplete and qualitatively described initial data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The road infrastructure represents a strategic area for the planification and development of urban and rural environments. In this context, essential facilities such as bridges are subject to damages mainly due to the daily load that represents the vehicular traffic, the environmental conditions and also due to the natural degradation of the structural elements. Therefore, it is fundamental performs a continuous evaluation about the state of an infrastructure. Following, this purpose, this paper presents an architecture for the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) focused on bridges. The proposal solution involves the application of emerging technologies such as MEMS accelerometers, IoT devices and the deployment of a Wireless Sensor Network topology. Particularly, the architecture implemented consists of a set of ten sensor nodes which are management and synchronized by means of a central station. Furthermore, an additional node with capacity of capture and video recording was implemented Therefore, this last node provides to the system with a visual option for identifying the connection between the accelerations values and the vehicular traffic. In order to evaluated the system, the architecture was deployed along a bridge characterized by a heavy traffic load. Results on the scenario reveals the system allows for determining the main parameters related to state of the structure (i.e., acceleration values, load distribution and the fundamental frequencies of vibration). Consequently, the proposal architecture contributes significantly in the development of solutions focused in the analysis and early detection of damages on essentials structures or facilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Ecological cybernetics of technological processes, both as a scientific and educational subject, along with the improvement of theoretical knowledge in the application of technological processes improved by nanotechnologies, where the design technologies are intensively updated with new hardware and software of design technologies, will allow providing professional approach to the project development, ecological expertise as an environmental engineer. It is known that the performance of technological processes optimally reduces its impact on the environment. However, this does not answer the question of how much. In my view, studying ecological cybernetics of technological processes will provide the evaluation of ecological level in technological processes performed under complex technological, constructive design conditions. In other words, each optimum oil processing and petrochemical processes must be investigated as a research object, and technological and constructive parameters of the equipment, efficiency of the catalysts in the process, the composition of the raw material, processing depth must be studied, improved and brought to more advanced stages. It is known that re-refining of oil and petrochemical processes are performed in the combination of more complex conversions and more complex structural design of equipment and one of the useful ways of improving ecological condition is to determine a new level by increasing cybernetic bases of the process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The social identity of the founders focuses on how individuals identify and understand themselves as entrepreneurs, it has been shown that the intellectual abilities and nature of leaders are manifested in the creation and management of their companies and the results that these get. The research defines a model adjusted by structural equations to measure the types of Darwinian, Missionary and Communitarian social identity of companies’ founders in Ecuador. In the application of the model, it is evidenced that there is an inclination of these founders towards missionary identity, followed by Darwinian, as pure identities, thus a significant percentage of the hybrid Darwinian/missionary is also obtained as a result (13.2%). It is evident that there is no significant difference between the variables gender, age, professional training and company sector, and the type of identity. Except between the missionary identity and the formation of the founder. The study shows the importance of relating the type of social identity with relevant business results such as the capacity for innovation in companies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Cyber security is the most important part of our technologically dependent lives today. Government institutions, financial firms, public and private services, nuclear power stations, power grid providers, water supplies or wastewater disposal corporations use information technology in their day-to-day activities. Anything that uses technology is focused on connectivity and computer networks, which ensures that it relies on cyber security. Every year, the public and private sectors spend millions of dollars on technology, protection tools and hardware that can improve cyber security within their businesses, but are still vulnerable. The key problem with this situation is that data defense is now generally viewed as a technological component or technology that can be quickly introduced within the enterprise, and this application would ensure cyber protection. This mentality needs to change, because cyber security is more than mere technology nowadays. This post presents the taxonomy of critical infrastructure threats, analyses attack vectors and attack tactics used to destroy critical infrastructure, as well as the most frequent cyber security failures that companies create in the area of cyber security while attempting to make themselves safer from vulnerabilities. The main purpose of this article is to include technical elements of the cyber security management model that can be used to ensure the protection of sensitive infrastructure in an enterprise or business. The network protection management model discussed in this article is examined from a management viewpoint and does not discuss the technical issues and products used to secure sensitive infrastructure from cyber security threats and vulnerabilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This article describes the experience of introducing real-world projects into the curriculum of the Department of Innovation in Chemical Technology of Kazan National Research Technological University. The authors examined the challenges of developing competencies of practical project management in undergraduate students, and applied new teaching methods to develop and implement projects in practice. This technique allows the graduating students to build their competencies and satisfy the requirements of their future employers. Therefore, the task was set: to form teams to work on real projects for chemical enterprises with a full immersion in the design process. Students were assigned to project teams according to their area of interest. Students were given surveys on their personality and style of decision making to learn about themselves. Based the student’s interest and on these surveys, a self-portrait of each participant was developed and used to help organize the team, define roles and establish corresponding project tasks. During this implementation, students developed projects offered by Egida, one of Russia’s leaders in polyurethane foam production for mattresses. Having mattresses fit into the 2030 goal of a circular economy is a looming challenge for this industry. Egida divided this complex problem into several key areas and challenged the teams to develop innovative solutions. The solutions developed by the students in the process of their project helped the enterprise highlight new ways of development for itself. Students were given a survey to get feedback and help improve the approach. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper describes on the education program that we have developed for colleges of technology in Japan. The college of technology in Japan is Japan’s unique educational system that aims at high-school and college-age students. The five-year consistent education system specializing in engineering has garnered attention under the name of KOSEN from Asian nations. Thus, this paper assumes the second-grade students at our college of technology to be students who have not been introduced to PBL yet. The group activity-based PBL (Project Based Learning) process requires the ability to express one’s own ideas to others (communication skill), the ability to abstract problems and develop one’s thoughts (computational thinking skill), and the ability to move ahead with tasks in a planned manner (project management skill). Therefore, targeting these students, this study examines whether digital storytelling practice is feasible as an education program that broadens the above mentioned three skills. It is required in digital storytelling to condense one’s thoughts and present them as digital contents. We think that the affinity is strong between digital storytelling and PBL, as the processes that learners experience through digital storytelling activities are similar to learners’ experience in the processes of the PBL program that is based on our engineering design process. According to a questionnaire survey conducted after the class, our education program received positive feedback from 90% of the students who took the course. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Home automation system is a technological solution. It is the action of applying technology to solve a problem at home. It uses hardware and software technologies that enables control and management over appliances and devices within a home. In this paper, we have developed a low-cost automated door lock system so users can operate systems from anywhere all over the world with internet access. IoT concept is applied in the system development including integration of software and hardware for communication and execution tasks. By using a WIFI enabled microcontroller and connecting devices and user’s apps via MQTT protocol, a smart door lock using IoT application has successfully built.

abstract={In the subject structure, the subject of Risk Management belongs to the main topics of the essential knowledge in the field of study Safety Sciences. The survey carried out in the expert public showed that the weak preparation of students to solve practical problems was one of their most significant lacks and disadvantages. The objective to improve the preparedness of students for real practice was the main challenge for innovations in teaching this subject. The implementation of the activating method of project education helped to achieve better knowledge and improve skills and competences of students. Outsourcing of real tasks, application of the specific technique in analysing and assessing of risks, teamwork and self-evaluation of achieved results, comparing of outputs, persuasive argumentation represent the results of project education, and they were valid also in this subject. A questionnaire survey, which respondents were the students, verified this project education. After implementing this innovative form of teaching, students compared their knowledge at the beginning and the end of the teaching process. The obtained results confirmed that the method of project education increased students’ interest in this subject. The subject of Risk Management has become more attractive for students, and their preparation for the lessons has improved, as well. The students also confirmed that the method of project teaching had increased their knowledge in the given subject. At the same time, the teamwork has also brought along a more objective mutual evaluation of students between themselves. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The current study facilitates an evidence-based discussion on teaching during the period of an abrupt shift to virtual classrooms caused by coronavirus spread. There has been a massive investment to bring technology to universities; however, there are some significant gaps that must be addressed. The first is the availability of university online platforms and the second is the digitalization of the curriculum combined with teachers’ confusion and anxiety around the ability to adjust to the new digital environment. The study is aimed to research the current situation at two Russian universities: RUDN (People’s Friendship University of Russia) and PNRPU (Perm National Research Polytechnic University) and describe what changes have been implemented into teaching by the university administration and professors. The research questions include two groups: 1) Learning management system (LMS): Did the university offer a teaching platform to be used by all teachers? Or was it an individual choice of every teacher? 2) Curriculum: Did teachers have to modify the content of their course? In what way? Our study contributes several meaningful findings regarding understanding the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges in changing the education landscape. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Freeway is the traffic artery between cities, which is related to the external development ability of the city, and has a great impact on the national economy, so the highway engineering project is very important. However, due to the large volume, many factors involved, and the engineering structure is relatively special compared with the ordinary highway, quality problems often occur. At this time, relevant organizations must strengthen the management work, and BIM Technology can be used with the help of technical advantages and characteristics, we can fully understand the situation from the construction to the completion of the project, find out the problems at any time, and make corresponding decisions. In order to achieve this goal, this paper will carry out relevant research, mainly based on BIM Technology, put forward the construction scheme of expressway information management platform, and put the scheme into practical application, show the specific application mode of the platform, and verify the effectiveness of the scheme. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the advent of the new media era, the application of computer network education management has become more and more extensive. Some universities in our country have opened computer network education courses, and university computer network education management has become an indispensable part. This article takes the computer network education management as a breakthrough point, and proposes several aspects to analyze and improve the problems existing in the computer network education management of our country’s universities. However, the information transmission of computer network greatly increases the risk of various information leakage. For this reason, relevant people should strengthen the research on computer network information security in the era of new media and further optimize the application environment of computer networks in our country. At present, the application of computer network technology in university computer network education management should be based on the application value of computer network technology, formulate targeted application strategies, improve the comprehensive efficiency of modern university teaching management, and promote the overall development of universities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the context of big data, adding data analysis and processing to the teaching system of IT-supported courses of economics and management majors is of great significance to improving the comprehensive quality of students. This article aims to study the teaching system of IT supporting courses based on big data technology. This article adopts the method of experimental investigation to randomly survey the students’ performance of economics and management majors in a certain college that offers big data technology and application majors, and conducts research on this. Experimental data shows that from the perspective of student feedback and test results, students’ interest in learning and learning effects have been greatly improved. The results of the experiment show that the student’s score in the IT-supported course teaching system for economics and management based on big data is 89.89 ± 5.45, which is higher than the traditional learning score of 79.51 ± 5.99. Both in basic knowledge mastery and practical teaching are better than the control group. In the process of exploring the construction of IT supporting teaching system for economics and management majors in the era of big data, there is still a lot of work to be done. In the next teaching and research, we will study the teaching mode and assessment mode of IT supporting courses for economics and management majors under the background of big data. Design, etc. to be discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of socialist economy, all walks of life in society pay more and more attention to the development of information technology, and because of the development of information technology, information technology is more and more used in enterprise financial management. In recent years, the arrival of big data era has played an important role in the development of corporate accounting. Accounting informatization greatly improves the efficiency of enterprise accounting. However, with the continuous development of information technology, it also brings some risks and security risks to the financial management of enterprises. Therefore, this paper discusses the impact of accounting informatization on enterprise financial management in the era of big data. In this paper, we set up the experimental class and the control class. The experimental class uses accounting information to work, while the control class uses the traditional working mode. At the end of the experiment, through comparative analysis, it shows that accounting informatization can improve the working speed of enterprise accounting workers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In this fast-paced era, how to quickly estimate the cost of construction projects has become the focus of research in this field. Due to the traditional cost engineering, the calculation result error will be relatively large. With the continuous development of computer and the emergence of artificial intelligence, people gradually combine the mathematical model with the computer to seek a satisfactory evaluation model to solve some problems in the project. Therefore, how to use artificial intelligence technology to quickly and accurately calculate the project cost has become the current research direction. In this paper, through network information resources, information resource database and other ways, it is concluded that the roof cost may be increased due to the increase of construction vertical transportation volume; according to the statistical analysis of relevant data, the cost can be reduced by 1.2%–1.5% for every 10 cm reduction of residential floor height. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the development of information technology and global economic integration, supply chain management has become a research hotspot in global management science. This article uses an electronic product as a supply chain management system. Based on the mathematical model and algorithm of supply chain design, the experiment designs an experiment based on traditional predictive models and optimized models to predict and analyze the sales of a certain electronic product. Experimental data shows that in order to adapt to the characteristics of supply chain demand forecasting in a big data environment, the proposed optimization model and method are reliable and practical. The experimental results show that the nine-month sales of the traditional prediction model are: 32, 38, 58, 57, 66, 73, 81, 90, 93, and the sales of the prediction model optimized by the cross genetic algorithm are: 41, 58, 72, 84, 95, 104, 103, 107, 92, to make up for the shortcomings of the model’s insufficient generalization ability under the high-dimensional situation, reduce the error of demand forecasting, and provide supply chain demand forecasting under the background of big data Effective forecasting methods have greatly alleviated the defects in supply chain management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of information technology, video monitoring system has become an important part of modern city security system. Especially in prisons, surveillance cameras are almost everywhere. The concept of guided wave spread spectrum digital data communication in intelligent structure is proposed. However, with the continuous expansion of the monitoring network, surveillance cameras not only bring convenience, but also produce a lot of monitoring data, which brings great challenges to storage, analysis and retrieval. China is a big animal husbandry country. The development of animal husbandry directly affects the development of national economy. It is necessary to develop a new animal husbandry monitoring system based on Internet of things technology, which can detect the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and other information parameters in the process of animal growth. In order to monitor the growth quickly and accurately and realize the automation and intelligent control, an intelligent real-time monitoring system based on single chip microcomputer is designed. Animal husbandry monitoring system completes the planning and management of animal growth mode by collecting, monitoring and timely alarming the information of animal growth environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This study discusses how the Jakarta government improves public transportation policies to create sustainable and integrated public transportation in Jakarta with a sustainable development approach (SDGs) at point 11 (eleven). The high demand for public transport and unintegrated management has led the DKI Jakarta transport system to become a complex issue and seems to have failed to meet its objectives. The lack of a sustainable transport policy has made congestion that can never be resolved. This study will identify the root problem that causes congestion in DKI Jakarta and find the best way to address the issues by considering the program’s sustainability using an explorative qualitative method. Sustainable and integrated public transportation is a refinement of existing public transportation that involves the government, private sector, and society by including other important actors. The concept of sustainable and integrated public transportation development is also a form of innovation towards changes in the transportation sector by involving various actors in building public transportation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Modern economy is innovative and the main factor in developing competitive production is training of engineering specialists with intellectual and creative capabilities The proposed methodology, based on the combination of two areas of training (economics and chemical engineering), provides training for highly qualified specialists in the field of polymer chemistry. Its effectiveness is confirmed by the high demand of the management of the chemical industry, improving the skills of their employees in these programs. The methodology for constructing the educational program and the organization of the educational process is in close cooperation between the university and industry. These programs are aimed at ensuring that teachers perceive this training as an opportunity to reveal the entrepreneurial spirit for students to be more entrepreneurial in their follow-up activities. Entrepreneurial skills allow graduates to conduct business more rationally and purposefully, focusing on pre-planned results. The presence of these skills significantly increases their value in the labor market. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the availability of affordable high-quality recording hardware and video management platforms lecture recording becomes a popular service for students at a steadily increasing number of universities. Since each university has its own infrastructure and general conditions, the introduction is still an individual process requiring a lot of technical know-how and a clear definition of the workflow process. At our university, we currently have about 740 recorded lectures, providing students access via our Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle and via an open source video portal. With a main focus on barrier-free access to learning material in general and hearing-impaired students in specific, we wanted to provide subtitles for all recordings. In addition, subtitles are also very helpful for students who do not have German (our main university language) as their mother tongue. Subtitles should be at least in German, preferably also in other languages in order to support foreign students (such as Erasmus) at our university as well. In this paper we will share our experiences how to efficiently create subtitles in a semi-automatic way. Furthermore, we will share the lessons learned with the introduction of the Open Cast platform and which technical workflow we particularly defined. This workflow is optimized for a moderate growth of recorded lectures – hence feasible for small and medium sized universities – and ensures a maximum of quality. It can be easily adapted to other universities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In modern conditions, the success of the economic entities activities largely depends on their awareness and ability to use information about their internal resources and external market environment effectively. The preparation and adoption of economic decisions at various levels of a management system requires processing of a large amount of accounting information, its comparison, analysis, interpretation. Accounting system is faced with problems of integrating various types of accounting: management, tax, social, environmental, etc. Along with the data of accomplished facts of economic life, functions of an accountant-analyst are expanded through formation and preparation of forecast information about future financial results and directions of business entities development. Modern discoveries in the field of information technologies (open technological platforms, cloud technologies, unified international format for submitting financial statements in electronic form, etc.) significantly expand the possibilities of building an accounting system that integrates data on internal business processes of an economic entity and external market environment. Electronic reference and information systems are becoming more and more widely used in accounting, the development perspective of which is accumulation and systematization of professional knowledge in the field of accounting, analysis, and audit in specialized knowledge bases. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Exponential growth of innovations and the penetration of information technology into all spheres of life are actively increasing the demand for IT sector engineers and competences of graduates from university IT-courses. Key educational innovations in ICT include open educational resources (OER). It is important for IT sector engineers to master the skills of working with OER, which are a powerful tool for increasing learning possibilities and further education and training. However, little attention has been paid to using OER in face-to-face university courses. The paper presents the findings form a research that was aimed at using OER in one-semester Psychology and Pedagogy course by undergraduate full-time students in Computer Science and Computer Engineering and System Analysis and Management at Kazan National Research Technological University. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The article examines the concept of balance sheet liquidity and proposes its improvement in modern financial analysis, which will facilitate the procedure of assessing the risks and prospects for improving the solvency and liquidity of the enterprise in the age of digital technologies. The opinions of well-known world scientists-analysts on the essence of balance sheet liquidity are reflected, debatable issues are revealed and proposals for their elimination are developed. The author's improved notion of the essence of balance sheet liquidity in the modern financial analysis is given. The concept of balance sheet liquidity limit is proposed. The method of determining the absolutely liquid type of balance has been improved. For the first time its dependence on a kind of activity of the enterprise is established. According to the balance sheet (statement of financial position) of State Enterprise of the Service Air Traffic of Ukraine as an example of the implementation of the proposed theoretical and methodological provisions for the analysis of balance sheet liquidity is shown. The proposed forms of analytical tables will contribute to the unification of analytical calculations and increase the clarity and informativeness of analytical conclusions on the liquidity of the balance in terms of digital technologies. The results of the study are useful for users in order to make the right management decisions in the digital age. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The paper theoretically substantiates the need for managerial skills development in engineering students. The paper is focused on the basic traits necessary for the successful formation of managerial skills in engineering students, the impact of gender and “emotional quotient” (EQ) on leadership style, and the development of “hard” and “soft” skills. For a manager, there are no absolutely bad or good personal qualities, but their totality is a manageable resource. The gender factor here has a significant impact on management style and quality. Training programs based on students’ personal characteristics and specific needs, a combination of coaching, training and individual classes guarantee the required level of managerial knowledge and skills. The emphasis is on the fact that training technologies and coaching methods are effective for the formation and development of managerial skills among students of engineering specialties. The authors believe that under current conditions, a greater emphasis in management practice should be placed on innovative principles and methods related to the formation and development of neuroplasticity, Neuro Science, EQ, etc. in engineering students. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The study is based on a method developed by the authors for assessing the current organizational potential in accordance with the requirements and characteristics of the digitalization process. The method includes an extended classification of management problems in conditions of increasing uncertainty and the rate of change in the business environment, a methodology for assessing (calculating quantitative values) the main parameters of the Digital Transformation Snake model (DTS model), a graphical representation of a digital transformation model based on improving the organization’s personnel structure. The DTS model includes the identification of two zones of organizational impact on the workforce of the organization: the zone of restructuring of the workforce and the zone of personnel development. The conclusion is made about the use of various technologies for improving the organization’s personnel to achieve a successful digital transformation.

abstract={With the rise of educational technology, the flipped classroom mode is booming. Students watch teaching videos after class, complete homework and internalize knowledge in class, which makes both teachers and students benefit a lot. For students, the autonomy of learning has been greatly strengthened, the learning time after class is flexible, and the limited time is maximized in class; for teachers, although the workload increases, it is conducive to their own strict requirements, and teachers should ensure that they can answer students’ questions at any time. It can be seen that both teachers and students in the flipped classroom are being pushed forward. In order to ensure the efficient learning of students after class, the application of learning management system is essential. Through the combination of flipped classroom teaching mode and network learning management system, the learning time after class is freely grasped by students, which is flexible and efficient. Classroom time is more applied to the interaction and cooperation between teachers and students. In this way, we can increase the classroom capacity and help Chinese teachers to become real preachers, educators and puzzlers. The main research questions are as follows: first, in the flipped classroom based on canvas, what are the students’ attitudes towards language and knowledge acquisition? Second, what learning strategies do students adopt in the learning process? Third, what are the new gains of flipped classroom experience compared with the traditional classroom? The survey results show that the flipped classroom teaching mode can indeed improve the traditional teaching mode - some questions Question. In this mode, students interact with each other more intensively and the classroom is more humanized. Students’ communication skills, self-confidence and knowledge acquisition are all improved. However, different students have different understanding of the validity of this teaching method due to their different understanding of the certainty, authority, source of knowledge, the real meaning of learning content and the measurability and importance of learning results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Based on the rapid development of modern science and technology, modern computer technology has developed to a certain degree of maturity. As one of the pillars of China’s economy, how to optimize the financial management of construction enterprises in China has become one of the problems that experts and scholars think about. First of all, the computer age has brought a more complete and accurate data analysis platform to the financial management of enterprises. The emergence and development of everything has two sides. The advent of the computer age has also had a certain impact on the traditional financial management of enterprises. Therefore, enterprise financial management is facing new challenges in the field of computer technology. Enterprise financial management must be innovated and reformed. Through the implementation of computer technology, to create a new era of enterprise financial management reform and innovation, through literature research, output analysis and other methods, this paper concludes that the investors of construction companies have different attitudes towards risk management, among which risk aversion accounts for up to 55%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a broad solution that cost-effectively delivers information technology as a service that encourages organizations and individuals to transfer their data and applications to the cloud. It may be used for storing and accessing sensitive information on servers beyond the management and control of the customers making this information susceptible to malicious attacks. Therefore, data security is a fundamental issue that limits the benefits of this technology. Cryptography plays an important role in achieving an appropriate level of data security on the cloud. Hybrid cryptography exploits the advantages of symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems by blending them instead of applying separately. In this article, an experimental survey has been conducted on the trending hybrid cryptographic models to secure information on the cloud within the period from 2017 to 2020. Each model was reviewed and simulated separately by explaining the methodology, its advantages, weaknesses, and application areas. An important point in this article is the implementation of all of these models using the Python programming language then an analytical comparison of the results was obtained in terms of encryption time and throughput. We aim to provide a scientific contribution in the field of information security in the cloud computing environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the development of social economy and the expansion of the scale of iron and steel enterprises, as an important symbol of national industrialization level and international competitiveness, energy management of iron and steel enterprises has gradually become the key issue of national development strategy and national long-term interests. In recent years, with the rapid development of big data technology, the application of big data technology in energy scheduling of iron and steel enterprises is more extensive. At present, most dispatchers of iron and steel enterprises estimate roughly the fluctuation of blast furnace gas production in the future based on historical data, and the accuracy of the estimation mainly depends on the experience of the dispatchers. At the same time, the existing point by point prediction model cannot meet the requirements of energy system for prediction accuracy. Through long-term field research and investigation, it is found that the dispatcher often pays more attention to the reliability of its estimation results, rather than a single estimation value. With the support of today’s big data. The decision support based on data analysis is being integrated into the energy management ideas of equipment manufacturing enterprises, which improves the level of energy management of equipment manufacturing enterprises, optimizes the industrial structure of enterprises, improves work efficiency and creates social wealth. Through literature research and other methods, and through certain experiments, it is concluded that the average energy consumption of China’s steel industry is 15% higher than that of the world-class countries; and in the cost of energy consumption, the average level of China’s enterprises is about 30%, and some enterprises even exceed 40%. It can be seen that China’s iron and steel enterprises are still struggling in energy conservation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The management of engineering projects has the important characteristics of high technology and complex engineering. It is embodied in the construction of large-scale projects. The work flow will be quite numerous and complex, especially many engineering personnel. Facing such a responsible situation, it is easy to have problems in management, so it is necessary to manage technology reasonably and efficiently. Among these problems, it is possible to cause information loss, information error or omission due to the large amount of engineering information and documents. According to the statistical analysis of big data, two thirds of the problems in project management in large-scale engineering construction projects are all caused by the problem of information exchange. In addition, there is a big problem related to the cost change and information exchange, which eventually leads to a great cost in the construction of the project. Therefore, it is very important to manage the construction of the project by means of computer and electronic information technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={High-tech industries such as semiconductors have become important pillars of Taiwan’s economy under the raging COVID-19 epidemic. The MES system actively collects and monitors the production materials generated in the manufacturing process and integrates the core business required by the company’s production such as orders, suppliers, property management, production, equipment maintenance, quality control, and other processes to improve the company’s manufacturing process and production efficiency. Big Data of the process is the foundation of information. Good data quality is the basic condition for effective data analysis applications such as OLAP and data mining. The recursive field matching algorithm uses the recursive structure of the text field. The Sorted-Neighborhood Method (SNM) algorithm cannot solve all the matching records detected by a single keyword. Data cleaning is a relatively mature field that expects more breakthroughs and innovations. There is still a lot of room for technological development, but there is still a lot of work to be done, the specific recommendations already provided. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the era of big data, the mastery of information will determine the development strategy of an enterprise and even the country to a certain extent. Therefore, information service is also born in this context. Information precision service is the development trend of information service in the future, but the research in this field is still insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes the research of information precision service based on big data technology. This paper makes an in-depth study on the information precision service and the application of big data in this field. It is analyzed that the system development technology for precision information service is relatively backward, and there are technical problems with low quality, and big data technology can better remedy the shortcomings in this respect. According to the actual needs of information precision service, combined with the characteristics of big data technology, this paper optimizes and improves the traditional big data information classification algorithm, making the optimized algorithm more suitable for the application in the field of information precision service. In order to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, this paper establishes a corresponding test experiment. In the process of the experiment, the frank and MHR methods are compared with the proposed method, including map and MHR P@k Detection of two indicators. The experimental results show that the proposed method is 10.4% higher than MHR method in map detection, P@k the value increased more, reaching 10.6%. The analysis shows that the performance of information precision service detection method based on big data technology is significantly improved compared with traditional methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={As an important aspect of the overall evaluation of education, teaching quality evaluation in Colleges and universities is not only the main body and foundation of education evaluation, but also an indispensable part in teaching activities. The development of information technology on the Internet has accumulated a lot of data for teaching and management, and created a prerequisite for the construction. Still in the primary stage of data backup, query and simple statistics, and the mining and analysis of evaluation data is still in the stage of manual processing, which makes these data unable to give full play its due value. Nowadays, “survival by quality” has become the inevitable choice of every university. Whether the teaching quality can be guaranteed or not depends on the teaching quality and teaching level of teachers. Therefore, we must have a scientific evaluation system to monitor the teaching quality of teachers. In this paper, how to make more scientific and reasonable use rationally analyze and guide teachers’ teaching is deeply studied. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In recent years, with the development of science and technology, in order to further explore the world, we explore and study the supply management of automobile enterprise procurement parts based on block chain technology. Based on the reality of China's automobile industry supply chain, combined with the advanced supply chain management theory at home and abroad, this paper makes a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the automobile industry supply chain by combining theoretical research with enterprise cases, and tries to explain in theory, refine the method and structure of the supply chain, and construct the precise supply chain system and fine supply chain of the automobile industry management system and efficiency evaluation system. Based on the analysis of the subjective and objective elements and their interaction in the supply chain, an accurate comprehensive cost model of the supply chain is established. In order to achieve the balance between customer satisfaction and supply chain operation cost, the supply chain structure and operation process are designed in turn. The basic structure of the Bit coin system is designed and realized with the help of block chain technology. It can be said that the basic system of Bit coin is constituted by the block chain. Block chain technology has been considered by professionals to be a very promising technology since its discovery.

abstract={The enhanced use of services like multimedia demands a saving of energy as the top priority for mobile devices. But extension of life time of battery in mobile devices is very difficult and it can’t be handled as expected. For this purpose, reduction in the consumption of energy in every job where these devices are used is critical. In this research work, a new routing protocol called JOKER which is opportunistic in nature is presented. This research work shows new ideas in selection of candidate and coordination phases, which allows enhancing network performance which supports multimedia traffic along with increasing the energy efficiency of the nodes. In the proposed system, the client has to request videos to the file server, and the file server will distribute the frame to the neighbours. In this system we are considering the two neighbours, neighbour1 and neighbour2 and both neighbours are receiving the frames from the file server alternatively. Finally the client will be receiving the videos from the neighbours. By using this proposed system, we can reduce the time consumed. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the continuous progress of social production technology and the continuous increase of car ownership, environmental and energy issues have become increasingly prominent. Electric vehicles can significantly reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of clean energy, which is of great significance to the development of cities. As electric vehicles are a means of replacing traditional fuel vehicles, this paper analyzes the game process between fuel vehicles and electric vehicles after the introduction of electric vehicles based on evolutionary games. Based on the type of consumers choosing to buy a car, the characteristics of electric vehicles and fuel vehicles are analyzed, and the influence of the service level of electric vehicles due to scientific research input factors and government participation in management factors is considered to establish an evolutionary game between electric vehicles and fuel vehicles model. According to the relevant knowledge of dynamics, the parameters of the model are analyzed to obtain the conditions for the stability of each equilibrium point. By analyzing the steady state of system evolution, it provides theoretical support for the green development of electric vehicles and the formulation of related government policies. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of Internet technology and information technology, a digital intelligent learning system has brought a lot of convenience for information storage, transmission, and authentication process. However, the existing intelligent learning information system stores the data in the centralized database, which has a weak anti-risk ability for network attacks. The internal personnel of the system can also tamper with the data and erase the operation trace. Given the above problems, this paper applies blockchain technology to the construction of an intelligent learning system and studies the construction of intelligent learning systems under the background of blockchain technology. This paper compares and analyzes the concept of centralized management and decentralized management, points out the defects of the information centralized storage scheme of the intelligent learning system, and analyzes the shortcomings of the existing information system of blockchain intelligent learning system. Using appropriate blockchain technology and web technology, a four-layer blockchain application architecture is designed, which is composed of a blockchain layer, contract layer, data interaction layer, and application layer. We designed and developed the blockchain credit record module and certificate storage and forensics, realized the input and query of relevant information on the blockchain, and ensured the security and reliable traceability of information. The system construction based on the application of blockchain technology in intelligent learning is designed and developed, which takes the characteristics of decentralized blockchain technology and permanent preservation of data traces, records teaching information, and relevant operation records, and has the advantages of safe, reliable and reliable traceability, which makes exploration for the application of blockchain technology in the field of learning. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of the Internet and the rapid development of e-commerce, online shopping platforms have become popular. In recent years, driven by the spirit of the state’s advocacy of economizing campuses, many campuses have seen a boom in second-hand commodity trading. It is necessary to make full and reasonable use of second-hand goods, so this article considers that it is necessary to establish a campus second-hand market trading website based on the actual selection of multiple universities. The campus second-hand market transaction system is a typical example of the integration of computer technology and economics technology. Using this system can timely release transaction information and complete online transactions. The system discussed in this article is a combination of C# and SQL, based on the B/S mode of web application software, to achieve the collection and management of student secondary market trading goods related information. This article first analyzes the background and significance of building a campus secondary market trading system, and proposes a website design idea; then introduces the tool technology required to build a campus secondary market trading system, and finally explains the design of each module required by the system Give the overall functional design and database design of the website. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: COVID-19 is a disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has spread rapidly around the world. In this paper we first define the technologies of 4.0 industry used to control the pandemic. Objective: To describe the use of technology in the control of COVID-19 in Peru. Materials and methods: Systematic review of applied technologies for COVID-19 management in Peru. The revision was limited to material published in Spanish and English, preferably from indexed sources and official websites, since January 2020. Results: There are different technological solutions implemented in different countries for prevention and containment; some of them have been considered by the Peruvian government, according to the reality of technological and digital development of the country. Discussion and Conclusion: This article reviews the main Industry 4.0 technological solutions implemented around the world to appropriately manage the global health emergency. Some of these solutions, applied for pandemic control, are utilized in the strategies design by Peruvian Government; however, there are other technologies not used yet that have been identified as appropriate. In addition, some improvements in the solutions and policies are discussed, concluding that even if technology plays an important role for COVID-19 control, it is not the only factor affecting the results, as human approach and state policies are crucial for better outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={University identification is one of the important ways to ensure the security management of today’s open campus. It can effectively detect and identify the suspicious person’s identity and ensure the security of the university campus. However, traditional university identity recognition systems have slow detection speeds, relatively low recognition rates, and inability to process low-resolution images. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a university identity recognition system based on FaceNet and FSRNet. Combining virtual sample generation technology, face rectification algorithm, and improved MTCNN face detection. It effectively improves performance indicators such as detection speed and recognition rate, and provides solutions for low-resolution face images. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional university identity recognition system, the implementation method proposed in this paper improves the recognition rate of unconstrained natural environment by 1–2%, reduces the system face detection time, and effectively resolves low-resolution Facial face image for information restoration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the emergence and widespread application of intelligent technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data, many researchers have also begun to combine emerging technologies with food traceability systems. These studies have made innovations in data query and reading platforms or related encryption technologies. However, in traditional food traceability systems, data management information is still scattered, difficult to share, and difficult to trace. The purpose of this article is to study the food safety traceability technology based on blockchain technology. Based on the theoretical basis of blockchain technology, this paper proposes a traceability scheme formed by the combination of reverse search and recursive algorithm. Finally, this paper designs and implements a food safety traceability system. The experimental results show that the scheme proposed in this paper is more efficient than traditional traceability models. And by testing the performance of the system, the test results show that the system can meet the demand. In this paper, through testing the traceability rate of different schemes, the traceability rate of the scheme proposed in this paper is stable at about 1000 ms. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Reinsurance is a strategy used by the insurer to protect themselves from underwriting risk. In this line, an insurer acquires an insurance policy from another called reinsurer. In this way, the contractual responsibility that must be fulfilled between these two entities is specified. Thus, collaborative and transparent efforts are required in this business. In addition, automatic processing and the integrity of the information flow must be guaranteed. Faced with these challenges, blockchain is an innovative technology that allows registering and automating operations using smart contracts and complex cryptographic mechanisms that provide trust and integrity for transactions, without the need for third-party supervision. With these characteristics, this research explores how blockchain technology can become a collaborative and supportive tool in reinsurance contracts. For this, a layered overview and model are designed. Contributions and conclusions are provided at the end of the document. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Along With the progress of the times and the rapid development of science and technology, the era of the Internet of Everything has arrived, and the rise of blockchain has opened a new chapter in technology. It has gradually been applied to the fields of finance, the Internet of Things, logistics, and public services, and has also developed rapidly in financial supply chain. With the support of blockchain technology, the digitization of accounts receivable, bills, warehouse receipts and other assets can be realized, and the data is retained to reduce the risk of ticket fraud and repeated pledge, alleviate the problem of information asymmetry, and reflect the blockchain. The smart contract properties of the company ensure the smooth development of supply chain financial services. However, blockchain technology has been widely used in the field of financial technology, but it still faces challenges in business, technology, and risk management. In order to better apply blockchain to the field of supply chain finance (SCF), this article starts from the status quo of SCF. Research and analyze industry pain points in traditional supply chain financing, and propose the application superiority of blockchain in SCF. At the same time, government agencies should actively adjust regulatory strategies to find a regulatory method suitable for the country’s development. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Computer network security (NS) is the most concerned problem of society and people. With the increasing amount of network information, the computer NS management in the era of Big Data (BD) is very important, and has become the primary topic of NS management. This paper studies the computer NS and preventive measures based on BD technology. In this paper, through the method of literature analysis and questionnaire survey, 150 teachers and students majoring in Computer Science in our school were investigated to understand the current situation of computer NS in China and the solutions. The research results show that the computer NS problems in the era of BD are mainly divided into three aspects: the security problems caused by human factors account for about 30%, the security problems in data transmission account for about 45%, and the security problems of computers themselves account for about 25%. In view of these NS problems, this paper details the NS problems, and proposes corresponding solutions to these problems, so as to effectively improve the level of NS management and promote the efficient development of computer network technology(NT). © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This study presents a new model to mitigate the cyber threats of the impending Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) using the security features of blockchain technology. The initiatives of regional aviation authorities to upgrade the ATM system have common surveillance and data sharing equipment named ADS-B which is unencrypted. The cybersecurity threat to aviation operations has become more challenging with the up-gradation of ATM which largely depends on ADS-B. Today, the global civil aviation authorities are relying on the data-Link and IT systems for their day-to-day ATM through ADS-B and other Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS). Numerous studies and aviation enthusiasts expressed the vulnerability of the ADS-B due to unencrypted data sharing of ATCS. In this research, a blockchain framework is proposed to address the current security-related weaknesses of the ADS-B application and other data-Linked services of impending ATM. This blockchain model is designed based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform which ensures privacy, confidentiality, and origin/destination authenticity to overcome the cybersecurity threat of ADS-B and other ATCS support systems. This proposed model is significant as it leverages the synergy of multi-agent networks and approved blockchain technology like Hyperledger Fabric for a secure, stable, and unified network for collaboration. Thus, the different risks of upcoming ADS-B based ATM-like eavesdropping, message modification, injection, deletion can be combated using this proposed model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The Information Technologies Directorate of the Micaela Bastidas de Apurímac National University (UNAMBA) (UNAMBA Rationalization Office, «Organization and Functions Manual,» Abancay, 2018.), is in charge of managing the technologies and information; it also has to safeguard the computer assets under its responsibility. However, it does not have any plan, standard, or directive that allows correctly protecting the information. For this reason, our research aimed to contribute to improving the level of information security in the Information Technology Directorate (DTI) of UNAMBA, implementing the Information Security Management System based on the standard ISO/IEC 27001: 2013 (ISO 27001 - ISO 27001 Management Systems Software, «ISO Software,» 2018. [Online]. Available: https://www.isotools.org/normas/riesgos-y-seguridad/iso-27001/. [Last access: July 21, 2018].). This standard allows the assurance of the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information and information systems. Regarding the research methodology, the type of research is applied with a pre-experimental research design. As a methodology for the design of the Information Security Management System, the Deming PDCA method («PDCA Cycle (Plan, Do, Check and Act): Deming's circle of continuous improvement | PDCA Home,» Pdcahome.com, 2018. [Online]. Available: https://www.pdcahome.com/5202/ciclo-pdca/. [Last access: July 25, 2018].) (Plan, Do, Check, Act) was used, which consists of identifying the computer assets, performing the analysis and risk management, to then establish response actions (controls) and mitigate the associated risks. Also, carry out information security policies. For the analysis and risk management, the MAGERIT III methodology (General Directorate for Administrative Modernization, Procedures and Promotion of Electronic Administration, MAGERIT - version 3.0. Information Systems Risk Analysis and Management Methodology., Madrid: Ministry of Finance and Public Administrations, 2012.) was used. The sample is n = 20 people. As results, it was obtained that the level of security risks before the implementation of the controls was 86.15%, to obtain 11.15% later; therefore, there was a decrease of 75%. Likewise, there was an increase in security controls, since before carrying out the risk treatment plan, only 18 (15.78%) controls were obtained, but then it was increased to 65 (57.01%) controls, representing an increase of 41.23%. Also, there was an improvement in the level of training in information security issues in DTI users because, before the implementation of the ISMS, only 48% of the respondents had knowledge about information security, but then it rose to 95%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Considering the overall situations of cultivator’s economic degradation, food safety chain issue, and whole food supply chain, newer technologies are emerging in the field of agriculture over time. If we look at third world countries, these traditional food supply chains still play the main bearish down prediction. For the result, if any customer deceived by adulterated foods, then in most cases, he/she could not get the original source of the food where it was produced or processed. And in this case, also the administration cannot make this possible to identify and punish the fraudsters. This is where the fraudsters get the opportunity to mix adulteration in foods, put new expiration on expired foods, and release them in the market. Again because of the lack of efficient distribution facilities between cultivators and industrial or last stage vendors, most of the cases cultivators could not get fair pay. And to solve this problem and set explicit or trustworthy communications, the civilization needed immutable and trustworthy technology so that all these problems can be solved. And in that stage, blockchain comes to the picture. In this research paper, we propose an effective, efficient, and satisfactory model or system and service solution to agro traders and also a food traceability system based on blockchain and the help of IoT to make their business more smart and rich. And through the blockchain, smart contract, and the help of IoT sensors, we tried to do maximum effort to reduce human intervention. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The relevance of the human factor (HF) reliability management is substantiated due to the reliable prediction of a possible change in the functional and psycho-emotional state (PES) of operators for controlling potentially hazardous objects (PHO). It is shown that PES modeling based on digital behavioral models (DBM) is a modern tool for such forecasting. Personalization of the DBM is carried out by taking into account individual bioparameters, which are registered, as a rule, using remote non-contact biometric technologies. The low reliability of the forecast in the event of emergency situations is highlighted as the main drawback of the existing DBMs. The main reason is the lack of reliability of the registration of bioparameters when using one or a limited number of biometric technologies. The relevance of the development of an expandable DBM, which allows to eliminate the indicated drawback, has been substantiated. The study proposes an expandable DBM that allows you to expand the range of processed biometric data. At the same time, it becomes possible to integrate biometric data obtained using remote non-contact technologies with data obtained using wearable biometric devices, such as, for example, bracelets. The developed DBM makes it possible, simultaneously with the implementation of the forecast, to monitor the health status of PHO personnel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In accordance with the FATF Recommendations of 2012, countries and their financial units are to manage Money Laundering/Counter Terrorism Financing risk (hereinafter – ML/CTF risk). Such a process consists of the following main steps: risk identification, assessment and mitigation. Besides the document supervises the requirements regarding the efficient use of financial monitoring resources. Commercial banks often face the problem of inadequate identification and assessment due to the lack of true and undistorted information about their clients. For the first, financial monitoring services are considered to be non-profitable in accordance with bank management. As a rule, resources of financial monitoring in commercial banks are rather limited to buy data bases containing identification information about physical and juridical bodies. For the second, sometimes financial institutions (commercial banks in particular) don’t manage to collect enough information about new client without any financial history (for example start-ups or individuals who just open banking accounts for the first time). As a result, lack of information resources affects the quality of ML/CTF risk assessment. The article is devoted to the ways of such problems solution with the use of contemporary IT – systems and technologies. Automatization of these procedures will lead to a significant growth of financial monitoring efficiency in commercial banks and other financial institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={As Internet of Things (IoT) advances from interacting objects to smart objects. Further, adopting social networking concepts into IoT leads to social objects. Following this conception, the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) comprising the amalgamation of social aspects into IoT was incised. In the recent past, the use of IoT technologies in the industrial sectors and applications has given birth to a new research area termed as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) which has attained notable attention extensively. In machinery-based industries, elements such as bearings, axles, brackets, hangers, etc., are the essential machine element that serves a variety of purposes in the production environment. Thus, any severity related to it causing failure is unfavorable. This paper introduces the SIoT concept into the manufacturing industry for predicting the failure of the machine element before it could occur. This work proposes the construction of the ontological model that assists in the implementation of the prognostics and health management to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machine element, which is essential in minimizing maintenance cost and machine downtime, and further limiting disasters. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Cloud computing is an unparalleled innovation in the field of computer science. However, the CSPs cannot be entrusted with secret data. Data needs to be encrypted before it is uploaded to the cloud. But again, the data is only as secure as the keys used to encrypt or decrypt it. This gives rise to yet another problem, i.e., key management. This paper systematically reviews the literature, identifies the issues prevalent in key management, and presents their corresponding solutions. Post the literature review, we propose a model that borrows the best from the past efforts and fixes the shortcomings of the present models by combining all the solutions presented in this paper. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The paper considers approaches to ontologies using in task of requirements tracing. It is stated that for successful requirements management it is necessary to reveal the image of rational activity object, not its individual properties. In this approach requirement is defined as an aspect projection of some object ontology onto considered subject area in the system purpose context. A model of the activity object ontology, as a system of functionally and logically interrelated concepts, quantities and methods, is developed. Proposed model combines an ontology of quantities and measures and an ontology of means, “technologies” of assessment. Such model makes it possible to describe processes occurring in the system in more detail, and in combination with other ontologies (ontology of an activity life cycle stages, properties ontology, certain project ontology constructed by project documentation), it allows to obtain tools for more efficient requirements revealing, understanding of causal relationship in their changing and management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={At present, the market for information protection tools (IPTs) is much wider than a couple of years ago. But not only technology protects and carries a threat. People are still at the forefront as the most common cause of errors is the lack of experience and low competency. The only right solution is the creation of cyber polygons as specially equipped and controlled network infrastructures for developing practical skills to combat information security (IS) threats. The National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute) could not remain aloof from this process as the leading institute for IS training in Russia. Therefore, it was decided to create such a cyber polygon within the framework of the educational and research Network Security Intelligence Center (NSIC) for intelligent network security management established at the MEPhI Institute of Cyber Intelligence Systems in 2016. The paper describes the first results achieved in making this project a reality. It introduces the “Cyber Polygon” term, briefly analyzes a state of the current cyber polygons development worldwide, and introduces the MEPhI Cyber Polygon objectives and provision to be used within the framework of the “Business Continuity and Information Security Maintenance” Master’s degree programme. Further activities in its development conclude the paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Blockchain technology finds variety of applications in everyday life. It is also capable of disrupting the implications on activities which were founded on time-stamped record keeping of titles of ownership. In education, blockchain technology shall disrupt activities such as the qualifications, licensing and accreditation, management of student records, IPR management and payments. Hence, blockchain technology-based products or services are significantly different from previous Internet-based commercial developments. Also blockchain is catching up interest in the education sector. However, the stakeholders within education are largely unaware of the social advantages and potential of blockchain technology. Within the educational sphere, the adoption of blockchain technology in the replacement of paper-based assessments has both advantages and challenges. This paper attempts to explore the challenges faced by faculty and graduate students in the adoption of digitized assessments and technical issues in achieving secured system. By identifying the challenges in implementation, it will be easy to achieve successful adoption of digitized assessments in a large scale. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Currently, emerging technologies such as the internet of things, big data, cloud computing, allow society to create intelligent environments. Intelligent environments are based on the interaction of people with technology directly without the need for intermediary devices such as servers or computers. A sample of this is the smart campuses where there is a large concentration of people who develop different activities consume many resources. The objective of emerging technologies is to facilitate the development of these activities in sustainable environments where good management of resources is prioritized and lived in harmony with nature. However, companies that offer these technologies with the aim of taking advantage of the sale of devices, forget something as important as information security. Smart campuses use this technology as the main component in their architectures for data acquisition. This becomes a problem when the security of the devices is poor because they can become a gateway to cybercriminals. This work proposes an architecture that improves the security of the network of an intelligent campus that relies on the internet of things for its administrative and academic management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Currently, global competition, technological development and innvtion represent a challenge for companies, above all for manufacturing, as they are forced to reconfigure their processes for the growing market of personalized products. Industry 4.0 and manufacturing generate a transformation, and both manufacturing and information technologies have been integrated to create efficient systems of production, management and ways of doing business. The objective of the research is to analyze the influence of technological tools oriented to Industry 4.0 in the increase of the flexibility of a manufacturing system ap-plied, implementing vertical and horizontal integration systems, data analysis, cloud and simulation in production systems modular for obtaining data. The flexibility reached was determined according to the parameters of a flexible manufacturing system: variety of parts, programming change, error recovery and new parts, allowing to automate the manufacturing processes, as well as to attend in a timely manner the needs of the market, promoting the growth of the national industry in concepts of flexibility and Industry 4.0 applied. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The management of natural resources has multiple challenges, such as covering the needs of a population that is estimated to exceed nine billion people by 2050, Therefore, the need for a digital evolution in agriculture that meets the needs of a world population in the future is identified The objective was: evaluate the sustainability of natural resources as a contribution towards the technological innovation of agriculture; the snowball sampling technique was used, in four productive systems: mixed, agroecological, indigenous y conventional, located in the transition and buffer zones of the Choco Andino Biosphere Reserve, SAFA evaluation framework (FAO) was used. The data were collected through a semistructured interview based on a questionnaire of 117 questions; the interview lasted 75–85 min conducted to the heads of household In the results were evidence of the 12 case of studies and the different sustainability dynamics in the dimensions: good governance, economic residence, environmental integrity and social welfare. The similar characteristic between case studies was the precarious capacity to govern natural resources, which strengthens the importance of intervention with a digital literacy process to improve management capacity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The proliferation of information and communication technologies in all spheres of society, and especially in the area of education, has posed major challenges for developing countries. Bridging the gap in access to ICTs between different strata of society has become a constant task at all levels. The objective of this paper is to analyze the digital divide that exists between students and teachers in Ecuador’s university institutions. The research was of an exploratory type, with a field design. A questionnaire was applied to a sample of 133 teachers and 906 students from a universe of 1654 people, selected through a stratified probabilistic sampling. The result of the exploration carried out allowed to point out the findings from a descriptive investigation, supported, equally, in background and theoretical references. The results show an initial reduction of the gap in the use of basic technological tools and the need to continue deepening in the use of new more complex technologies such as Academic ERPs, as a management and integration core of good ICT practices to achieve a comprehensive and harmonious development between the teaching - learning and academic - administrative processes, in order to alleviate the computer deficiencies that are still apparent in institutional controls, and thus ensure that good practices are adopted by higher education institutions to guarantee their comprehensive development for the benefit of education and the society in which they are immersed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Currently, universities base all their efforts on improving student learning. To achieve this, they improve their educational methods and work in training the teaching staff in new techniques that transform traditional learning into active learning. Active learning seeks to make the student the main actor of his own education, with this, the student is free to learn what he owes and does so in a time appropriate to his needs. This need grows when the evolution of education conforms to online education models. Online education, although presented as an accessible option for all sectors of society has several complications such as high dropout and low learning rates. New technologies act as ideal assistants to solve these problems, because, through an application, they have the ability to interact with people and improve learning processes. Artificial intelligence interacts with users and simulates a person. These tools allow improving management in educational processes. This work aims to apply a Chatbot applied to a learning management system in the online education model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This has as objective: propose a new educational model entirely supported by the called 4.0 technology to achieve ubiquitous learning in the educational institution. Specifically, it deals with the problems related to vocational training, not aimed at achieving competencies for efficient job performance in the future. Also, the conflictive situation is associated with the low level of technological management by teachers as well as total ignorance about technology 4.0. The research was developed among the students, and professors of the University, initially, a theoretical foundation was made related to didactic models, technology 4.0, ubiquitous learning. In the end, a techno-alternative didactic model is proposed, fully supported by 4.0 technology applied through computers, and mobile devices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of the implementation of a web application for the management of reagents of the Faculty of Accounting and Auditing at the Technical University of Ambato, the objective of this application is to provide teachers and staff in charge of academic management a tool for the creation, control, validation and monitoring of reagents, as well as the use of these reagents in the creation of a complex examination instrument as a modality of degree. The web development methodology is based on JavaScript that involves tools that are linked in the MEAN stack (Mongo-Express-Angular-Node), an analysis and use of these 4 technologies will be made together for the creation of a distributed application using the same JavaScript language in all its phases and layers. The results will reflect the implementation of a functional web application with a simple inter-face, which highlights the reliability, security and availability of information. Finally, the conclusions, limitations and future works of the present project are presented. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In Agriculture, the demand for better crops is increasing rapidly and seeks proper management in the development of crop production for a better supply. The principle objective here is to implement the usage of technology, i.e. IoT and sensors to enhance the efficiency of the farming systems by providing farmers with the facility to utilize their time and interests in complete potential. This paper presents a custom-built cost-effective device by utilizing the notion of the MQTT IoT protocol that transfers data through the network systems and collects reports about the soil condition. It takes into consideration several factors that affect the health and living of a plant. These factors include the criteria of pH, temperature and moisture for soil, light availability, air temperature and humidity to take into account the present conditions of the plant. Our IoT device for agriculture enables seamless data collection and availability to cloud even for challenged Internet connection. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the explosion of Internet-based technologies like online examination system, a lot of manual tasks have been automated, thereby saving time and effort. But deployment of such automated system has made the process more vulnerable to various risks, such as confidentiality loss, intrusion of critical data, and impersonation. In this paper, we proposed an online exam system using multi-factor authentication that allows instructors to set exams for different subjects via an integrated high text editor. Students can take exams after code-based verification and biometric authentication. It automates the process of exam scheduling, grading, and reporting, thereby reducing the workload of the instructors. A survey has been conducted to prove the efficacy of the system in terms of reliability, scalability, and availability. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In Ecuador in recent years there has been a strong investment in the field of health, due to the increase of patients and medical specialties, along with a deficit in the handling and distribution of information due to lack of trained staff or little optimization and control of the technological resources, generating problems in the administration and assignment of medical appointments, being the waiting times in activations of medical appointments the main problem. Nowadays, health systems increasingly require more innovative processes that contribute to a better provision of services, being patients and all health center staff the direct and indirect beneficiaries respectively. For that it is necessary to have a centralized service, which allows us to have a friendlier and faster access to the information. Taking in account these scenarios, Information and Communications Technology arise as a way to solve all the previously described aspects and therefore this work has a purpose, which is to design and develop a Progressive Web Application for mobile devices which provides easy access and usability to patients as well as helping to improve the waiting times generated in the activation of medical appointments. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Finding relevant expertise is a critical need in software organizations since developers use it to support their knowledge needs. In software organizations, expertise can be found in architectural knowledge (AK), which incorporates the experience and problem reasoning of human resources through two primary sources: experts and artifacts; consequently, know how to model it, could grant access to the best practices, training practices, and data across applications; this has generated considerable interest by organizations, which seek to develop formal approaches to condensate the available knowledge from different sources in a systematic manner. In this work, we present a semantic knowledge modeling, which was developed using knowledge modeling techniques; the model aims to link artifacts and experts within the organization; moreover, we present ExCap a tool that implements the semantic model presented. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Smart grid has become an important direction for the development of the current power industry, and risk management is an important research content of the smart grid. However, the current solutions to power failure still rely on dispatchers with their knowledge and experience. It is of great significance to construct a knowledge base of power dispatching operation for intelligent decision-making support. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing dispatching operation knowledge based on knowledge graph technology to assist the dispatcher in making decisions when encountering the risk of power failure. We use it to analyze the power dispatching knowledge. By knowledge extraction and building knowledge relationship network, we constructed the knowledge graph of power dispatching operation. It provides knowledge support for intelligent power dispatching systems to assist dispatchers in making decisions when power failures occur. It can help dispatchers reduce workload and various work errors while improving quality and efficiency. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In emergency circumstances, mobile devices are very much helpful to gather the mandatory information in a powerful way. But it has the constraints like lower energy density and reduced computing capability. In order to reduce mobile phone workloads, high power-draining tasks need to be transferred to the cloud. Moreover, the absence of Internet access often renders it really challenging to transfer data to the destination cloud from the root mobile phone. To solve this issue, we propose an Emergency Management System using NSGA-II Optimization Technique which uses peer-to-peer network communication considering Bluetooth technology with Mobile Probing Service (MPS) and Mobile Ranking Service (MRS) for choosing the good smartphone. Also to find the mobile device which has maximized rank and minimized RNL value, the proposed E2M algorithm uses NSGA-II optimization technique. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the comprehensive construction of smart distribution networks, a new generation of IT technologies represented by Internet of Things, cloud computing, and edge computing are widely used. With low data quality and complex data characteristics of smart distribution network, it is urgent to find a reasonable way to solve the massive data problem of cloud computing system explosion. Considering the importance, regionality, difference, and real time of the data, it is proposed to use edge calculation to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and redundancy of the data. The cloud computing capability is sunk to the edge of the network close to the client, running on the edge of the mobile network while performing specific computing tasks. By analyzing the index weights, the evaluation model is built and evaluated. The edge information-based sensing information fusion algorithm of distribution network is studied, and the intelligent distribution network data evaluation system based on multi-dimensional analysis and mining is established. The proposed algorithm provides strong support for the operation and maintenance management and correct decision-making of smart distribution network. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Managing a large number of textual documents is a critical and significant task and supports many applications ranging from information retrieval to clustering search engine results. The multilinguistic facility provided by websites makes Hindi a major language in the digital domain of information technology today. This work focuses on document management through document clustering for a big corpus and summarization of clusters. The objective is to overcome the scalability problem while managing the documents and summarizing the Hindi corpus by extracting tokens. The work is better in terms of scalability and supports the consistent quality of cluster for incremental dataset. Most of the past and contemporary research works have targeted English corpus document management. Hindi corpus has been mostly exploited by the researchers for exploring stemming, single-document summarization, and classifier design. Implementing unsupervised learning on the Hindi corpus for summarization of multiple documents through Word Cloud is still an untouched area. Technically speaking, the current work is an application of TF-IDF, cosine-based document similarity measures, and cluster dendrograms, in addition to various other Natural Language Processing (NLP) activities. Entropy and precision are used to evaluate the experiments carried on different live and available/tested datasets and results prove the robustness of the proposed approach for Hindi Corpus. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the progress of science and technology and the times, the teaching level is constantly innovating. Colleges and universities are also further improving the practical application ability of students. Laboratory construction is an essential link to improve the practical ability of students. This design is mainly based on JSP technology for business logic development, using MySQL database for data storage and call, using hypertext markup language (HTML) to build a web page interface, achieving five management functions, namely system management, appointment record management, teacher and student management, laboratory management and appointment management. The object is teachers and students in Colleges and universities. The traditional laboratory managed by hand is replaced by online reservation laboratory. The test shows that the design of the reservation laboratory system has basically reached the expected goal, and will further expand the system function and improve the browser compatibility in the later stage. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The application of AI in classroom teaching not only creates a vivid simulation situation, but also improves students’ direct “on-site” experience through human-computer interaction, which is helpful for students’ thinking development and deep understanding. But at present, the ability of teachers to use information technology is not satisfactory. Based on the data of CEPS survey, we make a study that uses an analysis of the HLM in two levels to explore factors which influence junior teachers’ use of modern education technology. The research based on the result of a questionnaire of 797 teachers. The result firstly shows that there is a strong relationship between a week’s workload, the pressure of school management, job title, class performance and teachers’ use of modern education technology. Secondly, we find at the school level the better school hardware condition is, the more likely they are to use modern education technology. There is no significant relationship between learning atmosphere and teachers’ use of modern education technology. Thirdly, at the perspective of the regulation of cross level, school hardware condition promotes the relationship between the teachers’ a week’s workload and teachers’ use of modern education technology. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that “socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era”, and China’s economy has changed from a high-speed development to a high-quality development stage. The adjustment of power energy structure and market-oriented reform have been pushed forward in depth. One belt, one road, is the traditional cost management mode. The first is that the traditional power project cost above the budget quota has been unable to meet the needs of the full market competition. Two, the new technologies change rapidly in complex power engineering. At the same time, the overseas electricity market is broader. This puts forward new requirements for the cost management of electric power engineering. At this time, the management based on cost big data will bring more convenience to the cost management. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The all-media is an important manifestation of technological development and conceptual progress in the new era, and plays an important role in the daily learning and life of college students. Various subjects of student funding work have made full use of modern multimedia technologies and methods, and have made many new attempts at improving funding effectiveness and reducing funding risks. Education authorities use data sharing to avoid fair risks, border colleges and universities use real-time multimedia tools to avoid procedural risks, recipients obtain funding information through information platforms to avoid beneficiary risks, and local student credit loan banks strictly abide by loan application procedures to avoid review risks. Through the establishment of a joint risk prevention and control mechanism for funding entities, the establishment of a sound scientific and standardized risk management system, and the strengthening of guidance and education for funding recipients, various measures have been taken to further enhance funding risk prevention capabilities. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the 21st century, with the advent of the training model for young employees based on the “big data profile” and the development of information technology, modern enterprises have brought both opportunities and challenges. To build an excellent modern company, State Grid Yichang Power Supply Company must implement the “people-oriented” and “talent-powered enterprise” management ideas, and strengthen the training of young employees to achieve the healthy growth of new young employees and the common development of the company. This paper uses the “one person, three files” data of young employees to construct an analysis model to portray the “personal portraits” and “organizational portraits” of young employees and experts, and develop software to automatically generate training maps, and build on the basis of training maps. A two-level organization system, implementation of a number of assessment and incentive measures, and preparation of a “training navigation manual” to enhance the control and effectiveness of training management work, and to stimulate the internal driving force of young employees to participate in training. This article studies the “State Grid Yichang Power Supply Company” young staff training plan and implements a new training model, but the purpose is to modify and supplement this basic framework, and finally design a relatively complete training model. Including effective training system, internal training mechanism, triple training incentive mechanism. This article is based on the principle of “being a person first, doing things later”, innovating training methods, extending training time limits, vigorously implementing a professional mentor system, and planning training projects with innovative ideas and methods. Research shows that managers and young employees respectively believe that about 73% and 64% of companies have formulated corresponding training plans before the implementation of training, accounting for the vast majority of the total number of companies. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Over the last decade and a half, economists have sizably grown in number as a class of the users of geospatial technology (GT) and data to innovate, evolve and design new ways of measuring and managing growth. Sensory images from satellites are easily available in public domain, and there has emerged a class of sophisticated remote sensing users in the field of economics. Their growing understanding and application of geospatial technology have revolutionized banking and the economic world. The development is welcome as it goes deeper and enables a renewed look at the growth dynamics to re-energize the global economy particularly when the traditional growth drivers seem exhausted and fading out. However, the data explosion brought in by the surge in geospatial technology will remain largely untapped in the absence of a parallel growth in the art of knowledge management particularly in converting the raw data to useful information and applicable knowledge for its practical use in banking and economic growth. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Due to the advanced modern computers and storage technologies, more and more data are generated and recorded every day. These complex data cover all aspects of student learning, life and management, and are a hidden resource for the school. However, due to the mass data and the intricate information channels, a large amount of data is not taken seriously, which is regarded as "junk" and ignored. The expansion of the scale of universities and the development of information technology pose new challenges to student management, classroom teaching and employment. Using big data in the education field to predict and judge student behavior in a timely manner can provide decision-making assistance for universities in mental health analysis, teaching quality evaluation, and student employment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={VANET is an essential key technology for building up an intelligent transportation system (ITS) that combines current wireless technologies to vehicles. Real-time information sent to driver or vehicle ensures smooth traffic flow in order to ensure safe driving and traffic management while avoiding accidents. To maintain smooth functioning and protection of real-time information from alteration, data must be secured and authenticated. In this paper, a novel anonymous authentication scheme for VANET has been presented which tries to provide strong non-repudiation, anti-forgery, and anonymity properties. Additionally, to avoid vehicles from abusing VANET as well as to provide strong privacy protection, a conditional tracking mechanism for vehicle tracing is developed which revokes certificates of misbehaving vehicles in an efficacious manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol protects the network from attacks such as masquerading, identity theft, and certificate replication. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Power industry is the pillar industry of national economy. GIS has become an indispensable part of power information construction with its unique spatial analysis ability and visual expression ability. The construction goal of power GIS is to improve the visual management level of power equipment, enhance the real-time supervision ability of equipment and lines, realize the integration of the whole network information, and provide decision support for power production and operation. All kinds of traditional GIS applications are based on the data structure of point, line and surface spatial relationship analysis. The GIS services and web applications provided by traditional GIS cannot meet the needs of power professional applications. Based on the study of traditional GIS, a new power GIS platform is designed and developed. This paper proposes a quad tree data index solution based on tile element association, which can reduce the depth of spatial index search tree and significantly accelerate the speed of element retrieval; Research the real-time data push technology and the integrated display technology of data and graph, realize the real-time on-line monitoring of equipment status based on the theme, improve the shortcomings of traditional real-time system in server query pressure, real-time performance can not be guaranteed; research the best i-path algorithm model for emergency repair of faulty equipment, A parallel search algorithm based on region partition is proposed, which has the advantages of simple preprocessing, high concurrency and fast convergence. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the improvement of people’s living standards, traveling has become a common way of leisure. Tourism has gradually become the mainstay of China’s tertiary industry. The amount of daily work information on travel agencies has increased, which brings a certain difficulty to the management of the tourism industry. The combination of tourism and its technology is regarded as a shortcut to success by the tourism industry. However, the similar tourism management software that has been built at this stage is difficult to use, upgrade, and maintain due to its monotonous function and backward software development technology. The application system developed by the SSH integration framework has a clear structure, high development efficiency, and is also convenient for later maintenance and expansion. Therefore, it is a common topic for the tourism and software industry to build a stable and easy to expand tourism management system with an advanced and mature SSH framework. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Engineering industry is one of the important industries in the process of economic development. In the aspect of project investment, how to achieve the expected effect with the minimum investment under the premise of ensuring the project quality has become the topic of common concern of all stakeholders. In view of the difficulty of the traditional project cost control which is not refined and time-consuming, this paper proposes an effective control method of the whole process project cost based on BIM. BIM technology is used to control the cost of the whole process of the project, so as to realize effective management and avoid out of control investment. Through the actual case, the results show that the method presented in this paper has obvious advantages in time consumption and estimation accuracy, and the satisfaction of management personnel, construction personnel and supervision personnel has reached more than 85%. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rise of big data and intelligent manufacturing in recent years, agricultural production in the traditional way of operation has been linked with wisdom gradually. Especially after the rise of the rural revitalization strategy, the key to achieving rural revitalization lies in solving the problems of agriculture, rural areas and farmers. It is inseparable from the intelligent management model and advanced technology to improve the efficiency of agricultural production. It has changed the agricultural production by establishing an intelligent management platform, which can accelerate land transfer and form an intensive agricultural land management model. This paper uses Chinese national panel data from 2002 to 2017 combining quantile regression to examine whether farmland scale can improve production efficiency in the background of smart agriculture. Finally, we will propose relevant policy recommendations based on empirical test results. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The reform of state-own hospital under information age is approaching. All state-owned hospitals will be separated from their parent system through reorganization, restructuring, transferring and centralized management under information age, but there are numerous practical difficulties in this reform under information age. This paper followed up the whole reform process in a medical institution of A Group, summarized practical difficulties in the reform and provided preliminary suggestions for reasonable development of the reform. Practical difficulties in the reform of state-owned hospitals include unclear ownership, backlash among employees and compensation dispute under information age. Integrating internal resources, seizing market opportunities, seeking differentiate development, filling the gap in technology, keeping pace with medical reform and playing a positive role in transformation are reasonable approaches that can improve the reform of state-owned hospitals and provide referential significance for the reform of health system in China under information age. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

With the high rhythm of modern people’s life, the pressure increases, and the quality of sleep is getting lower and lower. However, sleep is closely related to health and should not be ignored. The smart mattresses on the market either have pure detection function and are used in special environment such as medical treatment, or can only achieve the effect of relieving sleep through materials. In the upsurge of smart home, using the technology of Internet of things, we designed a mattress with more intelligent functions, such as detecting sleep quality, having intelligent wake-up service, and realizing intelligent control of app and voice. The smart mattress system mainly has the detection function, wake-up function, and manipulation customization function. The mattress has a detection of human sleep time and state. It can make the user wake up without pressure and reduce the sleepiness through the physical movement of the mattress, improve the efficiency and ensure the health of the biological clock. It can also intelligently control some customizable operations of the mattress through voice and software, such as wake up time, mattress soft and hard, this intelligent mattress has a variety of environment and conditions for sleep needs at the same time, the use of modern mechanical technology, network connection, to achieve many practical functions, pay attention to health management, convenient for human beings, improve the quality of life and sleep quality. In practical application, the technology is more practical and has a certain market prospect. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Using the method of literature research deeply, correctly understand and analyze the problem of the risks in the design and application of artificial intelligence. AI business applications bring convenience to human, but also bring a lot of risk problems to social development. There are risks such as security issues, consumer privacy issues, moral hazard and so on. The causes of risks in AI design and application are incomplete laws and regulations and imperfect the ways of supervision and relief and limitations of artificial intelligence technology and lack of new ethics and morality matching artificial intelligence. The conclusion is that effective risk prevention measures must be taken to prevent risks in time. Safety designs should be strengthened to reduce risk from the source. The supervision and management system of artificial intelligence must be improved to curtail moral hazard. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the increasing demand for automation of production lines, robots are increasingly used in industrial production, making robot production line simulation technology a hot research topic. The virtual test run system of the robot is based on the layout plan of the robot production line to carry out three-dimensional visual simulation of the production line, to verify the rationality of the layout plan, and to avoid unnecessary losses caused by blind production. However, the current research on simulation software is lacking, so the research of robot virtual trial operation system has important significance for domestic industrial development. The purpose of this paper is to use the virtual prototype to solve the problems in the design stage before manufacturing the physical prototype of the stamped product, and contribute to the research of the robotic stamping automation production line. This paper is mainly based on the advantages of high flexibility of robot stamping production line, low mold requirements, simple programming of new workpieces, virtual prototyping technology, computer science and other disciplines, physical simulation, full simulation, and finally the same physical prototype test production method. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 holds tremendous potential to transform the operational productivity of industries. Construction sector of India has fallen behind to embrace Industry 4.0 framework. Delay in project completion and lack of coordination within departments due to unavailability of real-time information hampers the effectiveness of the operations on a daily basis. The investigation of impediments in the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the construction industry of India is an urgent requirement to restore the efficiency of the sector. Based on the extant literature review and discussions with the experts, 25 key challenges were identified. Using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool, fuzzy TOPSIS, which operates with uncertain and vague inputs, the ranking of the challenges was established. Huge costs incurred in the implementation and maintenance emerged as the biggest obstacle followed closely by problems in hiring skilled people with the required expertise. Heavy lay-offs, disruptions in compensation and legal barriers are some other serious issues that hinder adoption of Industry 4.0. Through this paper, key obstacles in the adoption of digital technology are expected to surface up that can inform management and assist in the timely decision making. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of science and technology and the deepening of globalization, the algorithm of CMAC neural network is analyzed. Although the basic CMAC neural network has defects, it is greatly constrained by the training samples during offline training. In the self-learning process, the activation weights are modified without difference, which will cause the output jump change, However, compared with other intelligent algorithms, it has the unique advantages of fast convergence, strong generalization ability and similar input to achieve similar output. With the increasingly fierce competition among enterprises, the politics, economy, society and environment are complex and changeable. The dynamic environment will inevitably affect the business content, organizational form and management mode of enterprises, and then affect the post setting, post division and the work content, work characteristics and job requirements of employees. The dynamic organizational environment requires the enterprise to continuously develop the overall flexibility and the ability to adapt to the dynamic environment, and puts forward the requirements for the work analysis to adapt to the dynamic adjustment. The work analysis results obtained by the traditional work analysis method are only static processing of the work information, and the analysis results cannot be adjusted dynamically. A new work analysis is a huge project, which will waste a lot of time, human, material and financial resources, which makes the human resource management of the enterprise encounter a major problem. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The paper presents the process of creating and evaluating the workability of new measuring devices for the health monitoring of infrastructure projects in Da Nang city by using special sensors, including deformation and cracks observers, tentatively named TUD-v1. All the devices are connected and managed via the Web Server in order to provide a real-time data to users. Through the laboratory checks and test-bed, the results confirmed that the observers and the management system works quite effectively and accurately. Additionally, with the reasonable cost, the new early warning system using Internet of Things (IoTs) in this study can be feasibly applied for various smart construction projects with a better performance but cheaper construction cost. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={For many years, companies have been looking for ways to minimize workers’ exposure to security hazards. One way of doing that is by ensuring that workers are at all working times wearing the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) needed for the assigned task. To this end, in this paper, we present in this work, a real-time PPE compliance control system based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology (RTPPECCS). This system gives the possibility to ensure in real time that all workers present on the worksite are compliant with PPE safety policy. The system was developed while keeping in mind that safety systems are usually not stand-alone systems but come as add-ons that work with other management systems such as warehouse management systems (WMS) and enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, arising from the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, affecting most of countries and territories around the world. The Chinese government had to implement drastic actions, placing Wuhan and nearby cities under quarantine and restricting travel. Pharmaceutical firms, biotech companies and universities were racing to contain the novel coronavirus and develop a treatment. In the battle against the disease outbreak named COVID-19, we could observe many successes of healthcare digitalization. For example, artificial intelligence has been applied for epidemic prediction and vaccine development, while wearable devices have been useful for personal health monitoring. These digital responses also uncover many limitations of existing systems, which affect digital collaborations and the effectiveness of technology deployment. These successes and failures are generally practical lessons for oil and gas (O&G) digitalization, and especially for the time when massive transformations are expected in the coming decade. This paper conducts a systematic review of O&G health risk management against infectious diseases. The analysis utilizes digital responses and evidence in the first stage of the COVID-19 (i.e. January and February) to evaluate the flexibility and resilience of O&G organizations facing epidemic prevention and control. This paper addresses the issue of standardization and alignment in cross-sector collaborations. In addition, some concerns related to data privacy and cybersecurity are investigated in the deployment of wearable health devices. These efforts ensure that digital epidemic management is appropriately implemented in the O&G workplace 4.0, and O&G digitalized systems can receive sufficient supports from different disciplines for future disease outbreaks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The current trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, known as Industry 4.0, has also an impact on engineering education. This has a significant influence on the field of research on information communication technology (ICT) for education. It means that the digitalization of teaching processes requires not only suitable supporting software tools but also a suitable infrastructure for managing the flow and transmission of educational knowledge within this infrastructure (clouds, remote desktops, virtual spaces, personal computers). In this context, the authors aim to fill a gap in universal ICT support for teaching, and the state of the art in ICT in general. This gap involves reassessing the actual issues in modern education technology and applications, and requires a more universal approach, because global software or cloud and Web services are not automatically suitable solutions for use in personalized teaching situations where the key players are teachers, i.e. individuals. An approach (also supported within the international research Consortium V4+ACARDC), is illustrated by examples such as testing clouds (cloud content management), virtual spaces, and the development of educational packages and supporting software for visually impaired people. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The problem based on the findings of the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) on licensing performance checks at the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (KOMINFO) is that the certification data of telecommunication tools and equipment in the e-certification information system database is incomplete, inaccurate, and invalid in supporting equipment and equipment certification services telecommunication. Based on these conditions, the level of maturity of data quality management is measured. The measurement of the level of maturity of data quality management is carried out using the Modelo Alarcos de Mejora de Datos (MAMD) 2.0 framework. The result of measurement data quality maturity level is level 1, while the expected level is level 2. The strategy to improve the quality of certification data for telecommunication tools and equipment is prepared based on an analysis of the causes of data problems, gaps in the current condition of quality data management and expectations, and regulations related to data governance. The recommendations produced are grouped into eight data discipline points that need to be implemented by the Directorate of Standardization agreeing to reach the desired level of data quality management maturity. Eight points of data discipline are data requirements management, technology infrastructure management, configuration management, historical data management, data security management, data quality control and control, data life cycle management, as well as standard resolutions, policies, and procedures. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In industrial sectors, the supply chain management (SCM) systems have been getting smarter by accepting and deploying of evolutionarily advanced technologies, for example, the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT made a supply chain more efficient than ever before; IoT analytical tools enable the organizations to manage and react to all important issues and events of the supply chain in well and decent ways. However, the increasingly high demands and complex structure of supply chain systems, including the growing number of participants and operations, are the main concerns to managing the business effectiveness. IoT is a solution to this problem. IoT uses its smart technologies to manage and trigger the supply chain events and operations, and therefore enables an effective supply chain delivery; however, to keep privacy and security in complex, a scaled structure of the supply chain is a challenge for IoT centralized platform. This paper indents to deploy a proof of concept, end-to-end supply chain management (E2ESCM) system for asset delivery (i.e., food products), employing the combined features of IoT and Blockchain. With IoT-Blockchain, we can surely develop and later examine the end-to-end product delivery; IoT devices are used to get instant information, and Blockchain is used to record every transaction occurs in supply ecosystem onto its secure ledger system; the record is always immutable, and participants participating into a distributed network are authorized to maintain record onto a ledger. Therefore, employing IoT-Blockchain, the study examines a significant level of security, traceability, and transparency among participants within the supply chain ecosystem. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The advances of 5G, sensors, and information technologies enabled proliferation of smart pervasive sensor networks. 5G mobile networks provide low-power, high-availability, high density, and high-throughput data capturing by sensor networks and continuous streaming of multiple measured variables. Rapid progress in sensors that can measure vital signs, advances in the management of medical knowledge, and improvement of algorithms for decision support, are fueling a technological disruption to health monitoring. The increase in size and complexity of wireless sensor networks and expansion into multiple areas of health monitoring creates challenges for system design and software engineering practices. In this paper, we highlight some of the key software engineering and data-processing issues, along with addressing emerging ethical issues of data management. The challenges associated with ensuring high dependability of sensor network systems can be addressed by metamorphic testing. The proposed conceptual solution combines data streaming, filtering, cross-calibration, use of medical knowledge for system operation and data interpretation, and IoT-based calibration using certified linked diagnostic devices. Integration of blockchain technologies and artificial intelligence offers a solution to the increasing needs for higher accuracy of measurements of vital signs, high-quality decision-making, and dependability, including key medical and ethical requirements of safety and security of the data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Wireless presentation system (WPS) is a video capturing and streaming device which enables users to wirelessly cast content from user devices such as PC and smartphone onto a larger display device with screen mirroring technology. This technology is applicable to any collaborative environment which includes meeting rooms, conference rooms and even classrooms. However, it is not designed to serve large number of users such as in auditorium and lecture hall, particularly for distributing the projected content to hundreds of audiences. In this paper, we describe an enhanced WPS (eWPS) which extends the functionality of a WPS with a content sharing and distribution capability. Performance results showed that serving a page of presentation content took an average of 1.74 ms with an audience size of 125. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Rapid development of wireless technology and Internet of things (IoT) has indirectly promoted the development of Internet of vehicles (IoV). The data collected by the sensors equipped on the vehicles become richer and more detailed. However, most data are sensitive and private which is relevant to the privacy of the driver and the core information of the system. To protect the data from unauthorized access, fine-grained access control must be enforced. Due to the centralized and complicated access management, traditional access control mechanisms are unfit for IoV systems. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based access control scheme for blockchain-enabled IoV systems. A new type of transaction has been designed to represent the authorization of attributes. The proposed scheme could simplify the access management, and effectively prevent the systems from single point of failure and data tampering. We also improve the access control part to decrease its computation overhead for resource-constrained members in the IoV systems. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can resist various attacks and the performance analysis shows our scheme can be implemented efficiently. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Vehicle tracking systems are a versatile technology which enables commuters to determine the location of the buses in real-time. Bus operators can also deploy it for fleet management purposes. In this work, an integrated, embedded GPS-GSM vehicle tracking system is designed and implemented. The application enables passengers to view the location of bus shuttles in real-time. It also allows bus managers to ascertain the driver behaviour and observe the past and present locations of the bus shuttle. The system has been designed to provide more functionalities with some modifications and additional hardware, such as Accident detection, Fire detection systems and Fuel monitoring. The location of buses can be accessed by the users either using the SMS request option or logging into the mobile application developed for this purpose. Upon receipt of a location request, the tracking system sends feedback which includes both the latitude and longitude coordinates of the vehicle and also a link that enables the display of the bus location of a google map. The location is also logged onto a server managed by the bus operators to monitor the bus activities. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With increase in pollution level, the need of proper management of garbage is also increasing rapidly. In current scenario enormous amount of garbage/waste generated every day, which require proper dumping of waste and recycling of it. The improper disposal of waste leads to numerous health related disease. Although agencies try hard to collect waste from all areas, still they lack in it. One major reason behind this is the inaccurate tracking of areas with garbage. Agencies are using traditional methodologies for assessment and tracking of areas which need to be upgraded by using current technologies. In this paper we propose a machine learning based framework to classify the areas which are free from garbage and areas with having high density garbage. In our approach we have used four different algorithms and achieved the accuracy of 98.6% with kNN and Naïve Bayes, 85.4% with Decision Tree and 98.4% with Random Forest. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Selecting a NewSQL database product is an important process. Like any other successful database management system technology, the product selected today begins to define the legacy of the future. There are many different parameters that can be used to evaluate the NewSQL database alternatives, and there is no single most-correct process for conducting such an evaluation. Not only are there many possible pertinent evaluation criteria, but there also is typically a degree of uncertainty about the requirements and characteristics of the intended application environment. This paper focuses on three NewSQL databases (viz., VoltDB, MemSQL and NuoDB), with emphasis on evaluating their performance. The evaluation is done based on Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With recent viruses across the world affecting millions and millions of people, the self-healthcare information systems show an important role in helping individuals to understand the risks, self-assessment, and self-educating to avoid being affected. In addition, self-healthcare information systems can perform more interactive tasks to effectively assist the treatment process and health condition management. Currently, the technologies used in such kind of systems are mostly based on text crawling from website resources such as text-searching and blog-based crowdsourcing applications. In this research paper, we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework to support interactive and causality reasoning for a Chatbot application. The Chatbot will interact with the user to provide self-healthcare education and self-assessment (condition prediction). The framework is a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Graph (KG) technologies with added causality and probability (uncertainty) properties to original Description Logic. This novel framework can generate causal knowledge probability neural networks to perform question answering and condition prediction tasks. The experimental results from a prototype showed strong positive feedback. The paper also identified remaining limitations and future research directions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Deloitte Insight defines that the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era mainly consists of four domains, namely big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), automation/robotics and the Internet of things (IoT). This research presents one application of IoT system toward automating students’ class attendance capturing, while embedding it with the university’s Total Campus Information System. In university class environment, capturing students’ attendance is one of the fundamental factors in assessing overall student performance. Currently, with new trend of the IoT and the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0), the application of class attendance system, namely e-Class system, is used in ensuring that students attend classes consistently, as well as keeping track of student academic performance. This newly automated QR code-based system is eliminating the time wasted to find a student name, signing and mistakenly signaturing at a wrong name. The development of the system comprises the Student Management Academic Performance (SMAP) online platform, Total Campus Information System (TCIS) and QR code as the newly developed interface for student login into class attendance using the school intranet. The objective of this paper is to improve the processes of capturing students’ attendance in class, promote systematic and more organized attendance recording and enhance the requirement of attendance compliance of the university academic guideline in which requiring 80% attendance. One significant impact of this e-Class system, compliance to class attendance has been found to be positively significant, students becoming more alert on their attendances and rate of attendance has been pushed to high level of 96%. The university top management has decided that the system has to be implemented across all teaching faculties in two of its main campuses due to its seamless approach, relatively low cost and compatibility with the existing technology. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In their quest for sustainability, cities design and deploy smart mobility solutions aiming to improve the efficiency and management of transportation systems and to provide better services to citizens. Those solutions are often based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and on digital services, but their maintenance and management are a greater challenge than their implementation. Problems can be difficult to identify since they can be exogenous or endogenous to the service provider. Usually, in their effort to maintain good service levels, companies implement complex and expensive information systems that use sensors to monitor infrastructure and hardware but ignore other sources of valuable information. In a digitalized world, customers easily report problems that are a cause of lower quality of service and worse user experience. However, for several reasons, service providers do not always pay due attention to these complaints. As communication channels are already open, we claim that customer participation through these reports can be used to significantly enhance the delivery and quality of mobility services. In this work we propose a methodology that takes advantage of customers’ participation in the maintenance and management of smart city solutions. With this methodology, we aim to redesign the process of customer interaction with service providers in order to improve the overall efficiency and the service experience. Our research is based on a case study from a public transport service in the metropolitan area of Porto, in Portugal. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the year 2014, “smart cities” in India started through an initiative known as “Smart Cities Mission” by the Indian Government. The key idea behind this mission is to develop technology-driven cities in India. The urbanization rate in India is rapidly increasing. Due to fast urban growth, citizens suffer from problems like heavy traffic jams, poor waste management, inadequate water supply and many more. To overcome these issues, smart city terminology comes into existence. This paper provides the inclusive improvement of smart cities in India, in terms of market scale, development growth and industry standards. The challenges while making the “smart cities” in India are also discussed. The research also reviews the main themes constituents of the “smart cities” like “smart governance”, “smart education”, “smart living”, “smart healthcare”, “smart citizens”. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Cloud computing has become another age innovation that has colossal possibilities in undertakings and markets. Clouds can make it conceivable to get to applications and related information from anyplace. Organizations can lease resources from cloud for capacity and other computational purposes with the goal that their foundation cost can be diminished fundamentally. Further they can utilize expansive access to applications, in light of pay-more only as costs arise model. Henceforth, there is no requirement for getting licenses for singular items. Be that as it may, one of the significant traps in cloud computing is identified with upgrading the resources being dispensed. In view of the uniqueness of the model, resource allocation is performed with the goal of limiting the expenses related with it. Different difficulties of resource allocation are satisfying client needs and application necessities. In this paper, an optimization-based energy aware resource allocation is proposed for the allotting the resources in an improved way.

abstract={As urban transport technology accelerates, various novel modes of electric-assisted personal transportation are emerging. These create both opportunities and constraints for transportation engineers and urban designers. Our research suggests that it is becoming increasingly clear that traditional road designs and public transportation infrastructures are struggling to accommodate the challenges. Micromobility (MM), including e-bikes, e-scooters, e-skateboards, Segways and hoverboards, is becoming more popular and acceptable by people in the urban environment. Benefits include portability, ease of use, and affordability through shared services. Yet questions abound: How can the increased presence of MM be part of the necessary mixed streaming on urban streets? How can existing infrastructure and spatial allocations be more accommodating of MM, while not unduly disadvantaging other transport forms? Using a case study from the core of Washington, DC, we model the possibilities for adaptable road features that might be implemented for MM based on different traffic loads and infrastructure configurations. We conclude with a brief examination of how micromobility accommodation is poised to leverage urban transformation more broadly, including as it relates to sustainable green infrastructure and stormwater management opportunities. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The rapid expansion of technology and architecture has improved our lives while increasing the traffic hazards, vehicular robberies, and road accidents, which in turn cause a tremendous death toll and property because of poor crisis facilities. As per the government demonstration, everybody ought to observe the traffic rules on the off chance that an individual disrupts any guidelines, at that point the approved individual will charge the fine (Inigo in IEEE Trans Veh Technol 38(3):112–122, [1]). As thefts increasing day today, to control this problem, the security of the system should be increased. If the car is stolen, the owner is allowed to stop ignition via GSM network communications by sending a ‘stop’ message. Then, the parked position can be easily identified by using the methods of the global positioning system. When an accident happens, the family members, friends, nearby police station, and hospitals also will get the notification, along with the location where it happens (Lotufo and Morgan inAutomatic numberplate recognition (6):1–6, [2]). After that, the location of an incident can be easily identified using the GSM network and the global positioning system (GPS) technique (Collins et al. in A system for video surveillance and monitoring. Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie, [3, Dickinson and Wan in Road traffic monitoring using the trip system, pp. 56–60,4]). We use ARM 7 for this technology as the centerpiece of our new smart vehicle tracking system with types of equipment like RFID, GPS, and GSM. The equipment/programming co-structure of another smart vehicle tracking framework incorporates automatic billing, RFID identification, programmed accident detection, and GPS location. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In general, everyone involved with the telecommunications sector has reached a consensus that the Radio Access Network of existing 4G mobile networks will not be able to reach the volume of traffic and quality of service required for the 5G networks that are to come. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the migration process from the current scenario to 5G is carried out efficiently, eliminating operational limitations and guaranteeing interoperability between the reused infrastructure and the new technology to be implemented. This paper describes the process to be followed for an efficient migration from a 4G LTE to 5G CRAN cellular mobile network, utilizing the Public Telecommunications Company of Ecuador – CNT, as a case study. The proposal is based on the repurposing of the existing transport infrastructure, both for backhaul and fronthaul, and the incorporation of a virtualized and centralized Radio Access Network in the Cloud, which allows for optimal resource management, data processing and response times. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The massive growth in the number of electronic circuits, their miniaturization, and the possibility of integrating them into integral systems has created many options for creating smart lighting. Smart lighting can save energy costs in homes, streets, and even public places. Thus, a general trend for the automation of homes called “smart homes" for builders and homeowners is noticed everywhere. In this article, we present the development of a lighting system as a prototype to offer the possibility of controlling the lighting of a whole residential building with a single button, a home of any kind up to approximately 1000 square metres to provide energy efficiency management, security, communication, and comfort services. Our prototype employs a control technology based on the creation of scenes and comfortable environments, which consists of integrating and managing all the elements of a residence to activate or deactivate them, discriminately, through a single instruction triggered from a lighting software with a friendly and intuitive interface. The user interface of the system allows reprogramming the central processing unit of the domotic system, according to the user’s requirements, as is shown in its evaluation. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Scientific production is a key issue in the assessment of universities’ research. Due to the information overload in the publishing domain, it is increasingly difficult for experts, and decision-makers to find relevant information to carry out their research or management tasks. To address this problem, Knowledge Graphs are used to explore and connect publishing sources by increasing their value. In this paper, the authors propose a process to construct a scientific knowledge graph based-on publications’ metadata. A case study implemented in a given university is explained. Finally, some visual representations are created from results returned by SPARQL queries. Thus, people will find relationships and patterns underlying scholarly production. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

There are countless manufacturing companies, of which very few have invested in technology and methodologies, so they have not been able to prepare themselves to advance at the same pace as the industrial revolution. This research proposes to include improvements in the manufacture of furniture by applying software tools and methodologies such as DMAIC, which consists of combining the application of some tools such as Lean, visual management, and standardized work. As a case study, we applied to the manufacture of furniture; the results indicated that by applying DMAIC and simulation tools, a significant increase in production was achieved, with a decrease in delivery time, in addition to the optimization and reduction of waste. This research can serve as a reference for future studies related to manufacturing processes when applying DMAIC, Lean Manufacturing, and simulation software. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid development of modern network technology, business traffic in the network is exploding, and network traffic control technology is facing greater challenges. Traditional network flow control methods often cannot calmly deal with complex and dynamic network states, and it is difficult to avoid network congestion. Therefore, we need an intelligent method that can update flow control decisions according to the current network state. Software defined network (SDN) has brought new ideas for controlling network traffic. In the SDN network architecture, the controller of the control plane can send the network routing policy to manage the traffic forwarding in the data plane layer, so as to implement network management and resource scheduling. The programmability of SDN also provides the possibility of implementing flow control algorithms. By combining SDN and reinforcement learning (RL), a good traffic forwarding policy can be obtained, and the problem of traffic control can be solved effectively. In order to achieve intelligent control of network traffic, this paper introduced the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm in RL. With the goal of maximizing network performance, we designed and implemented a network flow control algorithm based on DDPG. We trained the model, and finally verified the effectiveness and superiority of the flow control method based on DDPG through simulation experiments. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={As the value of the big data is revealed, the problem of security prevention and control of customer service data is highlighted. Once the leakage of sensitive customer information will cause serious legal consequences. At present, State Grid Corporation has effectively resisted the risk of data collection, storage, and transmission through internal and external network isolation and data encryption. However, at the data application level, due to frequent data sharing and business collaboration, new risks of leakage continue to emerge in data mining, data interaction between systems, terminal data access, etc. This article first analyzes the risks faced by data security in terminal data access, cross-domain data transfer, and open data sharing. Then, it proposes terminal data access behavior management and control technology, data cross-domain transfer security interaction technology, and data differentiated privacy protection technology in open sharing. Finally, t on the basis of technical research, the core equipment of data protection was developed and tested, and verified the effectiveness of the technology in practice. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid development of information technology, the Power grid Internet of Things technology has been integrated into all aspects of life. The intelligent network formed by the Power grid Internet of Things that interconnects people, things and things has greatly promoted the intelligent development in various fields. However, due to the large number of IoT devices and the limited resources of many devices, it has brought huge challenges to the protection of IoT information data and device management. This paper proposes a lightweight and secure IoT authentication key agreement protocol for the problems in the IoT environment. The protocol adds identity authentication based on the ECDH algorithm to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The identity authentication part is designed based on the dynamic password technology with hash as the main operation, and realizes the mutual authentication of the dynamic password based on the identification. The entire protocol has good security and can effectively resist man-in-the-middle, impersonation, eavesdropping, and replay attacks, ensuring the security of IoT device communications. At the same time, the protocol resource overhead is small, and it can adapt to resource-limited IoT devices. In addition, the authentication mechanism combined with cloud-edge-end collaboration can efficiently manage many IoT devices. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid development of power grid, the types of power services are becoming more and more diversified, resulting in different service demands. As one of the important technologies of 5G, network slice is used to accommodate different services on the same physical network. After a brief analysis of smart grid background, this paper makes a deep research on the network slice. Each service in smart grid has its own requirements of bandwidth, reliability and delay tolerance. In order to ensure the QoS of Smart Grid, a dynamic optimization scheme of network slicing resources based on reinforcement learning is proposed. This algorithm adjusts the network slice resource dynamically, we can predict the traffic by considering the change of traffic in future network slice, and then deduce the partition of network resource in the future. The reinforcement learning algorithm is then used to make the state of network resource partitioning at future moments influence the current partitioning policy to get the best current policy. Based on this algorithm, the fast response to the change of network demand can be guaranteed in the process of resource allocation, and it is verified by simulation. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={At present, the research of the power lithium battery management system which was applied to the underwater robot is still in the initial stage. The lithium battery management has become one of the main contents of the development of the underwater robot technology. When the use time of rechargeable battery is short, various factors will reduce the life of the battery. Due to the problem of materials, the price of the battery is limited. Effective management of lithium battery can improve the use efficiency of the battery. In addition, the safe and effective use of electricity has great significance for the energy of the pool, which can extend the battery life and improve the reliability of the battery. The main functions of the battery management system were introduced in this paper.

abstract={Banking sector is facing a watershed with the problem of huge NPAs being tackled with various measures such as IPB, Recapitalization to name a few. Credit monitoring is indispensable to protect the lenders’ investment. An effective monitoring system will protect and identify the loans which are to be red-flagged. The resources of the bank manager to monitor the loans are limited. The parameters for such surveillance are many. Some of them are available to the banker through systems in place, while some others have to be instituted with the networking capabilities and oversight of transactions of borrowers. With thousands of loans at various stages of fulfillment, it would be a herculean and cumbersome task for the conventional RDBMS and SQL systems to segregate the loans into categories that require better attention and follow-up. This paper aims to present the possibilities with the banking managers to make use of the advancements and also proposes Tranquil-ART1NN approach using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to give advanced signals to bank officers regarding NPAs/Special Mention Accounts. Tranquil algorithm is meant for the identification of an initial better neighborhood and the Intelligent Huddle Creation algorithm is meant for creating clusters of borrowers based on their performance. The clusters of borrowers are trained using ART1NN approach to identify the optimized clusters of borrowers for early identification of NPAs. The quality of the proposed system is compared with various traditional algorithms like Genetic clustering (GC), K-means, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), etc.,and the experimental results show that our proposed system has a better performance in terms of purity and DB Index, when compared to K-Means, ACO, and GC. The early detection of default will enhance the profitability, liquidity of the banks. Technology will help bankers to eliminate the gap between resources and workload available and will lead to improved risk management and efficiency of the banks. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Agriculture is the main segment of Indian economy and driving force for all of the business sector, and nearly about 70% Indian farmers are producing the most needful crops like chili, potato, rice and so on. Being world’s largest spice provider, farmers are planting chilies for exporting worldwide. Also, for every daily food chili is required, hence there is huge need of chili worldwide. Hence it becomes necessary to have automation and live monitoring in chili farming to increase productivity. During production of chili there are several challenges, but disease management is a very critical factor out of it. Currently, there are very few farmers using the technology for disease detection or monitoring, which leads to big losses to production. Hence, we have proposed our new invention in this domain to provide fully automated and easy-to-use chili plant leaf disease detection system using support vector machine (SVM) [2] and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) [1] algorithm. With the help of image classification technique, we have implemented our proposed system and tested it on real-time dataset of various diseases. We have used GLCM [5] feature extraction technique to improve accuracy of detection. Furthermore, we have tested the system based on various case studies and compared the derived outcome with some existing traditional algorithm to prove high efficiency of our proposed system. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Security has a ubiquitous influence on cloud services. With technology advancement, the superiority of attacks is continuously scaling in volume. In response, the security experts have increased the defensive perimeters, enhanced the malware protection and upgraded the countermeasures to detect malicious activity. However, weak identity and access management system and destabilized privilege system has created loopholes for cloud security, resulting in abnormal development using unsecured credentialing challenges and vulnerable applications. Organizations, which do not focus on the importance of secure credentials, are at greater risk. Credentials (password) are considered as easiest and cheaper measures for security but are more susceptible to be stolen. The organizations internally might use technologies to protect credentials by applying new policies using an exclusive username and password credentials, which may protect their cloud accounts. In spite of this fact, the valuable cloud information at data stores accessed remotely by virtual logins to an organization leads to attack issues and challenges. Thus, a credential attack is the major root cause of other attacks occurrence. The objective of the research study is to revisit the concept of credential attack and its emerging root causes. The focal point is to represent a broad overview of credential attack, intensifying as a vital security aspect in the cloud. The paper purposes to reconsider the prior literature and highlighting on conclusive findings for prospective research in the interrelated sphere of influence based on the published reports and industry/organization work. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={It is often difficult for some people in rural India to diagnose a disease at an early stage due to lack of healthcare facilities and knowledge about its symptoms. Early diagnosis is the key for effective treatment of a disease and better living of the people. Providing sophisticated and accurate algorithms and techniques to overcome this issue will be revolutionary. Though hospitals in urban areas are using advanced technology for diagnosis and prognosis, proper diagnosis and prediction of diseases are a very hypercritical task. With the advancement of information technology and data sciences, disease diagnostic tools can be introduced to the general public, which can lower the burden of often depending on more expensive medical diagnostic technologies. Machine learning enables a system to learn from the previous data and takes decisions of its own. The programmer uses statistical techniques and feeds programs to the system using which it can store data and make decisions based on previous knowledge. The performance of the program increases with more and more training data. In this paper, we present a machine learning technique using Decision Tree Algorithm (DTL) to interconnect the symptoms and rearrange them and retrieve the most probable diagnosis. This technique allows the system to self-learn without using programming. This paper presents a system for diagnosis of common diseases, i.e., diabetes and heart diseases; by entering the symptoms into the system. Root node entropies are calculated for these two diseases by using the information gain for all the symptoms associated with these two diseases. The symptom values were categorized into three different levels, i.e., Low, Normal and High. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The main problem with today’s power consumption is to determine which load is consuming much power so that it can be disconnected to reduce high electrical bills. The main concern of today’s researches is to find an alternative way of installing a grid-connected PV system or other renewable resources free of harmful gases so that they add up to the electrical grids to provide enough power. This study presents how to synchronize a photovoltaic system with a grid to save money and electrical load management based on IoT technology. However, current sensing is used to sense the current when loads are connected and send the instantaneous value of current to the Arduino Uno which is programmed to find the total power consumed and then ESP 8266 WiFi module uploads the data to the Thingspeak for analysis and monitoring where utility company or users can access the information about the usage of electricity since many PV systems are in remote areas. A simulation of an inverter with PLL circuit for generating the desired signal waveform and frequency is done in MATLAB/Simulink and the objective was successfully achieved which showed that the output voltage is a sinusoidal waveform of the same frequency and same phase angle and a current sensor can be installed at the output of the inverter to sense the power generated for analysis and monitoring of the proposed PV system. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Healthcare Informatics mainly concerns with the management of patient medical information using different information technologies. The automated medical diagnosing is one of the main challenging tasks in healthcare informatics field due to diverse clinical considerations and the conflicting diagnosing that might occur. To this end, a Multi Agent Coordination-based Model (MACM) is presented in this paper to manage conflicts in decisions that might occurs during the diagnosing process. In MACM, a coordination between different agents will be applied in form of competition and negotiation processes. A Bidding Contract Competition Module (BCCM) is proposed to handle the bidding and contracting between agents. In addition, an Adaptive Bidding Protocol (ABP) is proposed to manage the bidding and selecting phases in BCCM. The performance of the proposed BCCM module are evaluated using number of experiments. The results obtained show better performance when compared to different multi agent systems. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The remarkable developments in wireless communication technologies in recent years along with the anticipation of further advances in these technologies have stimulated the efforts to investigate vehicle to everything (V2X) communication to increase road safety, improve traffic management, and facilitate infotainment applications. V2X communication is based either on cellular infrastructures such as 4G and 5G, or wireless LAN technologies such as the IEEE 802 protocol family. Several challenges, however, face the deployment of V2X. Examples of these challenges are routing, security, and analysis of collected data. Several research efforts have investigated computational intelligence methods to tackle these issues. In this paper, we review recent advances in computational intelligence in V2X communications. First, we provide preliminaries of V2X communication. Second, we discuss classical and computational intelligence solutions in V2X communication. Last, we present open problems and research challenges that need to be addressed to realize the full potential of V2X systems. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Huge amounts of useful data are easily generated and gathered currently at a rapid rate from a broad range of rich data sources in numerous applications and services in the real world. Data science applies database techniques, scientific and engineering methods, mathematical and statistical models, data mining algorithms, and/or machine learning tools to manage data, extract the useful information and discover the new knowledge from these big data. This explains why data science for big data applications and services has become a fundamental technology in providing novel solutions in various areas in business, engineering, health, humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, etc. (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, social life). Usually, data science focuses on big data management, analytics and visualization. Once big data are managed (i.e., captured, curated, managed and processed), big data are analyzed with an aim to discover interesting knowledge and information, which is usually presented in text or table form. Consistent with a proverb that “a picture is worth a thousand words”, big data visualization as well as visual analytics helps to reveal and explain the discovered interesting knowledge and information. In this paper, we present (a) big data management with focus on information fusion and the data lake; (b) big data analytics and mining, with focus on frequent patterns; as well as (c) big data visualization with focus on a few visual analytic systems for visualizing big data and mined frequent patterns. For illustration, we discuss these three aspects of data science on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. This highlights some important aspects of data science for big data analyses, services, and smart data. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Smart Cities offer the promise to improve the quality of live for their inhabitants. Therefore, new concepts and technologies for citizen participation is indispensable. Not only new mobility technologies, but digital-driven interaction between citizens and planners is a key component for future smart cities. In the U_CODE Project an innovative approach has been developed and backed up by technologies to enable this level of participation in urban development. This paper presents the User Engagement Protocols (UEP) and their testing in the testing for the smart campus design at the CJD Learning Campus Sangerhausen, which function as a case study. The UEP enables the moderators of the U_CODE process to concert the variety of actions and stakeholders during a co-designed urban development process. For every stakeholder and every phase, a specific UEP can be generated from a Master Protocol which covers the entire process. The methodical steps, which lead to this comprehensive process are shown in this paper, as well as the first application in the Sagerhausen Test Case. There a new campus for children with special requirements is planned together with the school administration, the teachers, parents and children. It proves the management possibilities of the U_CODE process in massive co-design urban development scenarios in a real environment. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The paper proposes an active-learning strategy aimed to increase class engagement and enhance student learning through the use of a Classroom Response System (CRS). A list of the commercially available CRS is reviewed. The motivation for designing an in-house CRS that addresses the limitations of the commercial CRS and solves specific needs of several automotive engineering courses is provided. The design and development of a mobile-based CRS at McMaster University in the School of Engineering Practice and Technology (SEPT) is presented. The CRS includes several modules that deal with the instructor and student interfaces, and with the infrastructure needed for a client-server application. The modules of developed CRS are described in detail. The paper presents the challenges that had to be mitigated during the development of the web-based applications and during its integration with the university’s Learning Management System. The benefits compared with commercial CRS justify the efforts to develop an in-house mobile web-based CRS software package. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. The constant hyperglycemia of diabetes is related to long-haul harm, brokenness, and failure of various organs, particularly the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and veins. This last can be monitoring by doctors over the internet and especially social networks. In this context, having a healthcare social media strategy is no longer optional, it’s a requirement. With the right strategy, social media will become a powerful tool to build trust, reach more patients, and spread valuable medical information. Furthermore, advances in mobile technology and the widespread use of smartphones and tablets will make an improvement in healthcare services at a rapid pace. In this paper, we propose a system that supports a community of diabetes people, their families and friends, doctors, nutritionist and anyone who might need or offer help and support to the community. Our objective is to develop a system that can predict, diagnose and monitor the diabetes or support diabetes self- management using machine learning algorithms and Big Data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The digital age offers opportunities for the development of online information and communications technology (ICT) systems that emphasize the important role of digital literacy, including communication between people and the values necessary for working in an online environment, which greatly influences the processes and practices of learning and teaching. Especially in the field of mobile learning, digital and data-evaluating skills are of great importance, as this type of technologically extended learning is based on a comprehensive use of cloud and internet-based services. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the German version of a validated 54-item questionnaire and to assess the level of digital literacies and digital readiness of undergraduate and graduate students at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences. An online questionnaire was developed based on the items designed by Kurtz and Peled [1]. The questionnaire included 54 items divided into seven areas: data research and retrieval; data validation; data management; data processing; teamwork; integrity awareness; and social responsibility. The items were translated into German language and their validity was evaluated with Cronbach’s Alpha in a pre-study on 155 students. After improvement of some items, all students from the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences were asked to complete the questionnaire. The first key outcome of this study is the validation of the German version of a validated 54-item questionnaire. The second key outcome is the level of digital literacies and digital readiness of undergraduate and graduate students at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences. Finally, we want to find out if there are differences in the digital competencies between the various degree programs of the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences. Our findings should enable faculty and educational policymakers to identify the strengths and weaknesses of digital literacies of students from the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the evolution of time, problem, and expectation of human beings, advancement of science and technology has facilitated scientific analysis of bulk dataset to generate desired output. This approach of bulk data analysis may be specifically implemented using Machine Learning and Data Analytics, which are the sub-domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The application of this cutting-edge technology can improve the efficiency of multivariate service sectors having societal significance (like legal system, education system, public transportation, rural healthcare management, etc), which directly or indirectly affect the well-being and productivity of an individual and the society as a whole. For example, India being a developing nation suffers due to insufficient number of judges, advocates, infrastructure, etc, and for which people have to wait long time to cherish their desired justice. In this paper, authors have proposed Machine Learning and Text Analytics-based legal support system to assist judges and advocates for faster delivery of justice to citizen. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Cloud computing has become an emerging model of information technology industry as it can be accessed anywhere in the world on a pay-per-use basis. However, one major problem it is facing in today’s challenging world is the security issues. The various existing key generation and management systems are suffering with the security issues. Along with the security feature, the data sharing is also more important issue to be studied. Considering these two parameters, it is necessary to work on the secure data sharing in public clouds. For that purpose, we have proposed an advanced key management system (AKMS) which can perform identity-based encryption. Also, the proposed AKMS type encryption provides high security, scalability, and flexibility in the public clouds. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={After the mechanical transformation and development in innovation in recent decades, there has been a fast increment in the assembling ventures and its squanders as a result of which huge amounts of wastes are generated. These wastes contain harmful elements, gases, and toxic substances. The decomposition and degradation of certain wastes generate landfill harmful gases. The wastes and gases lead to soil, air, and water pollution. To manage these wastes in an effective way we propose an approach that can provide a way of monitoring the wastes and the gas levels and managing it by taking measures. The idea is to make use of certain sensors or cells that detect changes in the wastes and gas levels. Making use of concepts of IoT, machine learning, and graphical representations to provide information about the current and future level changes in the wastes and gases in the regions where sensors are located. In this paper, we are focusing on the levels of changes in gaseous wastes including landfill gases generated due to the wastes in the various regions. The prediction results of the gas levels can help in taking preventive and precautionary measures for proper management and disposal of these wastes. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Given the application domains and challenges presented to cyber-physical systems (CPSs), it is necessary to design a CPS system able to deal with temporal constrains. There are various software architecture models to meet this challenge. Models have been developed under three types of software structural units, such as: Component-based architecture, service-based architecture and agent-based architecture. These models are analyzed under the compliance of adaptability, autonomy and interoperability properties. Our proposal provides a conceptual architecture model driven by events for the real-time management of CPS, which is proposed under the rigor of software engineering based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA 2.0 - Service Oriented Architecture) and directed by EDA events (Event Driven Architecture), using event processing technology CEP (Complex Event Processing). © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Over the past years, several initiatives have been emerged: industry 4.0 in Germany, smart manufacturing in the United States of America, internet + in China, future industry in France. Different nominations with an only objective, which is to make the company smarter: transformation in the organization and management of production as well as the entire logistics chain. Even the importance of this industrial revolution, there is a lack of research in the work of implementing Industry 4.0 concepts for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In order to facilitate the transformation, this work treats an approach through the presentation of a methodology for implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in supply chains. The objective of this article is to define an overview of Industry 4.0 and its impact on the optimization of the supply chain for SMEs, based on the literature review study, and pilot guide for a 4.0 transition strategy based on the method called DMAIC. In this study a framework of a methodology for implementing industry 4.0 is proposed and the elaboration of model is given in order to establish the technological means of industry 4.0 according to the objectives performance desired by the company. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The emergence of advanced smart technologies (e.g. Internet-of Things, Big Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence techniques) has created a number of innovations in handling supply chain activities and thus accelerate the transformation of the traditional supply chain towards a smart supply chain. Many existing studies focused only on applying smart technologies to facilitate smart manufacturing, but few ones addressed investigations covering smart technologies in the whole product lifecycle, namely the design and recovery stages. This paper interest focus on how smart technologies combined to product lifecycle management (PLM) contributes to realize sharing and integration of data in different lifecycle stages of the product? And how this could help to conduct a smart product and supply chain design? Moreover, the paper investigates the use of smart technologies especially during the product design phase where the supply chain configuration will be conducted. For this purpose, a framework is addressed and an UML model for smart product and supply chain design is proposed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={According to Microsoft, by 2025, 100% of new cars will be connected and by 2030, 15% of new cars will be autonomous, and will take care of sending, receiving and analyzing “large amounts of data”. Automobiles are becoming data centers on wheels. All these pieces of information can be used by many stakeholders (road authorities, leasing companies, municipalities, car manufacturers, insurers, workshops, emergency services, etc.) in the mobility space to improve processes. Taxi’s industry is a concrete example that is evolving rapidly. New competitors and technologies are changing the way traditional taxi services do business. In spite of this growth has created new effectualness, it has also created new challenges. Exploiting and understanding of the taxi supply and demand could increase the efficiency of the city’s taxi fleet management system. This paper describes a recommender system that recommends the most relevant pick-up points for a driver. It is based on spatiotemporal features, through data preprocessing and real-time recommendations. These recommendations could inform the drivers on where to position their taxi’s. We implemented a recommender system based on KMeans+Regression. Putting in the test with various features sets, we were able to achieve positive results. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the results, achieving approximately 98% accuracy in most cases. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Currently, supply chain management incorporates technologies from Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Manufacturing to improve performance and customer satisfaction. Supply chain digitalization helps organizations meet new customer needs, supply issues and existing efficiency improvement standards. In other words, digitalization leads to a faster, flexible and efficient supply chain. However, this digitalization has created new supply chain risks such as information and cybersecurity risks. The purpose of this paper is to discuss key supply chains 4.0 risks and examine the relationship between them. This study also presents a literature review related to the subject to well understand the Supply chain 4.0 risk management. The authors use the approach of the analytical hierarchy model (AHP) to analyze the supply chain 4.0 risks. The suggested study is useful for both academics and practitioners, as it illustrated the relatedness of supply chains 4.0 risks. This would help organizations confront new risks facing interconnected supply chains. The findings would help secure supply chains and strengthen organizations’ risk management. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Autonomous and connected cars are almost here, and soon will be an everyday reality. Driver desired comfort, road conditions, travel dynamics and communication requirements between vehicles have to be considered. Simulation can help us to find how to improve road safety and comfort in traveling. Traffic flow models have been widely used in recent years to improve traffic management through understanding how current laws, with human drivers, should change in this new environment. Early attempts to driving modelling were restricted to the macroscopic level, mimicking continuous physical patterns, particularly waves. However, extensive improvements in technology have allowed the tracking of individual drivers in more detail. In this paper, the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is used to examine traffic flow behavior at a vehicle level with emphasis on the relation to the preceding vehicle, similarly as it is done by the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems nowadays. This traffic model has been modified to simulate vehicles at low speed and the interactions with their preceding vehicles; more specifically, in traffic congestion situations. This traffic jam scenario has been analyzed with a developed simulation tool. The results are encouraging, as they prove that automatic car speed control can potentially improve road safety and reduce driver stress. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Emotional infection is considered as a social and psychological model of transferring the mental mood of the manager to other stakeholders of the information system creation projects, emotional impact in the face of direct contact, and the inclusion of the individual in certain mental states that affect to the success of management. The object of emotional infection technology is the manager or group, the task was to educate, educate and create the organization of new behaviour in neither adverse, complementary but nor contradictory internal and external conditions. In times of crisis, the emotional behaviour of the Information system project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of Information system projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological model for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of Information system projects success, these influences have been transformed into a competent model for managing these projects. Examples of changes in the competence of the manager and the project team in the case of a wall and asthenic emotions are given. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network is a rising technology that provides the various applications in defense and industries. Congestion and security are the main parameters in sensor networks. Congestion takes place when several nodes can transmit packets to a single channel. When nodes get closer to the sink, the traffic arises, which leads to congestion. It leads to loss of information, heavy packet loss, packet delay and less energy efficiency. A congestion control scheme is necessary to improve the quality of service (QoS) and system lifetime. The modified LACAS is to avoid traffic from many to one node. This is mainly designed for health care units. The nodes interact with the previous nodes at continuous intervals of time to reduce the congestion. Here, TADR algorithm with buffer management is implemented with MAC layer and transport layer. A TADR algorithm is designed to route packets around the blocking regions and spread out the unnecessary packets in different paths of idle nodes and low weighted nodes. The buffer automatically adapts the sensor’s forwarding rates to be nearly optimal without causing congestion. The simulation result shows that the throughput gets increased, and packet loss is reduced drastically. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly in today’s world. A big challenge nowadays is the large volume of data generated between WSN and the cloud infrastructure. Fog computing is a new technology that is an extension to the cloud where processing is performed at the edge of the network, reducing latency and traffic as well. Because of its structure, it has a high demand in healthcare applications, smart homes, supply chain management, smart cities, and intelligent transportation system. Nano data centers (nDCs) are called the tiny computers at the edge of the network. Load balancing is achieved by the current fog architecture. User request allocation technique plays a vital role in fog server energy consumption. The allocation of the user request task to fog servers in a fog environment is a difficult (NP-hard) problem. This article proposes a task consolidation for energy saving by reducing the unused nDCs in a fog computing environment and maximizing CPU utilization. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={India’s issue with solid waste management couldn’t be any more evident. This is because of the country’s inability to keep up with the waste it has generated due to rapid urbanization, industrialization, and population explosion; implementation of an effective waste management system hasn’t been fruitful. Indian domestic waste is found to be comparatively moister in nature and of lower calorific value. Hence, thermal technologies of management fail. A preeminent technology for Indian solid waste management would be its conversion into biomethane, which also happens to be an eco-friendly option. With utmost concern of this fact, a sustainable solution regarding the Public sector has been created in the effort of benefiting society at a community level. With an effort to bring back bio methanation with the perks of waste management (similar to ancient biogas stoves); this model aims at properly disposing the household wet waste and generating methane-based electricity from it to fuel a local park indefinitely. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Robots are engaged in various activities in our day-to-day life. The aim of this paper is to mitigate the need of a librarian for collecting books from the library counter and arranging them in respective racks one by one. The main principle of the Library automation robot is based on the following: Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID), dynamics of the robotic arm and Line Following. The software module allows the user to reserve books that are available in the library. This robot in the library will be helpful in eliminating the problem of misplacement of books. This line follower robot scans the RFID tag in the book and finds the place of the rack where the book needs to be placed. The proposed robot will pick and place the books in its respective racks. This project also provides the database of books available for reservation purposes regardless of the place. At the same time, it sends a reminder message to the user about the due dates. The aim of this robot is to replace the manual work in the library. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Inspired by the new advancements in machine learning and search engine technology, it is possible to caption videos and index them for efficient managing in applications like YouTube, Dailymotion, Netflix, etc. This system can generate a set of tags which when put together will give a sensible translation of the video in text format. The key challenge is the semantic gap between identification of objects by the human brain and the computer AI. In this proposed model, we propose to transcribe the video clips based on the contents and construct a pipeline through the convolutional neural network (CNN) which will efficiently and accurately process the video and search for the contents. This would require processing of the video clip and indexing it in a database. The same indexing will enable the use of this technology in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) tasks. The user can search for videos based on the context, and the time spent is seeking through the video to search for the scene is solved. We use deep learning model to search through video content and show that it performs efficiently. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={As the IoT incorporates large number of devices with different heterogeneous end systems, the software involved with these systems to run those algorithms and establishing the connections in the network with the help of various protocols is quite complex. With a wide range of diverse devices involved in the system, the design of the architecture should be carefully chosen for providing reliability as well as the scalability. The architecture may be different for various distributed systems located remotely like smart homes, agriculture, enterprise applications, manufacturing, energy management and monitoring of environment. One such architecture is fog. As the information is exchanged among these devices, keeping the information private and providing security by denying the access to un-authorized users is essential.

abstract={IoT is one of the developing technologies in recent years. Internet of things is a huge network, which provides human-to-human (H2H), machine-to-machine (M2M), and human-to-machine (H2M) communications. The IoT is still developing technology and has many research scopes. The IoT has varieties of applications, which makes human’s life easier. These IoT applications reduce human interventions and give the results more accurate. The IoT applications can be used in every domain. One such application is the maintenance of nursery based on the environment and weather conditions. It is more efficient and cost-effective. The aim of the proposed method is to design an automated model for maintaining the useful weather condition for the good growth of the tiny plants. The maintenance of nursery without human intervention using the IoT and cloud is the key ambition of the paper. The tiny plants are grown in the nursery, and hence, the health of the plant plays an important role. The nursery, tissue culture areas are providing farmers good yielding plants. To get good quality plants maintaining various environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and certain gasses is highly important. The model has been developed using Arduino Uno board, sensors, and Raspberry Pi model B. ThingSpeak, an open IoT platform with MATLAB analytics, is used for data collection and analysis. The simulation result gives the weather and environment conditions of the nursery on an hourly basis. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The penetration of technology is ever increasing and is encompassing more and more sectors day by day and rightly so—the advantages are huge. Specifically, the technology in consideration is the Internet of Things and data science. The implementation of these technologies is still unexplored in the field of retail. In this paper, we have discussed the importance of data in the field of data science and later explored the data that can be obtained and harnessed from the sector of retail. Many of the possible data science use cases in the field of retail have also been explored. Consequently, the architecture of the Internet of Things has been discussed and the possible use cases of the technology in the sector of retail have also been explored. The inclination is toward using these technologies for creating an enhanced retail experience for both the customers and the retail store manager by including on-the-cart billing, automated inventory management, product correlation and prediction for product replenishing duration. Finally, the realization, exploration, and visualization of the above view have been done in the implementation and the result’s section of the paper. The conclusion establishes the importance of the implementation of the above technologies and the benefits it brings toward creating an enhanced retail experience. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Handling large amount of information with the advancement of technologies is beyond the scope of conventional database technologies. As a solution to the above task, document management systems and machine learning techniques are used. The widely used supervised machine learning technique employing representative models are reviewed in this paper. A classifier creates a model for prediction. The fundamental concern in the classifier is to create an efficient document representation for representative modeling. The model represents documents in an algebraic vector form. The classical models for document representation are numerical vector representational model which gives the frequency of occurrence of the feature as the vector element. Feature extraction and feature selection are done for dimension reduction techniques. In this paper, we have reviewed some existing methods for document representation. The practical analysis and comparison on various techniques for document representation are presented here. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={After advent of Internet and cloud computing technology, many of the software solutions are hosted in cloud infrastructure (a.k.a SaaS) to enable customers to pay for services as they use. Having this situation, the software non-functional requirements such as ‘availability’ and ‘reliability’ have become critical as customers expect 24 × 7 support for their hosted applications. In such scenario, chatbot or conversational AI becomes more critical to act as the first point of contact to support customer’s queries to reduce multiple round trips between DevOps (Cloud infrastructure support team) to an extent possible. Currently, Team of MoD (manager on duty) is the first point of contact to support for any upcoming customer queries and if in need will be percolated down to team of developer on duty (DoD) for speedy issue resolution. In this paper, we are trying to build a novel solution of adaptive chatbot in providing contextual Q&A responses with built-in natural language template generation, building technical document corpus specific knowledge base, building document text summarization to fit into chatbot real estate, creating corporate technical document indexing to provide important document links and summarized text as response, creating support tickets for the issue reported with automated ticket routing classification to enable speedy resolution of customer queries by DoD with the techniques from information retrieval, information extraction, NLP, NLG, text summarization, text classification and ontology. This paper proposes customized text ranking algorithm by ensuring more weightage is given to document sentences having n-gram linked entities from ontology knowledge base. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The paper analyzes the geological and mineralogical features of a pyritic polymetallic deposit. The use of Kohonen neural networks in solving the problem of technological typification of this type of ore is justified, since the flotation process is essentially a multifactorial and nonlinear object. The associative method of analyzing phenomena is more direct and visual than the “implicit” setting of connections or regularities in the form of a formalized mathematical model of a narrow range of phenomena. In the case of Kohonen neural network modeling, the image of a multidimensional space on a single plane in the form of a two-dimensional grid, on which the trend of changes in the processed ore mixture can be applied, is more adequately perceived by the operator. To achieve higher reliability in the identification of topological Kohonen maps for diagnostic purposes a methodology is proposed, which includes the interpretation of calculated average values of studied parameters of all neurons, using the method of factor analysis, design of selected neurons on the plane of the main components Fi – Fj and applying on them the physical values of the vectors of the measured parameters and contour lines of output functions. The developed technology can be introduced at the plant online with the help of express data analysis control, which allows you to promptly change the reagent modes in order to achieve higher metal recovery and better quality of the resulting concentrates. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Determining the factors influencing students’ intention to use Augmented Reality (AR) allows a deeper understanding on how students react to the use of such technologies in their training as engineers. This study aims to identify the emotional and cognitive factors that influence the students’ intention of using AR in their future professional life and to access possible gender differences. A group of about 150 undergraduate students from an Engineering and Industrial Management program had the opportunity to explore AR applications related to contents addressed in Sensors and Actuators course. A survey was designed and used with those students. Principal component analysis resulted in three components named interest, ease of use and attitude. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with these three components together with gender, as predictors of intention of using AR in later professional life. Attitude turned out to be the strongest predictor. This analysis has also shown that gender has no significant effect. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Negotiation emerges in our lives whenever a decision needs to be made together with someone else. In the nursing field, negotiation is well represented in the relationship between the nurse and the patient. For this reason, it is important to help nurses to develop their communication skills, starting from the training period. The aims of this study were to identify the negotiation styles of nursing students with a serious game and to evaluate the effect of a tailored intervention on negotiation skills. The serious game was based on Rahim and Bonoma’s theory of conflict management and included five scenarios of daily life situations. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to evaluate the students’ negotiation styles before and after the intervention and the times spent to complete the game’s scenarios. Results showed that nursing students preferred an integrating negotiation style and that they improved their compromising style after the intervention. The students were generally oriented towards using problem-solving reasoning and, after the intervention, renouncing something in order to reach a mutually acceptable decision in the included scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a negotiation serious game in the nursing learning field and serves as an example of how technology can be accepted and integrated in education to help nursing students develop not only their technical but also relational skills. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Sustainable safe functioning of electric power networks ensures uninterrupted supply of electricity to consumers within the limits of acceptable (standardized) indicators of its quality. Meteorological factors influence the process of power transmission through power lines. The impact of hydrometeorological phenomena and processes is associated with losses in energy transmission, short-term and long-term power supply disruptions, and direct damage to infrastructure facilities. Due to the need to predict weather conditions and timely response, this study proposes a general approach to the synthesis of the power supply management system and the geo information system. Managing the process of uninterrupted electric power supply requires the formation of processes with predefined properties. The concept of management based on synthesis fulfills these requirements. The use of a geo information system eliminates interruptions in the supply of electricity to consumers. It is shown that the basis for controlling the process of required power supply is a person’s decision. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Organizations are faced with a clear need for increasing the maturity of their cybersecurity capabilities to keep pace with the ever-evolving cyber threats and accelerated institutional digitalization driven by financial reward and competitive edge. In this context, organizations acknowledge the importance of strengthening their cybersecurity programs to protect critical business processes along with the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information and information systems through people, processes, and technology by preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber attackers resorting to sophisticated cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Meanwhile, national and international standardization bodies reacted through the development of various cybersecurity risk management frameworks and standards that can be leveraged by organizations while maturing their cybersecurity capabilities. In a nutshell, this paper aims to provide a critical evaluation of several widespread cybersecurity risk management frameworks adopted by organizations to alleviate cyber risks. The paper starts with an introduction about the key drivers for adopting a cybersecurity risk management framework within organizations. Further, the paper gives an overview of several well-renowned cybersecurity risk management frameworks and related standards, methods and methodologies. Furthermore, the paper defines the evaluation criteria used for comparing frameworks and provides a holistic evaluation of selective cybersecurity risk management frameworks aiming to support decision-making with respect to framework selection, facilitate pragmatic implementation of cybersecurity programmes, and help organizations cope with cybersecurity risks. Finally, the paper presents the concluding remarks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={In this article, an abelian group G = (−1,0,1) is considered. In addition, advantages of using this group for digital signal processing were demonstrated. The main of ones are a natural form of representation of negative numbers, as well as natural digital form of slowly changing signals. This group is isomorphic to multiplicative group formed by three cubic roots of unity. This isomorphism can be used in implementation of computer systems in which physical representation of logical variables is carried out through a phase of a signal. This multiplicative group may turn out a very promising for development of computer systems where information about value of a logical variable (whatever is meant by this term) is embedded in the phase of the oscillating signal. The oscillating signals are the most promising object for implementation of quantum, optical and nanocomputing systems, since the implementation of stable states (or stable currents) that correspond to classical approaches to the creation of computer technology is problematic here. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={This work is devoted to studying the capabilities of the IOSO NS GT 2.0 software package using the example of optimizing a film cooling system with injection through circular holes. The maximum value of the film cooling efficiency was determined on the basis of a single software package that includes a program for calculating cooling efficiency and a search algorithm within the optimization environment. The search for the global maximum of film cooling efficiency was carried out first by varying two, and then five main system parameters. This allowed us to determine the optimal values of the parameters at which the cooling efficiency when blowing the curtain through a series of circular holes increases by 30%. This change is caused by an increase in the blowing parameter to a value equal to 1.236 in the case of normal (to the plate surface) coolant supply for conditions typical of the operation of gas turbine blades (turbulence intensity is 10%). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The article describes the proposed method of choosing the shape of effective infrared reflective devices during the design of energy-efficient hardware complexes for drying polymer insulation of electrical equipment, based on the comparative calculation of radiation viewfactors, using computer-aided engineering analysis technologies. Theoretical calculations on the use of infrared radiation to heat various surfaces are presented as justification of the necessity to choose reflector shapes. The paper analyzes the basic methods of calculating the angular radiation coefficients, identifies the advantages and disadvantages of each. The proposed technique is based on the construction of 3D models of infrared emitters with reflective devices of various shapes, which are located above the copper backing. In this case, the copper backing acts as a recorder of thermal fields. First of all, viewfactors were taken as selection criteria, depending on the shape of the reflective device and its relative position with regard to the emitter. A half-cube method was chosen as a method of calculating viewfactors due to its relative simplicity and high accuracy. The second criterion was the distribution of the thermal fields of heating of the irradiated surface and the reflector itself. The technique consists in a stepwise assessment of these criteria. As a result of the calculations, a trapezoidal reflector with an expansion angle of 150° has the best performance. The proposed technique gives clear and demonstrable results in terms of choosing the effective forms of infrared reflective devices, allowing one to quickly configure heating modes. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Use of technology has become a part of our everyday life. New innovative technologies are getting developed and everyone is getting dependent on it. Governments, businesses, and individuals use systems, networks, and the Internet to access, process, and store and share their huge amount of data. This data is getting compromised by malicious people/cyber criminals and hackers causing enormous loss. One of the major hindrances in tackling the cybercrimes is lack of skilled professionals in the information security sector. There exists a huge gap in demand and supply of these professionals. This gap is only going to get wider in the future if we do not take adequate steps now. This paper discusses the challenges in the cybersecurity teaching and lists out the different teaching methodologies. The paper highlights some of the innovative teaching techniques which the educational institutions can adopt to make cybersecurity education more exciting and meaningful. The idea is to generate interest among the students to think and make cybersecurity as a career option. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The developed methods are necessary for monitoring the state of scientific and innovative activities of the university, as a first step in building its management system. The aim of the work is to develop a method of hierarchical aggregation of data based on their presentation in the form of a quasi-neural network structure, the input of which is the data itself, and the output is a set of metadata or indicators of the state of the scientific and innovative activity of the university, characterizing the degree of data compliance with their planned criteria indicators. The leading approach includes: semantic decomposition of data into elementary aggregates; formation of aggregate metadata in the form of indicators characterizing the degree of compliance of aggregated data with planned criteria indicators. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Healthcare Blockchains (HBC) are grooming nowadays due to the requirements of flexible Electronic Health Records (EHR) management, privacy needs, and controlled medical data access. Blockchain technology very much suits these requirements and support in various healthcare data access control methods. More focus on improved block generation time gives the expected blockchain performance. Block generation time can be significantly improved by the consensus algorithms used by the system. Traditional consensus algorithm of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) require heavy computational resources and hence by computational overheads. The proposed system introduces a new privacy-preserving HBC consensus protocol as a consequence of member attribute values and significantly reduced computational resources. The new attribute-based consensus algorithm for HBC called Proof of Policy (PoP) is constructed using Attribute-Based Ring Signature (ABRS). This signature agrees on the stake of attribute-based ring membership and can be considered as an extension of Proof of Stake (PoS). It is also found that the proposed PoP consensus algorithm requires less computational resources than popular PoW and PoS. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

abstract={In the last decade, world has faced a lot of troubles in terms of epidemics. Dengue infection is one of the cruelest of such epidemics that has already taken a large number of human lives. Citizen who survives after getting infected by Dengue virus, often suffer from severe side effects that largely impacts their lives, minds, and social interference. Researchers have imparted various notions of methodologies toward care, cure, and management of such patients. But, due to some social obligations and lack of awareness, the information about dengue infection in a particular geolocation gets hidden from the citizen. Administration and associated agencies seem to be reluctant in facilitation of dengue related information. Thus, creating a dangerous situation for the affected zone of dengue. Most of the cases, the information about the dengue affected patients is leaked, damaged, or lost while transferring from hospitals, clinics, or diagnostic centers to the local, regional, national, or global administration agencies. In this paper, we propose a novel system model to minimize the loss or leakage of such valuable information in form of electronic health record by using consortium blockchain platform. The proposed system model, i.e., DengueCBC is envisaged to leverage possible improvement in the current scenario of loss or damage of dengue specific electronic records. The proposed model enables the health clinics to securely transfer the dengue health record in electronic form to administration health agency. The process of such transmission is proposed to be highly secure, robust, tamper-proof, and immutable in nature. Stakeholders having decentralized ledger technologies can get associated with the proposed model to get transparent information about the dengue-based electronic data transmission. Thus, the system model encompasses a new way of catering dengue data transmission in more advanced fashion. We further perform comparison between DengueCBC and existing literature to prove the effectiveness of this model. Lastly, we present some open issues related to the proposed system model and other related works that could be mitigated by implying the prescribed future directions. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Indian corporations provide financial statements in a unique way according to the nation’s necessity. Making uniformity in accounting standards will arise as a huge job. This has fixed by the implementation of IFRS, as IFRS is a popular accounting language for the companies located worldwide. IFRS across the globe is comprehensible and similar. Within the modern globalization, technology in which the Indian financial system has also flourished, adopting IFRS would render Indian business enterprise on an equal footing with other global businesses. This will lead to widening the scope of the Indian market’s foreign financing. To converge with IFRS, India also decided by creating an Ind-AS standard. This study examines the perception of accounting professionals toward the awareness and adoption of IFRS. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Blockchain is a decentralized technology that manages the constantly growing list of records called blocks linked together using cryptography. Blockchain is a public distributed database that holds encrypted ledgers with high security and has the ability to transform various fields including educational field. Blockchain eliminates intermediary bodies which maintain a private database of records and makes all records public with increased transparency thereby reducing the data management cost. The process involved in blockchain is more democratic, transparent, and efficient and therefore, it has the potential to disrupt multiple industries. As the Information contained in blockchain is tamper-proof and due to the digital immutability feature, blockchain has the ability to disrupt education industry as well. This paper describes how educational industry experts can use this technology as a transparent and secured system for sharing academic records and student’s achievements. Although the implementation of blockchain technology in education field is at its infancy stage, this paper proposes Academic Blockchain and implements the core functionality of providing student records in academic blockchain thereby facilitating stakeholders in education field the ease of access. The challenges this technology puts forward and the opportunities it provides is all that is needed to revolutionize our digital world. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Interactive videos are becoming common in distance learning, especially for training on procedures to be executed in critical situations, as a complement to simulation sessions in real settings. To this end, research in educational technology devotes attention to the definition of methodologies and authoring tools for teachers and instructional designers. The ELEVATE project is developing a tool suite that offers a novel environment for authoring interactive videos to be deployed and used on popular Learning Management Systems (LMS), e.g. Moodle. One of the project case studies concerns continuous training of obstetric and neonatal teams on the Newborn Life Support (NLS) procedures. This case study helps us identify key requirements for a methodology to support instructional designers while creating and managing interactive video exercises. The latter are to be delivered as part of the blended course material made available to professionals on an LMS. This paper presents the NLS procedures case study to illustrate the ELEVATE tool-supported authoring approach. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

For further data analysis, the statistics or quantitative data in these reports have to be converted to CSV (.csv) or Excel (.xlsx) files. This is done manually by companies. This consumes a lot of time and manual work which can be reduced for better utilization of resources. Forecomp is a web application to automatically convert the tables in the PDF to CSV files. The tables could be present in text format or as an image. The web application is built keeping flexibility in mind such that the user can select the process used to convert the PDF into CSV files based on the tables in their PDF. Different technologies used in this application include YOLO model for machine learning, Tesseract OCR, Tabula, and an inbuilt snipping tool. This paper introduces the concepts behind Forecomp focussing on the methodology employed and the various results obtained. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The paper covers the issue of enterprise digital maturity assessment. This issue is relevant for modern enterprises being in the process of digital transformation. The tendency of the information community towards a qualitative change in organization management determines the development of the economy, increasing labor efficiency and improving the quality of life. Enterprises need to understand how to conduct business in changing conditions, what strategies and management methods to use in order to further maintain their competitiveness. Knowledge of the enterprise digital maturity level allows implementing and improving existing processes in order to become more attractive from the digital point of view. The paper represents a detailed analysis of enterprise maturity assessment methodologies as well as their key points, main advantages and limitations. Describing the basics of the project management approach, a rationale for the transition from process maturity assessment to digital assessment was proposed.

abstract={As QoE is useful to uniformly handle many kinds of application flows, we have been tackling QoE-oriented network resource management based on SDN technology. Toward this goal, our previous study proposed a QoE measurement method for on-going streaming flows. However, the standard QoE calculation model requires at least 8 s for collecting the flow information. In this study, we tackle early QoE prediction on a SDN-enabled multi-path network. To predict video QoE as soon as possible, we exploit not only packet loss rate measured regularly but also the number of packet transmissions by short-period measurement at the flow arrival. Finally, through experiments, we demonstrated that QoE of all flows can be maximized by selecting an appropriate route based on the predicted QoE. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolving technology in computer networks. One of SDN challenges is the lack of a standard SDN high-level framework, which provides an abstraction to lower levels through an easy to use high level interface without getting involved in difficult and complex programming tasks. Consequently, we propose IoTManager, an SDN concern-based management framework for IoT networks. IoTManager provides high level abstraction in SDN management layer through the separation of network concerns. IoTManager translates a set of input keywords into policies based on network management function and network concerns. Our translator is hybrid; proactive as it inserts OpenFlow rules to switches based on defined policies and reactive where it handles events according to the defined policies. A network scenario simulation via mininet shows our framework’s functionality and the high-level policies the framework can support converting them to low level flow rules. In addition, the performance is measured through calculating the different processing times. Moreover, the proposed abstraction facilitates managing the network through separation of concerns thus dividing the network management problem to less-complex sub-problems. Additionally, it helps closing the semantic gap between the intents of network administrators and the languages in which those intents can be encoded. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Urbanization has risen the levels of economic, social, and political changes that have led to various serious socioeconomic problems. The unplanned growth of population and development for meeting the needs of the society has made the situation worse have led to such an impactful situation. Urbanization had sown seeds for a sheer growth of transport vehicles on roads with constant or reduced parking spaces in Indian cities. The parking situation worsens in metropolises, where the land is limited and expensive. Shortage of parking spaces leads to traffic congestion, disproportionate demand and supply, saturated parking space, inappropriate tariffs, on-street, off-street parking, cruising, environmental pollution, and degradation are associated problems. Because of the poor management and policies of India, the parking solutions have become extremely overcrowded. The proposed smart parking system envisions smart cities by blending cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) based low-cost sensor technology with smartphones enabled payment systems along with real -time data analytics. The collected information can be suitably displayed on billboards, information boards, and other smart boards at various crucial junctions of the city thereby guiding, streamlining, and controlling traffic and congestion. The parking system allows the users to reserve an advance slot, pick a desirable empty location, and cancel the slot if required. The model also proposes to develop a 3-dimensional imagery of the entire solution on display. The smart parking solution would help generate efficient city landscapes by creating a seamless and urban mobility system for effective user experience. However, the solution demands effective data visualization, standardization and analytics, smartphone integration with IoT technology along with stakeholders cooperation and coordination. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Effective automation and digitalization of the business requires approaches to the formation of an integrated management system, including the IT architecture. A modern enterprise is a complex system of management technologies, operational and information technologies, the synergistic effect of the use of which allows creating an effective and flexible business structure. The aim of this paper is to present an architectural model for the integration of management technologies, operational and information technologies. The development of such a model is especially relevant in the context of the ongoing digital transformation of the business, since the introduction of digital technologies in industrial enterprises will affect both elements of business and IT architectures, as well as elements related to production technologies. The methodological basis for the integration of technologies is the architectural and process approaches. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The advancement of technology makes remote management and monitoring of environmental systems increasingly close, accessible and necessary. For several applications, it is important to have an equipment to gather data and information in a friendly, remotely, and easy-to-access platform. The system that was developed consists of modular telemetry equipment and a server. Its fundamental characteristics are flexible architecture, energy autonomy and remote communication. It is designed and constructed by independent modules, which provide versatility allowing the reuse of the hardware on multiple applications. It enables to rapidly develop a prototype to test an idea. The Arduino platform was used to develop the modules because it is an open software and hardware platform, its philosophy is aligned with the purpose of this project. The server, developed using open software, has databases for storage and a web service for data display and control. The versatility of the equipment was tested in two particular applications: monitoring of beehives sound for environmental pollution control, and determination of the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen present in the water of river courses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The article describes the use of a Self-Contained Self-Rescuer and the results obtained in the field tests of the SCSR (Model SHS-30E) manufactured by Corporation Roshimzaschita, performed in the mines of India. The results state that a 30-min duration SCSR can run for longer periods of time. Actual time of protection varies from person to person depending on their breathing pattern, physical and respiratory health. In the case of emergency, it is difficult to assess the actual time of protection of miners who are making self-rescue to the surface, the fresh air base or to the Refuge Chamber from the workplace in a mine. A Rescue Team does not always have data on the condition of the miners stuck underground in case of emergency. To prepare for these situations, such a SCSR is required that can be used in case of underground emergencies and can provide its users with navigation guidelines, health parameter monitoring and help the rescue team to reach the miner. The SCSR presented in the article allows solving the aforementioned safety problems, which is becoming a necessity and can be observed by the field tests at the Mines Rescue Station, M/s Western Coalfields Limited, Nagpur, India. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network consists of irreplaceable sensor nodes which are equipped with limited energy resources. Minimizing energy consumption is one of the main problem in wireless sensor networks. This paper proposes an energy conservation and consumption in wireless sensor networks based on clustering routing protocol. The protocol adopts clustering technology to solve the hot spots problem and proposes cluster head priority mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of head nodes in the clusters partition. Firstly, a new network structure model using the cluster members and cluster head and combines existing energy consumption model to construct a new method that determine the optimal for total energy conservation. Finally, we simulated this protocol both with 100 nodes network capability. Simulation results prove that our proposed protocol can effectively improve better performance than LEACH in terms of first node dead, network lifetime, and throughput. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The article considers the environmental pollution of the urbanized area with heavy metals and explores their effect on the oncological incidence of the population. Using modern GIS technologies, the content of heavy metals in soils of the city of Vladikavkaz was interpolated according to the available results of laboratory studies of soil testing and the corresponding maps were constructed. According to the results of the studies, a linear dependence of the oncological morbidity of the population on the content of heavy metals in soils is obtained. The reliability coefficient of approximation R2 = 0.14 indicates that the contribution of the content of heavy metals in soils to the total incidence of oncology in the population can be up to 14% of the total contribution of all factors that form the final value of the incidence. It was found that the following elements have the greatest impact in decreasing order: arsenic, mercury, and cadmium. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={FPGAs are a powerful technology for teaching hardware design, through which students can learn how to design hardware using common hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog. However, the use of FPGAs in the classroom has several different problems, such as availability or associated costs of acquiring and maintaining the FPGAs. Also, relying on FPGA boards in the classroom is typically problematic because students cannot use the boards for doing projects after classes or during weekends. To solve this problem, remote laboratories can help allow more flexibility to students. A remote laboratory is a hardware and software system that allows students to access a real FPGA located somewhere else on the Internet. In this article, a cross-national remote laboratory is presented. This remote laboratory has multiple copies (17 devices at the time of this writing) deployed both in UPNA (Spain) and UNIFESP (Brazil), and using LabsLand (Spain) for technology and management of the laboratory. Students of both institutions access these laboratories transparently. This provides automatic fault tolerance and increases the potential number of concurrent students using the laboratories by sharing the boards among both institutions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Every year, companies and financial institutions worldwide lose billions due to credit card fraud. With the advancement in electronic commerce and communication technology and the development of modern technology, there has been an increase in the usage of credit cards and also the risks associated with it. Financial fraud detection systems are being implemented everywhere to minimize these losses. In the real world, fraudulent and real transactions are scattered all around and it is extremely difficult to distinguish between them. There is a class imbalance problem due to the minority of fraudulent transactions. The enormity of imbalanced data poses a challenge on how well Machine Learning techniques can efficiently detect fraud with a high prediction accuracy, and at the same time reduce misclassification costs. In this paper, experiments are performed to compare the most commonly used ML algorithms and investigate their performance when applied to a massive and highly imbalanced dataset. We compare six Supervised Machine learning techniques, namely, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid development of modern information technology, intelligent teaching platforms have been integrated into the classrooms. Convenient and efficient online teaching has become a part of teaching in institutions of higher learning. Through questionnaires and personal interviews, it showed that most students have high satisfaction with online teaching, but there are still problems such as low adaptability makes it difficult to guarantee the teaching effect. Aiming at improving teaching efficiency, this paper constructs the evaluation system index of online teaching and uses the analytic hierarchy process to analyze and explore. Finally, corresponding measures are proposed from four aspects of teachers, students, teaching environment and teaching management based on the quantitative analysis results, to provide theoretical support for the improvement of online teaching quality in universities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The present research is aimed to elaborate recommendations on sanitary purification and disposal of solid waste. Today all large cities endure a hard situation with municipal solid waste management; the placement of waste recycling plants (WRP) and waste transfer stations and the choice of a waste disposal technology are still remaining urgent problems. More than 20 methods of waste neutralization and disposal have been known by this day. Each of these methods includes 5–10 kinds of techniques, technological schemes, major equipment, types of facilities. Many issues that concern elaboration of recommendations on realignment of sanitary purification system in cities have to deal with the problems of disposal and recycling of some industrial wastes. Developments regarding systems of recycling municipal solid waste in cities will have much stronger economic effect if this problem is considered together with the issues of recycling a part of industrial and medical waste. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The blood is a connective tissue in the body and one of the most critical elements of human life. The shortage of this life-saving fluid has become a recurrent problem to deliver medical care in many countries, because in emergencies, relatives of patients run around to get specific blood type when unavailable at the medical institution, without adequate information on the closest available source. While there are existing blood bank management systems that help locate available blood bank centers with the needed blood type, they do not provide information on the nearest center and donor. This research therefore developed a web based system that provides information for the discovery of the blood bank centers and human donors with the highest proximity during emergencies. Web development technologies were used, and the Google Map API was used to track, calculate and display the location of each blood bank and donor. The system thus aid users in obtaining blood faster rather than going from one hospital to another in search for a specific blood type to reduce the number of deaths caused by lack of blood during emergencies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={This study is based on students attending a polytechnic higher education. It was concluded that, regardless of their social and ethnic origin, their behavior at certain times intersects with age, choices, motivation, success and failure, among others. Polytechnic Institutes offer several courses in different areas, such as higher vocational technical courses (2 curricular years), bachelor’s programs (3 curricular years). For this study, we select some specific courses from the School of Technology and Management of the Polytechnic Institute of Beja, namely: 1) the course Web Technologies and Mobile Devices, the course Networks and Information Systems, Computer Engineering (Bachelor’s Degree). These 3 courses were chosen based on their common point, digital skills; 2) Legal Services (face-to-face), Legal Services (e-learning), these courses are in the area of law, and due to the difference in teaching methodology. The most important aspect of these choices were the scientific areas, as they are literally opposite. This survey intends to verify if school success/failure depends on age and/or choice of scientific area. To what extent are the student’s characteristics combined with the course ones linked to failure/achieving success? How to act, what initiatives can we take to tackle failure and enhance success? The study focused on document analysis, analysis of statistical indicators, provided by the quality office of the Polytechnic Institute of Beja and on observation in the classroom. During the investigation, we concluded that age is not a decisive factor for school failure, while the scientific area is debatable, as long as courses in the same area are not analyzed. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The advanced market of engineering services is essentially important for a shift to the age of industry 4.0, since it determines the potential capacity of a country for creating science-driven productions, improving technologies under conditions of digital transformation, increasing the existing capacities through implementation of large high-tech investment-and-construction projects. Within the study, the stage of development of engineering in Russia was assessed as a method of promoting innovations applied within the process of elaboration and implementation of investment-and-construction projects under digital transformation of the economy. The study involved analysis, comparison, generalization, grouping and modeling methods. Legislative acts of the Russian federation were used, as well as regulatory documents on activities in construction engineering, statistical and analytical proceedings and documentation, materials from scientific conferences, official publications on problems of engineering development when implementing investment-and-construction projects. During the study, some external, legal and technological factors that restrain the development of the engineering services market were revealed and some ways to neutralize them were found. The following factors of technological revolution were identified: transition to digital economy and thereby transition from investment-and-construction engineering to digital engineering in the framework of investment-and-construction activities. Processes of digital engineering were investigated in terms of projects implemented by ViPS Group of Companies and their general contractor ZAO Strabag. The main advantages of digital engineering were analyzed when implementing investment-and-construction projects in Russia. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

The materials and results are presented in accordance with the basis of a project on a highway section reconstruction by means of geosynthetics. An optimal method for solving the main problem in road construction, being the impact of negative external factors causing the destruction of the pavement structure is studied in the paper. The essence of the method is impregnation of the synthetic material with a binding solution, in this case, a bitumen emulsion, which will ensure its good adhesion to asphalt concrete. Results of the study: The theoretical and experimental data of geosynthetic layers reinforcing functions and their functional interaction with other layers in the structure of road covering were analyzed. The materials and results found on the basis of highway section reconstruction project with the use of geosynthetics are presented. Given the current trends in the road construction providing for the optimization of all processes in order to improve their operational properties and achieve maximum economic efficiency of the decisions made, the research on geosynthetic materials is relevant today. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={In recent decades, society has a primary need for improving education systems. Predicting the performance of students has become a reference topic very analyzed by the research community. Currently, there are several cutting-edge technologies that make very easy to collect educational data in institutional systems due to the new information management systems where almost everything is digitalized. The analysis of this information offers unique opportunities that have a direct impact on students, instructors and academic institutions programs. Concretely, we propose a modular system to evaluate teaching performance by considering several primary factors related to students learning process. In this work, we present the first module, a statistical model that aims at obtaining the expected student’s achievements in a particular course. We first analyzed students’ performance primary factors on Higher Education Systems. To identify these factors, we have conducted a literature review. Then, we examine three different techniques to build the prediction model: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). To select the suitable technique, we carried out a variety of experiments by using a real dataset from University of Santa Elena (Ecuador). The achieved experiments revealed promising results. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Indiscriminate disposal of solid waste is a major issue in urban centers of most developing countries and it poses a serious threat to healthy living of the citizens. Access to reliable data on the state of solid waste at different locations within the city will help both the local authorities and the citizens to effectively manage the menace. In this paper, an intelligent solid waste monitoring system is developed using Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies. The fill level of solid waste in each of the containers, which are strategically situated across the communities, is detected using ultrasonic sensors. A Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) communication link is used to transmit the sensor data to an IoT cloud platform known as ThingSpeak. Depending on the fill level, the system sends appropriate notification message (in form of tweet) to alert relevant authorities and concerned citizen(s) for necessary action. Also, the fill level is monitored on ThingSpeak in real-time. The system performance shows that the proposed solution may be found useful for efficient waste management in smart and connected communities. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The use and consumption of electricity occurs everywhere and constantly, including in social and economic systems. With the development of information technologies, including web technologies, they are being introduced into all spheres of human life, including those being introduced and used at electric power distribution facilities. Software and hardware systems are being introduced, allowing for control and operational monitoring of electricity distribution, as well as its consumption. Along with the development of software tools that help in everyday activities of a person to interact with power distribution plants, there is a destructive impact from outside that destroys the normal operation of the system. Power outages caused by the destructive effect on this hardware and software complex can cause great damage to the entire system of social and economic systems and only a correctly constructed model of an adequate response to emerging threats will allow the person exercising control to respond in a timely manner and eliminate the destructive impact in order to further normal distribution of electricity, including using web-based technologies online, wherever he is. This model will allow you to redistribute the time resource, which will increase the success of achieving the management goal. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The relevant issue of urban transport infrastructure development is studied. The growth of social-and-economic processes, the rise in the standard of the population living, has led to the rapid increase in the number of passenger transport. The development of construction in cities, the consolidation of residential areas involves the improvement and development of transport and social infrastructure as well as the transport conditions. According to the domestic and foreign statistical data, the analysis of the state of transport infrastructure development is carried out and the structure of the forecast transport model is proposed. The impact of modern information technologies on improving the quality and safety of transport is also assessed. The developed forecast model for optimal development of transport infrastructure and the use of territories will allow to simplify the process of building a road network at the micro- and macro- levels; to display all the specifications of public and private transport in a single model; to solve operational and strategic tasks of transport planning for the preparation of projects for the organization and analysis of traffic flows at intersections and junctions. The practical significance is that the planning of transport flows of infrastructure will improve the efficiency and safety of urban transport through the use of modern communication technologies, computer systems and specialized software. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Purpose: There are many methods, techniques and technologies for the formation of directive (prescribed for use) standards of integrated security: • fundamentally new (original); • developed “by analogy with world experience” (adapted); • borrowed. Methods: The elemental base of the methodology of these norms extends to all known spheres of life: • “environmental” or the sphere of human existence in nature; • “social” or the sphere of collective relationships and interactions in the community; • “technogenic”, recultivated, or the sphere of all material created in processes of thought and subsequent productive activities of a person; • “informational” or the sphere of origin, perception, processing, accumulation, transmission and impact of information, as well as reactions to it; • “energy” or the sphere of detection (generation) of energy. Results: Modern theoretical concepts (not related to business and employment problems) combine the last two areas into one “informational and energy” sphere based on the well-known functional dependence of the “bit” and “joule” units (according to Felker). Conclusion: For each of these five spheres of life, as appropriate, legitimate (authorized for use by the official authorities) averaged standards of integrated security that have an officially regulated period of their functioning are created. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The subject of barriers and restrictions for innovative projects of the road sector, the purpose of which is to increase energy efficiency, is considered. A methodological rationale for the implementation of adaptive traffic control systems is proposed. An assessment of the economic efficiency of the project in one of the cities of Russia was carried out. A conclusion was made about high rates of commercial, social, and regional effectiveness. In order to assess the feasibility of an innovative project, a number of limitations must be taken into account that may affect its effectiveness and achievement of the goals set. In accordance with the research concept, barriers and limitations for the project are considered by the following groups: economic; financial; HR, technical and technological; forecasting innovation; resistance of the existing system; specific; barriers to networks and interactions; socio-psychological; organizational and management. To interpret the level of impact of each barrier, it was assessed by a developed scale. Based on the proposed approach, an expert assessment of barriers and limitations was carried out for the project of implementing an adaptive automated traffic control system. It is concluded that the project does not have critical barriers. Its implementation is advisable, but it is necessary to implement a set of measures to smooth out the possible negative impact. As a result of this, a high socio-economic effect will be achieved due to a significant improvement in the operating conditions, which will contribute to increasing the energy efficiency of the transport complex. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The need for the logistics sector to timely respond to the increasing requirements of a globalised and digitalised world relies greatly on the competences and skills of its labour force. It becomes therefore essential to reinforce the cooperation between universities and business partners in the logistics and supply chain management fields across the European region and to build a logistics knowledge cluster supported by a communication and collaboration platform to foster continuous learning, skill acquisition and experience sharing anytime anywhere. In this paper we focus on designing the conceptual and technical framework for a communication and collaboration platform with the aim to establish the communication pipelines between the partner institutions, facilitating user interactions and exchange, leading to the creation of new knowledge and innovation in the logistics field. This framework is based on the requirements of the three main stakeholders: students, lecturers and companies, and consists of four functional areas defined according to the platform operational requirements. A working prototype of the platform was developed using the Moodle learning management system and its core tools to determine its applicability and possible enhancement requirements. In the next stages of the project some additional tools like a knowledge base and the integration of the partners’ learning management systems to form the logistics knowledge cluster will be implemented. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The relevance of the research topic is associated with the active influence of the Internet on all areas of economy, politics and social life, emergence and development of a new electronic economy. Along with fundamental factors, the development of e-commerce is accelerated by the current negative trends in Russia and in all countries of the world connected with the pandemic of the coronavirus infection, which negatively influences many industries and entire sectors of the economy. The object of this study is e-trading in Russia and the key aspects affecting its functioning. The main goal of the first stage of the comprehensive study is to analyze the current state of the e-trading market, assess risks and potential development opportunities of models and the market as a whole. The article presents the results of the statistical analysis of the time series of e-trading, as well as some data of the econometric analysis. The results of the correlation and regression analysis help us determine the relationship between the GDP, retail and e-trading; correlation, elasticity and β-coefficients were calculated. The article shows preliminary calculations of the forecast dynamics of e-trading. The concept and content analyses were carried out to systematize international best practices and modern domestic practices of developing information technologies in the field of e-commerce. Due to the factor analysis the article discusses factors affecting e-trading. The author conducted the primary factor selection in relation to the development conditions of the e-commerce market and its segments. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The study is aimed at expanding the scientific discussion about the factors of investment efficiency in regional (Russia) and sectoral (processing industry) projections. The paper presents the results of the research on the process of investing into innovations of the Russian processing industry (sample of 2009–2017). The factors of economic efficiency have been identified for investment industrial projects. The theoretical statement was formulated that in today’s economy, innovation investment efficiency is not determined that much by the internal potential of the enterprise and the infrastructure it is surrounded with (however, their significance in the balance of potentials is not denied), but rather by external, market factors - industry consolidation ratio on the platform of new technology innovation. The identified nature of innovation investment efficiency is considered as a new research statement, which has objective limitations: region- and industry-specific ones. The practical side of the obtained result can be formulated as a criterion for selecting industries (markets, lines of business) for investing into innovations by enterprises of the processing industry. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

The key factors that determine the problem field for improving energy efficiency of enterprises are identified. The feasibility of enhancing innovation to characterize the tasks of improving energy efficiency and its main provisions from the perspective of organizational and economic features is described. The specifics of large business as an entity generating innovations is presented. This allowed us to characterize the strategic orientation of innovation and the relationship of factors in the formation of an innovation management system in the field of energy-efficient technologies. Peculiarities of carrying out activities under the conditions of multi-design as a factor complicating the management of innovations at large enterprises are considered. Identified areas of interdependence of projects within the innovation portfolio. The requirements for monitoring indicators are formulated based on the results of management procedures, and a system of estimated indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of innovative activities of large enterprises is proposed. Problem places in the implementation of innovative activities in the field of energy-efficient technologies are identified. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The modern technical level already allows us to build small crewless ships. Today, more than 60 models of such vessels are known to be developed. However, usually the scientific literature describes the development of elements, mechanisms and intelligent control systems, but studies on the assessment of trends and development tendencies of autonomous shipping means by analyzing patent literature have not been identified. This paper presents the results of a thematic search for titles of protection (applications, patents for inventions and utility models, certificates for computer programs) in relation to autonomous shipping means. As a result, applications and patents for inventions/utility models, as well as registered certificates for computer programs, were identified. The analysis of existing solutions on the sources of patent information for the further study of the technical level of autonomous navigation means is carried out. Over 70% of applications have been submitted in the last 2 years. It was confirmed that the market of autonomous small vessels and vessels under the operator’s control is actively developing. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={In this paper, we have discussed about the development of a soil moisture sensor, integrated with GPS and cloud that can be utilized for several applications such as irrigation management wastewater reclamation. Soil moisture plays vital role in plant growth and provides them nutrients. Therefore, it is important to detect the soil moisture content for proper development of plants. This IoT project uses soil moisture sensor to notify the user when the soil gets too dry or too wet. This device is developed on Arduino platform and has the capability to communicate in a wireless manner with the other devices to provide the soil moisture value as well as the latitude and longitude of the installed location with the help of GPS module integrated with it. Sensor has been calibrated by measuring the ground truth gravimetric soil moisture. A total of 16 samples were taken for developing the relationship between gravimetric soil moisture and output voltage, whereas more samples were used to validate the developed relationship. A good correlation is also observed between the soil moisture evaluated with developed sensor and ground truth gravimetric soil moisture. The data can be logged into SD card, and the developed device has the capacity to share the data with any Arduino IoT cloud platform through which we can examine and control the data of the device. We used Internet of things, as it paved a new path toward enhancing technology and getting it on our finger tips. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Integrated water management by the basin principle using technological, economic and environmental non-linear criteria is proposed. The methodological basis of the approach is the sustainable development paradigm. In line with the conditions of sustainable development, the EU Directive provides development of river basin management plans, according to which a transition from spontaneity to controllability of the water use development and ecological improvement of state of water bodies is carried out. Technological criteria for supporting of water levels in reservoirs have been developed, economic criteria for the dynamics of water intake for various needs have been formalized, the ecological needs of water quality assessment during the washing of rivers from reservoirs are substantiated. Balance equations are given for controlling of water masses dynamics and spread of pollution. A pulse method is proposed within a combined control system for river washing for example of the Ingulets river basin. The scenario analysis of the optimal and existing flushing technologies for the river from the reservoir showed that the proposed technology has economic advantages. Necessary restrictions for environmental criteria are done. At the same time, the existing technology requires significantly larger volumes of water for flushing and does not meet environmental criteria during certain periods of flushing. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This growth has meant new devices are now supporting Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. Consequently, a new look at the current design of wireless communication systems is needed. Smart mobility concerns the massive movement of people and requires a complex infra-structure that produces a lot of data, creating new interesting challenges in terms of network management and data processing. In this paper, we address classic generations of mobile technology until the latest 5G implementation and its alternatives.

abstract={This paper introduces the development trend of coal industry up to 2019. Compares with the global coal consumption volume and policy requirements, it is concluded that in the future, the amount of coal power generation will still occupy the main position of gross generation. With the requirements of environmental protection and clean energy, coal industry will gradually upgrade into coal gasification processing cluster. After gasification, the fuel can be used in the combustion of gas turbine to generate power, so as to achieve the advantages of higher efficiency and lower pollution. At the same time, the combined fuel cell technology can directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy, which will become the ultimate goal of the transformation and upgrading of the coal power generation industry in the future. At present, the coal power generation group is actively exploring the production application and management decision-making of intelligent power plants. The CFD software can be fully used to simulate and calculate the malfunction of main equipment in the power plant, and help technicians to determine the transformation scheme and fault causes. Artificial intelligence analysis method can analyze the weight proportion of a large number of production data stored in the SIS system of the power plant according to target requirements, quickly get the cause of main equipment failure, and predict the operation data for 3 to 5 min. The upgraded DCS management system can become intelligent and centralized big data analysis system. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Smart traffic and information systems require the collection of traffic data from respective sensors for regulation of traffic. In this regard, surveillance cameras have been installed in monitoring and control of traffic in the last few years. Several studies are carried out in video surveillance technologies using image processing techniques for traffic management. Video processing of a traffic data obtained through surveillance cameras is an instance of applications for advance cautioning or data extraction for real-time analysis of vehicles. This paper presents a detailed review of vehicle detection and classification techniques and also discusses about different approaches detecting the vehicles in bad weather conditions. It also discusses about the datasets used for evaluating the proposed techniques in various studies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={China’s education system is constantly developing and changing, and the education system of colleges and universities (CAU) is also constantly developing and innovating, among which the construction of education management (EM) information has become a hot topic. The arrival of big data (BD) has triggered revolutions in all sectors of society. Information symmetry and shared exchange not only affect the traditional management model, but also stimulate higher education management to release more power. The goals and contents of university education management have undergone tremendous changes. The high efficiency in the era of BD requires the use of data management and more scientific and rational overall planning in university management. The purpose of this article is to analyze in depth the pros and cons of the era of BD and its impact on current university education management, and to study the path of university education management in the era of BD. This article surveyed 40 universities. In the context of the era of BD, in order to realize the construction and development of education management information, we need to combine the current BD technology and apply it to the management of various higher education. It was found that the fragmentation and asymmetry of education management information accounted for 35.4%. Only in this way can we achieve innovation and optimization of the education system. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images or text. Most traditional and common methods of image retrieval utilize some method of adding metadata such as captioning, keywords or descriptions to the images so that retrieval can be performed over the annotation words. Manual image annotation is time-consuming, laborious and expensive. To address this, there has been a large amount of research done on automatic image annotation. With the rapid development of information technology, the number of electronic documents and digital content within documents exceeds the capacity of manual control and management. The usage of images is increased in real time. So, the proposed system concentrates on retrieving image by using the text-based image retrieval system. Text documents are given as input to the preprocessing stage, and features are extracted using TF-IDF. Finally, document clustering method can be used to automatically group the retrieved documents into list of meaningful categories. Document clustering clusters the document of different domains and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics, and after that relevant documents are retrieved and then images of those relevant documents are retrieved. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={As informationization enters all aspects of people’s lives, China’s Internet has entered the era of industrial integration, and informationization and education have further integrated. The changing times brought about by information technology and related technological innovations are a huge challenge that must be faced by current university management courses, and also a major opportunity for the reform of university management courses. Management is a professional foundation course that usually starts in the first year. Students who have just entered the school lack a rational and emotional understanding of the rules of business management and the operation of the market economy. The purpose of this article is to study the informatization of management courses in colleges and universities, and analyze the information literacy training path for management students. In this regard, this paper discusses the realization of the informationization construction model of management courses. The program is based on the “people-oriented” principle to promote self-study and information literacy for management students. From the sample survey of 4,150 college students and graduate students in this paper, we can conclude that the construction of information technology in management courses will increase the interest of students by 10.4% and improve students’ autonomous learning ability. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The goal of the present innovation is to give engineering students an innovative educational experience through their natural engagement with mobile devices. It aims to motivate the integration of technology in the teaching-learning process where students design, develop and use a mobile app in order to build up knowledge in Thermodynamics. It also enhances their level of domain of soft skills such as teamwork, creativity, self-management, analytical, abstract and critical thinking. This work suggests the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to develop Open Educational Resources (OERs), which could be helpful in the teaching-learning process of Equilibrium Thermodynamics (ET). During 2016, chemical and biotechnology engineering students from ITESM CEM developed a mobile app to facilitate the comprehension of physicochemical phenomena of phase equilibria. Its design and implementation was the result of a four-step process: 1. Selection of the technologic platform; 2. Definition of thematic content; 3. Creative process for the design and information setup; and 4. Development of the app. Results of this study show quantitatively that implementing technology-based learning experiences as a learning tool has a positive impact on the educational performance and skills development of students. It was learnt that the student’s performance was influenced by the type of technology selected and promoted the development of distinct skills and the construction of knowledge in different levels of domain. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={A vote is considered as one of the most important legal rights a citizen can practice in a democratic country. Presently, votes are cast in two manners: manual mode, i.e., paper voting and the semi-manual mode using e-voting machine (EVM). Both systems require the accumulation of the voters in centralized voting booths. Several discrepancies arise due to the lack of security management in a centralized voting system. These can be avoided if a decentralized voting system can be implemented thereby providing a high-security impact. Blockchain is a technology that acts as a backbone for the highly secured parallel economy like the Bitcoin system. If this technology can be implemented as a security measure in a decentralized e-voting system, this will ensure the total security and authenticity of the voting system. In this paper, an endeavor has been made to design a blockchain-based e-voting system. Initial experimentation displayed satisfactory prospects of the system. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Agricultural product sales is an integrated business process. In this process, agricultural product producers and operators exchange consumer needs in order to achieve their business goals in a constantly changing market environment. Intelligent search in e-commerce uses information as a carrier to realize the digital management of economic activities. China’s intelligent search for agricultural products is still imperfect. In this regard, this article studies agricultural marketing under intelligent search. The literature analysis method adopted in this article will be carried through the whole process. Perform a SWOT analysis of the Chinese agricultural product market through intelligent search to identify existing problems and propose countermeasures. It can be seen from the data that 50–90% of the fresh agricultural products consumed in large and medium-sized cities are provided through wholesale markets. Agricultural product marketing can only effectively use modern information technology to capture consumer demand information in a rapidly changing market. And provide consumers with appropriate agricultural products in an appropriate manner. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Since the beginning of the 21st century, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology at home and abroad has caused people’s work and life to change gradually. People are transitioning from the information age to the smart age. Whether private universities can catch up with the limited express train of the “era of artificial intelligence”, improve their teaching management methods, improve teaching quality, improve the overall competitiveness of the school, and provide more outstanding talents to the society is an important issue. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to discuss the research on teaching management reform of private universities based on artificial intelligence. In this paper, through case analysis and interview analysis, a detailed analysis of the teaching management reform environment of private colleges and universities. The survey found that from 2013 to 2018, the average growth rate of private universities reached 6.5%. The case analysis method and interview method are used to analyze the current situation of artificial intelligence technology and private universities, as well as the idea of applying artificial intelligence technology to the teaching management of private universities to improve the teaching quality of private universities. Suggestions for teaching and improving the level of running a school are put forward. Study the reform and practical exploration of artificial intelligence in teaching management to promote and ensure the development of teaching management. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Due to the characteristics of public goods, there are many problems in the process of providing public goods, such as information asymmetry, adverse selection and moral hazard, which lead to the low efficiency of public goods supply. By introducing information and communication technology into the theoretical model of public goods, this paper discusses the impact of information technology on the efficiency of public goods provided by the government. The research of this paper finds that the introduction of big data technology can eliminate the information asymmetry between the government and citizens, the means of Internet information disclosure can eliminate the adverse selection and moral hazard in the construction of public goods, the use of information and communication technology among government organizations can coordinate the contradictions between governments, and the interaction of the above three factors improves the public goods Supply efficiency. This conclusion can provide policy suggestions for the government to improve the supply efficiency of public goods to a certain extent. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={A systematic review was conducted and a number of original results were presented, which are not exhaustive in the study of mathematical models of formation and functioning of members of software development teams using cloud technology. However, they reflect the general methodology of construction and study of applied mathematical models of dynamic functioning of firm’s developers of software systems, and also can be effectively used in solving problems of wide class of management of social and economic systems. From the point of view of the theory of research of mathematical models it is necessary to recognize that various results of research of commands of developers of the program systems received in psychology and sociology, today in formal models find insufficiently full reflection. For many models, there are certain difficulties in obtaining analytical solutions. For example, such a common in practice class of formation and existence of teams, taking into account the psychological of each team member in program engineering teams, is not yet a subject of deep systemic, formal, theoretical research. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Overcoming the problems of existing file storage and sharing approaches, this paper gives an efficient way of storing and sharing the files using blockchain and smart contracts. As an example, Managing student’s information and sharing them or giving access to unauthorized people in a much secured way is one of the major responsibilities of any university or organization. Instead of storing the certificates in a normal database, blockchain technology can be used to store the certificates. In our approach, the certificates and other documents will be uploaded to the blockchain and will be shared securely when any third party needs to access the certificates. The university administrator has ultimate rights to upload student’s certificates and managing them. Students can view their documents and certificates; other unauthorized people (third party/organization/employer/others) can access the files after taking permission of the college administrator. These types of approaches are very useful in this era where efficient storage and sharing the files plays a crucial role. The feature which differentiates our approach of certificate management system from existing certificate management system is, our system is decentralized, cryptographically secure, immutable and efficient. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The urban landscape design project is an important project for the construction of modern cities in China and an important part of urban ecological greening. Strengthening the planning and design of urban landscapes is not only a need for ecological construction, but also an objective requirement for improving the taste of residents’ lives. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the R&D and implementation of BIM technology has gradually involved many industries, including architectural design, construction, and business operations, and the landscape industry is no exception. With the application of BIM technology, it can effectively reduce cost calculation errors and drawing calculation errors. Compared with other engineering construction industries, the development of BIM technology in the landscape gardening industry is relatively slow. At the same time, due to the characteristics of landscape gardening, the application of BIM technology has certain difficulties. This article will discuss the application of BIM technology in landscape engineering projects. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Ecological green has become the basic national policy in China. Green buildings are springing up in large numbers, but there are few corresponding solutions. In view of the characteristics of various complex data produced by the green building complex with many business forms and green technologies, and the difficulty of unified management and control, this paper proposes to establish a two-level distributed database to deal with the heterogeneous data and adopt the method of service data object-based middleware and data warehouse to deal with the data. According to the response requirements and data requirements of different functions of the platform, data fusion is performed in different ways. Query speed of data is optimized. And then reach the unified management of green building complex. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Digital transformation is a key driver for Industry 4.0 and converts production and logistics into a digitalized, interconnected, intelligent factory and supply chain. Associated technical developments are resulting in an enormous change in the requirements for employee competencies. Despite increasing automation, workforces and their skills are still of great importance for the successful utilization of innovative technologies. Until now, current research has scarcely focused on upcoming changes in technology-specific competencies due to digitalization and automation in logistics. The aim of this paper is to identify the competency requirements by means of semi-structured interviews with technology providers. The analysis indicates that demands for competencies change based on the use of hardware and software products. The paper identifies future relevant competencies and requirements for logistics employees so that Industry 4.0 technologies can be exploited. By analyzing changes in competencies, demands for qualifications and appropriate development and training for employees can be derived. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Digital identity plays the main role in the digital world. Thus, many researchers emphasize the determination of the accurate identity of users. This paper proposes the blockchain-based digital identity management system in Myanmar, to decrease the use of national identity document. The occurrence of duplicated identity numbers in Myanmar is the main issue, and another problem is how to recover the lost national identity card. Trusted humans and organizations that have the responsibility for the entire activity need secure data management. Blockchain technology built on the internet could use current identity data in a peer-to-peer, interoperable way to eliminate third parties. Using the benefit of blockchain, the unique and persistent identity number of the citizen will be stored in the blockchain network. The user could store encrypted private, personal, and sensitive data, as well as share verifications about the information on the blockchain. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Human resource practitioners are increasingly interested in social networks as a way to strengthen relationships among employees, to improve efficiency of project teams, to better understand information flow within company, and, finally, to be able to respond to modern demands in company’s human capital management. Identification of leaders in fields, dynamics of communities, and its influence to overall organization performance can be supported and guided using technology. This paper offers a framework for establishing interactive measurement tool inside medium to large organization (500 + employees) conceptualizing different types of network theory metrics and uses case examples to identify outcomes typically associated with each division, team, or group of employees. Human capital evaluation is a challenging task and one of the key points in modern organizations, facing millennial workforce and constant turbulence on talent feed. Network analysis is a science approach that uses various data models and advanced visualization to represent the structure of relationships between people, organizations, goals, interests, and other entities within organization. In this article, we describe how network theory applied in the form of organizational network analysis (ONA) can be used as an interdisciplinary concept for managing human capital in large organization together with framework and how to build interactive HR support dashboard following core network theory concepts and its adaptation to management-friendly tool. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) enables exchanging of various entities like smart health, smart industry, and smart home development. These systems have already gained popularity and are still increasing day by day. Moving ahead, we foster to develop a ubiquitous transport system with the help of IoT sensors technology. A new diversity leads to the introduction of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV facilitates communication between vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-sensors, and vehicle-to-roadside unit. With the help of artificial intelligence, IoV forms a solid backbone for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) which gives further insight to the technologies that better explain traffic efficiency and their management applications. In this article, a novel approach towards architecture model, framework, cross-level interaction, applications and challenges of IoV are discussed in the context of ITS and future vehicular scenario. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={These days by a high increase in the amount of computation and big data gathering and analysis, everybody needs more resources. Buying more computational and storage resources are so expensive. However, cloud computing solved this problem by providing a “pay as you go” plans therefor, users will only pay for resources that they used. However, using this technology has its challenges. One of them is resource management, which is focusing on the methodologies of dedicating resources to the users with the minimum of waste. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware resource management technique, using the concepts of both joint VM and container consolidation approach and deep Q-Learning algorithm for green computing in cloud data centers in order to minimize the waste of resources, migration rate, and energy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Advancement in the modern healthcare system is inevitable because of the growing need for healthcare services and care units. Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a new discipline that can improve the quality of caregiving by making the environment context-aware and cognitive. To facilitate behavioral tracking and real-time activity monitoring of patient health conditions, AAL environment is developed. To facilitate independent living and personalized health care, wireless body area network (WBAN) is introduced. Due to the increase in the demand for personalized health care, the current infrastructure is not scalable and managing the network of connected devices is challenging. So in this paper, a novel approach for traffic management with software-defined networking (SDN) technology is presented. To handle a huge volume of dynamic data collected for the body area network and the surrounding are processed and routed intelligently by the SDN controller. The SDN controller monitors the traffic flows and exchanges traffic flow rules to the sensors, wearable, and other devices for managing mobility and routing. The proposed traffic management method can deliver improved performance and ensures reliability, mobility, and scalability. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={The issues of applying the knowledge system for managing innovative projects and programs to stimulate and improve innovation in Ukraine by analyzing the causes of weak innovation development and finding ways to improve this state are considered. The main directions of innovation activities of domestic enterprises, the reasons for failures to bring new products to the market are identified and analyzed. The types of innovations that are used for innovation activities in IT enterprises are highlighted. It is pointed out that the project approach to innovation is almost completely absent. At the same time, it is noted that traditional project management methodologies based on value systems do not fully allow us to effective management of innovative projects due to their significant complexity and risk. This leads to the need to find new approaches that would take into account the specifics of complex innovative projects and development programs, their elements, characteristics and parameters of connections. The issues of development and application of new models of innovative project management based on the value approach are considered. To do this, it is proposed to use a model of scientific cooperation based on franchising in terms of maximizing the values of all stakeholders of the project and the program, based on a comprehensive system approach to determining the state of activity in an innovative project. A structural scheme of interaction with the external environment in the implementation of innovative projects is proposed, which is a conceptual model of research. Based on this model and the scheme of innovative association, a mathematical model is proposed for determining the values of participants and stakeholders of an innovative project or program at all stages of functional interaction within the framework of the initiated project activity. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={The content management method is proposed as a stage of its life cycle, which is based on the application of fuzzy logic. This method describes the processes of generating commercial information resources and simplifies content management technology. The article describes the methods and procedures for forming design decisions in the management of commercial web-projects and some characteristics of the project are incomplete and inaccurate. The analysis of the main factors of project decision making is carried out, the reasons and nature of occurrence of incompleteness and inaccuracy of design characteristics were determined. The proposed method makes it possible to create tools for processing web-resources and implement the content management subsystem. Procedures for reducing the level of incompleteness and inaccuracy of project characteristics based on fuzzy logic have developed. Content management tasks are formation and rotation of operational and retrospective databases; personalization of users’ work, saving personal requests of users and sources, keeping statistics of work; providing search in databases; generation of initial forms; information interaction with other databases; formation and development of a web-resource. The content management subsystem is implemented by caching it or information blocks. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Scientometrics deals with analyzing and quantifying works in science, technology, and innovation. It is a study that focuses on quality rather than quantity. The journals are evaluated against several different metrics such as the impact of the journals, scientific citation, SJR, SNIP indicators as well as the indicators used in policy and management context. The practice of using journal metrics for evaluation involves handling a large volume of data to derive useful patterns and conclusions. These metrics play an important role in the measurement and evaluation of research performance. Due to the fact that most metrics are being manipulated and abused, it becomes essential to judge and evaluate a journal by using a single metric or a reduced set of significant metrics. We propose l1-norm singular value decomposition (l1-SVD) to efficiently solve this problem. We evaluate our method to study the emergence of a new journal, Astronomy and Computing, by comparing it with 46,000 journals chosen from the fields of computing, informatics, astronomy, and astrophysics. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Web content management systems, referred here as CMS, is a customizable software platform on which websites can be easily built. According to Web Technology Surveys, more than 55% of websites on the Internet use any one of the many popular CMS platforms [1]. Their popularity arises due to ease of use, capability to customize, and ability to abstract complex programming layers into a very simple user interface, especially for a novice user. However, while the user may have very little or no knowledge of the backend database system containing sensitive information, this platform offers itself as an easy target to ever-expanding malware threats. In this paper, we explore and analyze in depth of one such malware, focusing on the origin of the attack, its deployment, its regenerating methods, and the cost of combating and retrieving the compromised data. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={The information technology of decision support and monitoring in distributed man-machine systems for managing complex technical objects of critical application is proposed, which complements the theory and methods for solving the problems of increasing the functional sustainability and efficiency of the operational management of the working modes, due to introducing the complex of modern monitoring, evaluation, and analysis means and making relevant decisions to ensure trouble-free operation. The development of this information technology on the example of management of a multilevel regional electrical power network is considered. In calculating the criteria characterizing the degree of workability and technical condition of the electrical power network equipment, in addition to the data obtained from control devices of the monitoring system and diagnostic modules, modern mathematical probabilistic methods and fuzzy models based on the theory of expert evaluation were used. To evaluate the modes of operation, and maintain the full functional sustainability of the regional power network, a Bayesian confidence network was built, with the help of which, based on the experts’ knowledge, the probability of the state of both individual components and a complex evaluation of its functioning were performed. For practical substantiation of the obtained results, an experiment was conducted, the results of which confirmed the practical value of the proposed information technology, which can be used in distributed man-machine systems for managing complex technical objects of critical application. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Financial Sharing breaks through the boundaries of time and space, and realizes the centralized management and information sharing of enterprise finance. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of computer network technology in enterprise financial file sharing. Firstly, we have a deep understanding of the definition of shared services and financial shared services. Secondly, we have discussed the characteristics of enterprise accounting electronic file management under the financial sharing mode from the aspects of convenience, real-time and efficiency. After studying the cloud computing model and data security architecture, we have established the enterprise financial file sharing information system. The experimental results show that all data blocks of the data file are assumed to be average Stored on different nodes of the same rack, when the number of nodes is 1, the construction of hierarchical hash tree can also be regarded as the file hash tree of data files that hash all data blocks of data files, which is the same as the construction of hierarchical hash tree without. When the data file is deleted, modified and inserted, the construction of hierarchical hash tree is more time-saving than that of unstructured hash tree. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={A close investigation is required on the fundamental instruments of an establishments’ big data analytics usage. This research paper mainly addresses how is an organizations’ value creation affected due to big data analytics usage, what is big data analytics, and what are its key antecedents in an organization to understand the aspects that influence the actual usage of big data analytics. Hence, the technology, organization, and environment framework are used. The review data collected from Indian founded corporations confirm that: organizational value creation is significantly affected by big data analytics usage in that organization; organizational BDA usage is indirectly influenced by environmental factors, technological factors, and organizational factors through top management support. Collectively, this research study will guide the business managers on the usage of big data analytics, and a theory-based comprehensive analysis of big data analytics usage and its key antecedents. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={In the process of urbanization, the number of construction projects is increasing, so it is necessary to optimize the design of project management. A project management method based on BIM is proposed. The fuzzy balanced scheduling method is used to optimize and cluster the information data of the construction project, and the parameterized identification model is used for the adaptive configuration of the construction project in the whole life cycle process. The dynamic data analysis model of project management is constructed by using 3D rendering method, the basic data of project management is obtained by using BIM technology, and the adaptive query and configuration of project management data is realized by database optimization access technology. Improve the artificial intelligence of project management. The simulation results show that the model has good retrieval ability and high efficiency of database access to the relevant information data of the project, and the intelligent level of project management is improved. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Including human, technological, organizational, and natural resources, contemporary cities represent an urban reflection of civilization development. The globalization and competitiveness have shaped cities commercially, politically, socially, and in terms of their design and growth. Looking for the new urban patterns that could meet the global challenges, culture was recently recognized, as an indispensable part of the sustainability, and the significant pillar for grounding the Smart City initiatives. The management of cultural heritage is a significant factor for recognization, definition, and affirmation of cultural identity. Given that technology primarily enhances the urban infrastructure, the management of built heritage is significant within the Smart City development paradigm. For this paper, in the decision-making process, indicators related to the management of the cultural built heritage are divided into six groups: governing, economic, social, environmental, technological, and architectural factors. The paper aims to identify priority indicators, as necessary in the further development of heritage management, using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Interval Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) methods. The isolation of dominant indicators should enable a more precise definition of future activities and measures. The application of these methods should address the extent to which differences in fuzzy and interval grading approaches may affect the final ranking. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The fourth party logistics (4PLs) is an integrator that assembles the resources, capabilities, and technology of the service provider and its client to design, develop, and implement comprehensive supply chain solutions. A 4PLs provider is a technological service provider who owns computer systems and intellectual capital. Choosing the best 4PLs among many alternatives is critical for the firms and it can be considered in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems and includes subjectivity and vagueness data. Fuzzy sets theory is a useful tool to handle such subjectivity and vagueness in the evaluation process. Recently, some extensions of fuzzy sets have been developed to define the uncertainty more comprehensively. Neutrosophic sets are one of the extensions of the fuzzy sets, which, unlike the other extensions, utilizes independent indeterminacy-membership function, thereby extracts significant information and enhances the accuracy of the decision-making process. In this paper, we proposed a neutrosophic MCDM method to evaluate the 4PLs providers’ performance. In the application section, three experts applied neutrosophic linguistic scale to the providers’ performance. Then we calculated the closeness coefficient of each provider and ranked them in descending order. The results pointed out that the proposed neutrosophic MCDM method can be effectively used in 4PLs providers’ performance evaluation problems. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The value of data is gaining importance in recent years both in Turkey and globally through increase data production. As data began to gain importance, data mining began to change and evolve. With help of data mining, companies started to determine their customer management strategies based on intelligent data analysis. Literature reviews in this area show that many data analysis models studied in the field of customer management. When a more detailed literature review is made, it is observed that the number of sources where demand estimation and location analysis applied together with the machine learning algorithms is very low in all sectors and almost none in the shopping mall. Within the scope of this study, a new model has been developed by combining location analysis and demand forecasting models that will estimate the number of customers for shopping malls in order to overcome this deficiency in the literature. This model was strengthened with estimation algorithms and tested to generalize this model to all shopping malls. In this study conducted through a large-scale technology and communications services provider company, it was found that environmental factors had a significant effect on the number of customers going to shopping centers. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Digitalization arising with advancements in technologies offers immense opportunities for the supply chain. The digitalization provides raised value creation and productivity advantages in terms of optimized processes and systems, better resource management, and smarter supply chains. Therefore, with digitalization, organizations consider the adoption of sustainable practices in their supply chains as both a competitive advantage and a necessity for long-term survival. However, the development and implementation of sustainable supply chains include many risks, largely due to the existence of several risks such as economic, technological, political, social, and the lack of resources. Sustainable supply chains in a digital environment are an important issue that needs to be addressed due to these risks. This study is to examine the risks towards the advancement of technology more closely on sustainable supply chain environments. The aim is to create a model that evaluates the risks that can be encountered under the digitalization perspective of the sustainable supply chain. Firstly, in this study, the main and sub-criteria of the risk assessment model are determined by a comprehensive literature review and experts’ opinion. Subsequently, the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IVPF-AHP) method is used to evaluate the related risks arising in the sustainable supply chain with digitalization. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In this paper, a fuzzy inference system for managing an installed on a building micro grid PV systems is presented. The software system manages a PV/battery micro grid-connected system and uses fuzzy mapping of three input variables: power produced by PV panels, power in the battery and consumed power. The output of the FIS, obtained after applying the fuzzy rules, is a decision for choosing which power source is to be used. This research is part of a project for optimizing the energy consumption of a building with the use of independent alternative renewable energy sources. The input test data for the optimization are the amount of used energy for lighting, heating, computers power supply and other needs of one particular building (the building of Burgas Free University) and the corresponding price of each of the used energy sources (This research is funded by National Research Fund of Bulgaria under Contract No. KP-06-COST-8/06.08.2019 for providing national co-financing for the participation of Bulgarian teams in approved actions under the European program for cooperation in the field of research and technology COST under the project “Characteristics prediction and optimization of a photovoltaic system with artificial intelligence methods”.). © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Computer networks are becoming more complex in the number of connected nodes and the amount of traffic. The growing number and increasing complexity of cyber-attacks makes network management and security a challenge. Software defined networks (SDN) technology is a solution that aims for efficient and flexible network management. The SDN controller(s) plays an important role in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks. In this study, a flow-based anomaly detection system running on the POX controller is designed. A comparative analysis of the supervised machine algorithms is given to choose the optimum anomaly detection method in SDN based networks. NSL-KDD dataset is used for training and testing of the classifiers. The results show that machine learning algorithms have great potential in the success of flow-based anomaly detection systems in the SDN infrastructure. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={A smart city is an urban area that uses data collected from citizens, devices, and assets to manage resources efficiently. It can be argued that autonomous cars will spread related to this concept. However, the implementation and adaptation of the autonomous cars is a complex process due to human factors and traffic. Therefore, it is expected that autonomous vehicle (AV) will find its place first in the heavy transportation as it is more cost efficient and easier to adapt. In order to adapt intercity transportation routes to autonomous trucks, an investment should be made on Information and Communications Technology such as sensors and cameras connected to the network with Internet of Things. In this study, the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem for road selection for autonomous trucks in Turkey is examined. Although self-driving trucks are not yet introduced, this study aims to pioneer by examining truck roads in between industrial areas and decide which road would be better fit to start an autonomous truck investment. As there are many uncertainties in the nature of this decision, the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method will be used for decision-making. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={An electromyography signal (EMG) is known as a record of the action potentials that are produced by the human brain with the intention of activating or deactivating the skeletal area muscles. These signals are considered very important within the biomedical area because they contain information on muscle contraction and relaxation, which can be used in various areas. The EMG signals recognition and classification are a subject very studied within the scientific community for its various applications such as prosthesis management, virtual environment control, bio-robotics, etc. An EMG signals classification system fulfills four stages corresponding to the acquisition, preprocessing, processing and classification. In this system, last three stages, algorithms are used that in principle allow minimizing the interference produced in the acquisition of this type of signals, in second, they correctly extract the information or characteristics of the same signals, and in third, they allow to use techniques that allow classification in the best way the EMG signals. As technology advances, new needs emerge, day by day EMG recognition systems are in need of improvement, so new techniques are proposed that improve the processing and classification of these types of signals, but from the same In this way, these techniques require a higher computing cost that allows each one of the stages mentioned above to be fulfilled in the best way possible. Therefore, this article proposes a low-cost embedded system that allows EMG signals to be recognized and classified, as a signal acquisition technique, it is proposed to use a multi-channel high precision system acquisition, and for the preprocessing, processing and classification stages, it is proposed to use a high-performance, low-cost microcontroller such as the ARM cortex M4. The proposal in general aims to create a system of recognition and classification of EMG signal that can be used in different areas of biomedicine such as the design of prostheses, but with the particularity of an embedded system of high computational range and low cost, this will allow using the algorithms that emerge day by day to improve the recognition and classification of EMG signals. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The demand for agricultural products for export is increasing every year. Thus, there is a need for a traceable and more communicative agricultural supply chain among its stakeholders. In addition, the increase in controls, verifications and communications in each SC agent makes agility and chain difficult, generating distrust among those involved. To overcome this issue, we consider Blockchain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology to decentralize data with this state-of-the-art technology, we develop a model that solves the traceability problem of the agricultural product. The model also improves transparency and security within the SC, increasing trust between the suppliers, collaborators and consumers. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In response to the weak environmental infrastructure of Antarctic greenhouses, the inability to automate operation and low reliability, a remote monitoring platform for the Antarctic greenhouse was developed, which integrates functions such as database management, image acquisition and remote data communication. An infrared high-resolution and high-speed digital camera was used in the greenhouses and with its cradle head; it is convenient to monitor the scene in 360°. The monitory software was developed using the SDK provided by the manufacturer to realize the functions of image displaying, capturing and console control. Furthermore, a communication software module was developed to transfer operational data and image files from Antarctic greenhouse to data center in Shanghai, China. The entity–relationship model was adopted for database designing, and the SQL Server database was used for data storing. And after a common communication protocol was studied for transferring database tables and image files, a flow chart of communication was designed, and separate threads were used for the transfer of image files to improve the efficiency. Using the socket technology to transfer the operational data and image files to the data center of Shanghai, people could obtain environmental parameters, running status and the information of plant images in the greenhouse. After the system was installed in the greenhouse of the Great Wall Station in Antarctica, it realized the remote monitoring of the crop’s growth in the greenhouse. The operational data showed that the system works stably, and the transmission of data is accurate, providing a guarantee for the operation of the greenhouses in Antarctica. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In SDN network environment, how to use multi-mode communication technology to ensure timely recovery of services in the event of a network link failure has become a key issue in the field of power communication network service management. In order to solve this problem, this paper first analyzes the factors affecting the power companies revenue and business recovery ability from the two characteristics of network characteristics and business importance and constructs the value of the smart grid business risk, which includes three indicators of network channel quality, network link failure probability, and business importance. Secondly, the smart grid service recovery algorithm with maximization of revenue is proposed. The algorithm includes three subprocesses: fault perception, computing smart grid service recovery priority, and recovery of smart grid service based on priority. Finally, through simulation experiments, compared with related algorithms, it is verified that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the revenue of power communication network and the recovery ability of smart grid service. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The existing intelligent tutoring still follows the traditional classroom teaching mode, with knowledge point as the center, which emphasizes the transfer of knowledge and neglects the problem-solving ability training. Problem-based learning can effectively solve the dilemma of the above teaching mode, but the existing intelligent tutoring technology still does not support it. To this end, this paper puts forward a new idea of problem-based intelligent tutoring and carries out the theoretical analysis about its computational feasibility. Firstly, we make a deep analysis about the cognitive activities of human teachers in the process of problem-based learning and abstract out the core elements in this process from the four aspects of concept, relationship, operation and control. After that, by using these core elements, we give an abstract description about the teachers’ cognitive process in the problem tutoring situation, so as to complete the construction of the cognitive model for problem-based tutoring. Based on this cognitive model, we firstly make the formal definitions about all of the conceptual and relational elements, then analyze the control schemes and the functional requirements about the operational elements completely, lastly use the pseudocode to describe the complete algorithm implementations of these operations. All of the above formal specifications about the concepts, relations and operations make up the computational model for problem-based tutoring, which lays the foundation for the system design and development int the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Through analyzing the relationship among innovation network characteristics, enterprise absorptive capacity and relationship learning, this study constructs a theoretical model about the impact of enterprise innovation network characteristics on relationship learning, and further introduces absorptive capacity as a mediating variable to discuss the mechanism among them. Based on a sample data of 205 questionnaires, the empirical results show that the relationship strength and relationship quality of enterprise innovation network characteristics have positive impact on relationship learning. Three dimensions of absorptive capacity, namely, knowledge acquisition capacity, knowledge digestion capacity and knowledge application capacity, have positive effects on relationship learning. Among the characteristics of enterprise innovation network, network size, network centrality and relationship quality have positive influence on absorptive capacity of enterprises. Knowledge acquisition capacity, knowledge digestion capacity and knowledge application capacity play a partial mediating role in the influence of relationship strength and relationship quality on relationship learning. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={At present, private enterprises in Sichuan Province of China are confronted with the problem of “weak in innovation and lack of stamina”. The studies on research and development (R&D) Investment of technology-intensive enterprises is of great significance in terms of optimizing the industrial structure of Sichuan Province and promoting innovation of private economy. First of all, this paper built up a model of innovation chain with R&D investment as the core through theoretical analysis; secondly, CDZS Software Company Limited, a technology-intensive private enterprise in Southwest China, was selected as the research subject; thirdly, the innovation investment of CDZS Software Company Limited was studied through descriptive and statistical analysis. Finally, the basic path of technology-intensive enterprises in R&D investment is obtained through data analysis, and the feasibility of “innovation chain theory with R&D investment as the core” was verified. From a theoretical perspective, this paper contributed to the literature on “innovation chain” and “R&D investment of technology-intensive enterprises” at a micro-level. From a practical perspective, this paper provided a reference for government’s decision-making of R&D investment activities, which is helpful in terms of improving independent innovation abilities of technology-intensive private enterprises in Sichuan Province. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Threat Intelligence is evidence-based knowledge that helps to understand, predict and adapt the behavior of an existing or emerging threats. Threat Intelligence can be used to decide on the subject’s response to its threat. Several components provide information about threats. Online Malware Scanners (OMS) are part of the general threat intelligence that the entire system can provide when searching for files, URLs, hashes, CVEs, IP addresses and domain names. Among other industrial technologies, threat intelligence has also proven its importance to reduce the human effort in detection, prevention and analysis of a malware. The paper covers the comparative analysis of OMS that would assist the industrial research and development (R&D) teams, cybersecurity researchers and students to decide the best suitable OMS for their deployed cyber physical systems in order to efficiently automate the whole process of threat intelligence and ultimately reducing the impact of external attacks on the overall cyber infrastructure of industrial organizations. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Innovation is a primary driving force for development and a strong guarantee for sustainable competition of corporations. Taking listed companies in China’s information technology and software service industry from 2008 to 2018 as a sample, this paper aims to examine the influence of technical executives on the innovation performance of companies and to test the moderating role of executive shareholding. We collect data through the combination of database and manual collection. The empirical results are as follows: 1. Technical executives have simultaneously improved the quantity and quality of corporate innovation output. 2. Executive shareholding weakens the influence of technology executives on the quantity and quality of innovation output. On this basis, we propose policy recommendations about making more efforts to introduce and train executives with technical background, and strengthening the supervision and management of the equity motivating. This paper enriches relevant research on managers’ characteristics and innovation performance and provides certain policy guidance programs for relevant decision makers. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays, maintenance management is changing due to the new technologies in inspection and monitorization systems to reduce the production costs for the companies and risks for the operator. Maintenance management is a key factor in some industries as renewable energy, due to the high-cost consequences of a wrong failure detection in a wind turbine. Therefore, advances in condition monitoring systems are required for an early failure diagnosis. This paper contributes to the actual wind turbines diagnosis methods with a novel non-destructive inspection system based on acoustic analysis of the wind turbine condition. The paper presents a condition monitoring system based on an acoustic sensor embedded in an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect acoustic signals emitted by the wind turbine. The signals are sent to a ground remote-control centre, and then they are analysed. This data acquisition system needs of a qualitative and quantitative analysis to classify and identify the condition of the wind turbine. Wavelet transforms are employed for filtering the signals and pattern recognition. Several scenarios are considered and analysed considering the main mechanical parts and components of a wind turbine. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Under the current fierce market competition, the two themes of strategic flexibility and business model innovation have become more and more important for enterprises to participate in competition, their importance in the process of enterprise strategic management has also increased. Based on this, the paper will deeply study the influence mechanism of strategic flexibility on business model innovation. Firstly, we conduct a review study on relevant literature, and then carry out empirical analysis based on the questionnaire data of enterprise research. Research shows that: 1) Strategic flexibility has a positive impact on business model innovation; 2) Dual innovation plays a mediating role in the relationship between strategic flexibility and business model innovation; 3) Environmental dynamics have a positive moderating effect on the impact of resource flexibility which is a kind of strategic flexibility on business model innovation. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a wireless technology adopted by the research community to implement smart transportation applications. Due to the variation in the vehicular speed, topology in the VANET continuously changes that make a routing complex task. It is better to use the position-based routing protocol that is adaptive and mostly suitable for dynamically changing road environments. The objective of the paper is to analyze an impact of real mobility traces on position-based routing protocols using simulation. It is difficult to perform a simulation in the VANET due to the restricted movement of vehicles. Vehicular mobility plays a major role in the VANET. Realistic mobility traces such as intelligent driver model-intersection management (IDM-IM), IDM–lane changing (LC) and ManhattanGrid are generated using VANETMobiSim and Bonnmotion tool. These traces are applied to the intersection-based routing (IBR), greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) and ant colony optimization-intersection-based routing (ACO-IBR). The impact of the mobility traces has been evaluated with parameters such as delay, throughput and successful delivery ratio (SDR). The result shows that the selection of proper mobility pattern is a key to achieve the realistic performance of the simulation. ACO-IBR minimizes delay and produces better successful delivery ratio and throughput for all real mobility patterns. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={This study sheds light on how the knowledge management (KM) revolution contributed in evolving the governmental performance in Bahrain since few decades. The study was essential to contribute to the limited literature and establish possible contributions that KM has made in the government sector in Bahrain. Hence, a quantitative research followed an adopted survey; piloted through a non-structured in-depth interview, for testing the credibility of this study’s adopted framework. The collected data was analyzed and revealed that KM in Bahrain was at 50%, though such initiatives significantly affect innovation. In terms of responsiveness, this study found out that those who recorded less information retrieval time had also recorded a high maturity level, and that KM was found to be significant in supporting Bahrain vision 2030. In this vein, the study revealed a strong correlation between competitiveness and KM, since KM enhances management of human capital, vital for Bahrain’s economy. Precisely, the study confirmed that a knowledge creation and management lead to economic transformation from the traditional to a knowledge-based sector. Study recommendations aim for the government to plan for the upcoming organizations amidst stiff competition. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Nowadays a huge number of different devices and sensors generate information of every type. The data collected, even from long distances, can be used to support decision making, prevent losses and maximize asset utilization rates. Thus, the possibility to track assets is getting attention and raising interest worldwide. The heterogeneity of such sensors as well as the multitude of different application fields led to the development of new communication protocols, network technologies and low-power connected devices. This wide range of possibilities introduces the need to integrate in a unique platform the provisioning and management of different device types as well as data ingestion mechanisms, ensuring security and data segregation. Moreover, the need to accommodate the growing demand to provide ready-to-use solutions is leading to the development of adapters and interoperable platforms that can communicate with each others. This paper presents an analysis of some of the most common wireless technologies used by low-power connected devices and describes a cloud-based platform that integrates different device types and network providers. The aim of the proposed platform is to provide a unique interface for the user, through which he can manage connected devices and visualize data coming from them, regardless of their network technology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Despite efforts exerted by the Electricity and Water Authority of the Kingdom of Bahrain (EWA), the Kingdom has one of the highest energy consumptions per capita at a rate of 11,500 kWh as of 2017. The rate is estimated to increase by 6–8% a year. The drop in oil prices has led to an increase in electricity prices in the Kingdom, which directly impacted the consumers. This in turn has opened doors for research in the domain of energy conservation. One way to achieve energy conservation is by avoiding energy-wasting behaviors and habits. In the modern era of information-based decision making, feedback technologies have shown a great potential in reducing energy consumption. Up to 20% reduction has been reported with the latest advancements in the feedback technology. In this study, an experiment was conducted by installing feedback devices in five different houses. In the first 20 days, the participants were only educated on electricity saving practices recommended by EWA and were not given access to feedback displays. This was done to monitor their regular electricity consumption behavior using the same devices to ensure accuracy. In the second phase of the experiment, participants were provided with access to the feedback monitors with displays real-time consumption information. Consumption data of the 5 houses were recorded and analyzed. Additionally, interviews were conducted with the families at the termination of the experiment to understand the unquantifiable aspects of the study. The research study reported an overall reduction of 12% in the electricity consumption with a variation from 3.9 to 25.7%. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={With the rapid and recent development of Internet of things (IoT), Bigdata, the most fundamental challenge is to explore the large volume of data from heterogeneous data sources (logs, audio, video, reports, news, social media, etc.). The tools and techniques that are being used in successful transforming of structured data into business intelligence simply do not work when it comes to unstructured data. An estimated 80% of data held by firms today are unstructured. We have powerful computations tools such as graphics processor units (GPUs) for complex calculations and Hadoop, spark for Bigdata management still technology is lacking in complete utilization of available data. Deep learning is a powerful tool to resolve the issues related to data, such as automatic extraction of complex data and representation of large volume unsupervised and uncategorized raw data. But extracted data do not have any standard format. In the survey of Bigdata mining system and IoT systems, it has been found that a layer is needed in Bigdata mining framework that can work on structured, unstructured and semi-structured data and can integrate the complete raw data. The proposed framework is a multilayer deep learning model that performed the clustering of unstructured huge text data followed by classification layer, CNN, to extract features and classify the raw data clusters in parallel manner. Conversion of unstructured data in standard format by automates content tagging helps decision-making systems to easily identify the related data and increase the data utilization. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Many countries are facing the problem of sustainable solid waste management for a long time. The quantity of generating solid waste increase varies quickly as the rate of the population grows. Now, presently the government has focused on all waste segmentation levels like waste generated evolves and the technologies available to collect and process it. Many new advanced analytical techniques have been proposed for dealing with sustainable solid waste management problems. These advanced tools help the organizations to analyze municipal solid waste raw data, which is stored by local municipal bodies. We have used many innovative analytical tools and technology, such as data mining technology. On these analytical technologies, the clustering data classification technique is one of them. This paper focuses on K-mean clustering algorithms and their working in context with solid waste management. The analysis algorithms have been played an important role in decision making process. This type of algorithm helps the main decision-makers to make the right decisions or helps to improve the efficiency of the decision-making process. An excellent solid waste management framework must include all disturbing factors, including pollution generation, land use, energy use, financial costs, labor needs, monitoring, recycling rates, etc. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={This study aimed to obtain a thoughtful understanding of contemporary zakat from young adults in Indonesia. This study also tried to solve the problems of zakat collection in Indonesia by using digital technology. This study used quantitative analysis through questionnaire for 113 Muslim young adults in Indonesia. The results proved that digitization in form of digital platform can increase the trust of society toward zakat management organization. In addition, it increased zakat donation through digital transaction. The results also indicated that digital platform can be the medium to increase social financial literacy and inclusion; it is because Muslim young adults have the understanding of contemporary zakat, and they know about the digital platform of zakat management organization. As the result, it can increase zakat payment behaviour. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},
